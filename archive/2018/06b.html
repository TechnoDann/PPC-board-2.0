            <p>Well, maybe two.<br><br>First, Imperial or Stormcloak (or neither). It doesn&#39;t make a huge difference gameplay-wise, but picking one does exclude the other, it does alter the political landscape, and it will make a difference to the ultimate fate of Skyrim and Tamriel. And picking either, bringing an end to the war, is better than neither.

Again, not a HUGE difference to gameplay, but pretty big ramifications for the overall stability of Skyrim.<br><br>Oh, and the culmination of the Dark Brotherhood questline is actually kind of a big deal.

Everyone is welcome, whether they've wandered in for the free food and drinks or are actually looking to meet people (whether for platonic or non-platonic purposes. Hey, you can make friends in the strangest of places!)</p>

<p>At one of the tables is one Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS. Being a former Jack Harkness character replacement, he's quite used to getting attention--and he loves it. He's here to make as many friends, acquaintances, and everything in between as possible, and will talk to absolutely anyone who cares to approach him.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Essentially, this started up when, in the middle of a Discord roleplay, I mentioned it would be amusing to write something for the badfic games about Jacques going around and trying to flirt with as many agents as he could find. Then it became 'well, it would be interesting to get lists of how all different agents would react and then write based on that...' which in turn became 'there could be a thread somewhere to get IC lists?' which Thoth then said should be a roleplay thread. So, after a bit of convincing, here we are.</p>

<p>(There was a speed-dating roleplay thread in the past. I have not tracked it down to check exactly how it worked, and am not the one who ran it. If anyone remembers something from it that would make this one run smoother, feel free to mention!)</p>

<p>While this did start because of Jacques and he is mentioned above, he's by no means the only person around! He's just the agent I'm immediately throwing out there, because, let's face it, this is exactly his scene. He will cheerfully flirt and/or make friends with anyone who's open to it.</p>

<p>Please do start many subthreads that have nothing to do with him. Multiple conversations with the same characters are quite fine as well--speed-dating is built for it!</p>

<p>And, as always, Permission is unnecessary for RP participation. All are welcome!</p>

<p>Enjoy, I hope?</p>

<p>~Z</p>

<p>PS: Should you wish to, perhaps, mention how even characters you don't want to actually throw in here would react to being flirted with by Jacques...well, you may see that (perhaps deliberately poorly) fictionalized come the next Badfic Games in September ;) The more amusing the better!</p>

            <p>She'd gotten the invitation to this "speed dating" event, and she'd thought it was a good idea to come. She wasn't really looking for romance, but she'd only been in HQ for a few weeks now, and thought she'd come and get to know some people. Before heading down, she'd given her mane a more careful trim than usual.</p>

<p>(( Now, being flirted with by Jacques:
- Once Peregrin had realized what was happening, it'd set him to reminiscing about his youth and also explaining he's not that interested.
- Taq would be kinda weirded out by this
- Kk'kttak's reaction would be along the lines of "crazy humans" and being pretty uninterested if/when he noticed the attempt
- Farah would likely flirt back a bit, though it probably wouldn't go too far.
- Florian is Not Interested. They're also basically a Dalek with a bunch of fire hoses and water canons and such attached, and so probably not prime flirting material. ))</p>

<p>The Aviator would flirt back with heavy sarcasm
Zeb would be like "Oh, are we on another date? :D"
Charlotte and Ix: Well, you know,
Dax flirts back
Lorson sits there stony-faced
Farilan laughs derisively
Alex just grins
And Olivine gives him a puzzled look and goes "Hang on, are you flirting, Squishy?"</p>

She'd worn the same thing she'd worn on a short, easy mission earlier that day, which was to say her skirt was colorful, her shirt was black and had a potted cactus flashpatch on the shoulder, and her hair was in its usual very long braid. She'd redone the latter for neatness and added a ribbon into the braiding as her sole concession to being at an event. "Do you mind if I sit?

<p>Still, shapeshifting? That was pretty cool, even if she could technically do it herself with the disguise generator. Maybe just trying to pretend he <i>was</i> Jacques would help with talking, too.</p>

            <p>Annoyingly, her cheeks were heating up again. It was the suddenness of the invitation that had done it; she wasn't used to people flirting with her at random, and especially not with dinner offers. Definitely not dinner offers within half an hour of meeting her.</p>

<p>Then again, could this really be called random? It <i>was</i> technically a speed-dating event, and she <i>had</i> chosen to sit down here...</p>

<p>"I do like stories," she said cautiously, "and that really does sound pretty interesting--and, well, food is always great, I like food, everyone likes food--but I'm not, uh, really looking for...well, I came here mostly to make friends. Or <i>maybe</i> find someone to date, but that'd be more by chance, I think--I'm not really, seriously, actively <i>looking</i>.

<p>"I don't", Dagger was quick to opine. "In case you thought I did." The surly Dragonborn trailed slightly, as if trying to distance himself.</p>

<p>"Fiiine... I'll just leave my <em>fascinating</em> technical trivia by the wayside, then." Tom sighed. "With my winning personality, I'm sure people will be throwing themselves at me..."</p>

<p>Talia grinned. "Oh, don't worry so much. I'm sure someone will want to hang with an absolute doofus."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not that bad." Tom frowned. "No, my real question is, what the hell is Dagger doing here?"</p>

<p>"That's easy," said Dagger. "Free food. I got recruited out of college. Never broke the habit of not turning down a free meal."</p>

<p>((Yes, everyone but Thoth. I wanted to give them all a bit of time to shine, because he's the one who gets all the focus usually. :-(.</p>

<p>Anyways, responses to flirting:</p>

<p>Thoth - Depending on the mood, explain he's not interested, brush it off (possibly with a side of condescention), or find some way to mess with whoever's throwing it at him.</p>

<p>Tom - Seeing as we're talking about a guy, he's be horrifyingly embarrassed, awkward, and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Talia - Go along with it. Possibly with some snark on the side. Unlikely to take it any further than that.</p>

<p>Dagger - Most likely, outright hostility, sarcasm, and general bitterness (contrast his usual apathetic grumpiness—wait, you haven't seen enough of him to do that yet). Even if he finds the guy attractive. Yes, he is into guys. Is this surprising? :-P))</p>

<p>He was glad this event was happening, even if not too many people had shown up yet. It felt nice, having a break from missions which was specifically set aside to talk to people. Who knew how many strangers would show up? He'd been an agent for five years, but that (unfortunately) didn't mean he'd managed to meet the whole of HQ's population. For one thing, HQ was big; for another, not everyone frequented the same places, or <i>any</i> places outside their own RCs. Moreover, new people were coming in all the time...</p>

<p>This was going to be fun. He could already tell. Who knew how many friends (and 'friends') he'd manage to make here? And he could get to know people he already knew a bit better--he could see a few of them in the room...</p>

<p>Yes, this was definitely going to be fun.</p>

            <p>Gall thunked her third glass of mead down on the table and stared across it at her partner. “You’ve <i>never</i> cooked for yourself? Not once?”<br><br>“Why would I?” Derik glowered at her, taking umbrage at her extreme disbelief. “More to the point: <i>when</i> would I? My time was thoroughly occupied with studying, then raising a dragonet, then being a dragonrider.”<br><br>Frowning in skepticism, she held out her hands as though to encompass a simple object. “But it’s, like, a basic life skill.”<br><br>He snorted. “It’s called division of labor. I sing, they cook; I fly, they cook; I mission, they cook.” He indicated Rudi’s kitchen with a gesture.<br><br>“But . . . you never even cooked out or anything? You know, meat on a stick, fire, something even the biggest, dumbest idiot should be able to do without totally screwing it up?”<br><br>“With that attitude, I suppose you’re some sort of culinary expert.” He chuckled, plainly very amused with the notion.<br><br>Gall regarded him quite seriously. “My father and I lived in exile for eight years. You met my father. Who do you think made that whole thing work?”<br><br>That gave him pause. “Well, all right, but feeding yourself isn’t the same as cooking. Like you said, any idiot can roast meat on a stick, right?”<br><br>She rolled her eyes. “Freya’s tits. That’s it. You. Me. General Store. Now.”<br><br>“What? But—” He gestured to the half-finished food and drinks on the table, but Gall was already up and tugging on his arm.<br><br>“Now!”<br><br>“All right, all right!” He downed the last half of his ale as he rose and just managed to get the glass back on the table upright as he was dragged out of the pub.<br><br>Twenty minutes later, Derik found himself sitting in the moon-lit Courtyard with his sleeves rolled up and his fingers sunk into a mound of barley and wheat flour on a flat, freshly scrubbed rock. A small fire, courtesy of Fellrazer, gave additional light. Occasionally, a horse or a wolf would wander by to see what was going on, but the presence of the dragon, curled up on a patch of ground he’d toasted to a comfortable warmth, discouraged them from getting too close.<br><br>Gall hovered at Derik’s elbow, watching his progress. “Okay, you’ve got your flax, your lard, and my personal very secret ingredients that you will not share with anyone on pain of asskicking. Now just work it until it comes together—carefully! If you mess up that well, your bread is screwed. Here, look. Like this.”<br><br>She pushed up her own sleeves and slid her fingers in with his. Derik followed her guidance, and together they pulled the dry ingredients into the wet, first mixing, then kneading. Their hands got slick with the grease and flax, and slid easily over each other. After a few minutes, they had a uniform round of dough.<br><br>“There. That’s good.” Gall nodded, then gave him one of those looks, like she expected or hoped for something from him.<br><br>After a moment spent deciding how to respond, Derik folded his hands in his lap and said, “So now what?”<br><br>Gall shrugged. “It rests overnight, and we get fresh, hot bread in the morning.”<br><br>“Really.” Derik raised an eyebrow. “I don’t see an oven.”<br><br>“You don’t lug an oven around on a raid, genius.” She punched his shoulder for his quibble. “It bakes on a rack over the fire, or you wrap it around a stick. In this case, stick-bread. Only one rack to be had around here, and it ain’t for baking.” She grinned.<br><br>Derik’s mind resolutely sidled around the come-on. “In the meantime, we’ve got a lump of dough sitting on a rock in the middle of the Courtyard. What’s the plan for that?”<br><br>“Wanna camp out?”<br><br>“You don’t get enough of that on missions?”<br><br>“That’s because we have to. This is because we want to. It’s totally different.”<br><br>Try as he might, Derik couldn’t fault her logic. And it was nice to be safe from Suvians or rogue time skips under a wide, starry sky, even if it was fake. He couldn’t think why he didn’t come here more often.<br><br>“You don’t think it’ll get too cold?” he said.<br><br>“Well, if it does,” Gall started eagerly, and then, with a visible effort, turned the remark in a different direction. She’d tried the spooning for warmth tactic before, to no avail. “I’ve got Fellrazer,” she finished. “Anyway, it’s not like we’re in the Archipelago or somewhere it gets proper cold. This is nothing.”<br><br>“True enough. All right, I suppose I don’t mind. And in the morning, we’ll see if this recipe of yours actually turns out edible.” He got up to go wash off in the nearby stream.<br><br>Gall sprang up after him and gave him a shove, setting him off-balance for a step. “No, we’ll see if you aren’t a completely pathetic waste of space when it comes to practical skills.”<br><br>Once recovered, he shoved back. “I have many practical skills.”<br><br>“Oh yeah? Name one.”<br><br>“Functional literacy?”<br><br>“Nah, that’s a fancy-pants Harper skill. Try again.”<br><br>This continued while they scrubbed the fat off their hands and while Gall wrapped the bread dough in the empty barley flour package. Finally, they settled down on the grass under a large elm tree and went to sleep.<br><br>In the morning, there was fresh, hot stick-bread, it was indeed edible, and both partners considered it time well spent.<br><br><hr>
<br>Viking flatbread recipe yoinked from a YouTube video I&#39;ve since lost track of, based on findings from <a href="http://www.archaeology.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.172819.1396250886!/menu/standard/file/LA9.Hansson.pdf">this study</a>.<br><br>The stick-bread comes from commenters on the video, who remarked that the recipe sounds similar to something still made in Scandinavian countries today.<br><br>I kinda want to try this myself... we&#39;ll see.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Y&#39;know, when the banter is just banter and not actual fighting...<br><br>Actually, in all seriousness, the more I play with the ship, the more I see how it can be nearly stable. Not totally stable, cuz look who we&#39;re dealing with, but considering Gall settling down a bit as she gets older and Derik getting more of a grip with help from his bro Thoth? There will certainly be bumps in the road, but the ship won&#39;t totally derail and fall out of the sky because of them.<br><br>... I think I have lost track of what kind of vehicle this actually is.<br><br>In any case, I&#39;m having a lot of fun using these prompts to set it up. Much easier than trying to do it in missions alone. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed this one. Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The morning, like all other mornings in RC 112358 over the last few years, began with the sound of bells. Peregrin woke up and read the (Arban) date off the clock tower he&#39;d built in the RC. <em>Two hundred and forty six years now,</em> he thought, <em>plus or minus a day.</em> It was, unless HQ had been messing with time to excess, his birthday.<br><br><em>I wonder if I should make an announcement.</em> Peregrin thought, as he was sitting up and getting out of bed. Back home, a birthday generally passed with a remark at a meal with an accompanying toast, or possibly during Proventer. Headquarters, however, was much too large for these types of communal gatherings. So, his last three birthdays had been quite small affairs. Last year, his now-former partner Tomash had taken him to a rather nice restaurant in New Caledionia, for example.<br><br><em>Or I could organize a party.</em> he continued thinking as he wound the tower. This wasn&#39;t something he ever needed to do, as the clock had to be able to keep itself running when he was on missions, but the mechanism made the RC a bit closer to just another extremely remote math. <em>But who would I invite?</em> he wondered. <em>And the organization would take significant energy so that is a bad idea.</em><br><br>Pondering potential birthday plans and wondering what the giggling child a fewt doors down was up to got Peregrin through to lifting the weight on the clock all the way up to the top of the tower. <em>I suppose I could simply go to Rudi&#39;s, maybe invite Tomash or Taq.</em> he concluded as he walked towards a chair. <em>Yes, that is a reasonable way to mark the year. Yes.</em><br><br>&quot;Taq?&quot; he asked his partner, who was also waking up.<br><br>&quot;Sir?&quot;<br><br>An annoyed look crossed Peregrin&#39;s face. &quot;Would you be interested in—&quot;<br><br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEP!/Dong, dong....]<br><br>The console went off, along with the bell sequence for Voco that was meant to replace the beeping.<br><br>&quot;Thought he&#39;d fixed...&quot; Peregrin muttered as he shut off the alarm.<br><br>&quot;What&#39;d you want, boss?&quot; Taq asked once the noise had died down.<br><br>&quot;Birthday plans.&quot; Peregrin replied. &quot;Not important at the moment.&quot; <em>I should have seen this coming.</em><br><br>(( - Tomash<br><br>Thanks to Thoth for checking for typos. ))</p>

It does a good job of keeping the writing contained, while also telling us a little about Peregrin. Metaphorically, it also casts Peregrin as a &#39;clockwork&#39; figure himself: his stream of consciousness comes over as even more structured and logic-focussed than it perhaps already would. The repeated &quot;Yes... yes.&quot; in his final thought takes on overtones of a tick... tick... tick. It&#39;s good use of the frame to enhance the narrative.<br><br>hS<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed reading this.<br><br>A lot of the overtones you noticed (like the structure of the final thought) weren&#39;t things I set out to do when writing, so yay for accidentally doing cool stuff?<br><br>And Peregrin&#39;s stream of consciousness being logic-focused is a character trait of his, mainly arising from his being a theoretical physicist/mathematician from a cross between a monastery and a university. It sounds like I might need to work on better ways to represent his thought process, though, since it certainly isn&#39;t as systematic as a computer or clock (it&#39;s the usual jumping to possibilities and pruning out things that look like they wouldn&#39;t work).<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Loosely based off a true story.<br>------<br><br>In a moment of pure and utter shame, Jordan picked up his phone, and called Harris.<br><br>&quot;Oh hey Jordan, wait just a moment so I can put you on speakerphone. I&#39;m in the car right now.&quot;<br><br>As he listened to Harris&#39; fumbling in the car, Jordan grimaced.<br><br>&quot;All good now.

I know you don&#39;t cook a lot, but you gotta know something.&quot;<br>&quot;I mean yeah, sure there&#39;s ways to cook well, but pasta? You just take a pot of water and boil it, and shove some spaghetti or something in. It can&#39;t be that bad.&quot;<br>&quot;It really, really was that bad. Can you please please please just give me some instructions? I&#39;m making penne for Aaron tonight.&quot;<br>&quot;How can you mess up pasta terribly? It&#39;s two ingredients. Pasta and water.&quot;<br>&quot;The pasta caught fire; just tell me what to do.&quot;<br>&quot;Wo-HAH WAIT HAHH WHAT HOW HAH HAH HAA-&quot;<br><br>Jordan hung up while Harris was cackling, and poured the ashes in the pot into the trash.

            <p>Ce’rana of Borune glared at the pan as yet another of these thin shells tore and muttered irritably as she was forced to scrape it into the filling garbage can. “Ridiculous thing,” she grumbled, reaching for her bowl of batter to begin the process once more. “How is it that you are so fragile and people can still make you work?”<br><br>She sighed as she ladeled it into the pan. “The only reason I bother with you is that someone refused to share. If he wanted it all for himself, he could easily have waited for me to leave - but no, he had to show off how well he could do this. On that note, how is it that he makes it seem effortless to keep you in one piece? Is there some mysterious technique that I have failed to discover yet?”<br><br>The Dryad managed to become more and more irritated as she spread the batter around, perhaps a bit thicker than was strictly necessary this time. “And if I were to ask him how it is that he makes it seem so easy, all he would say is that he has more practice than I do. So if there is some secret that I am unaware of, he would not tell me, merely leave me to figure it out on my own, infuriating thing that he is.”<br><br>She glanced over at the tub of Nutella, which <i>had</i> been locked up and covered in chains until Alex came back. “And this. I am not <i>that</i> bad with chocolate, Alex. There really is no need to take such measures with it whenever you leave the room. As though I could not get past something so simple.” She chuckled to herself at that; he had no idea of her past hobbies, obviously, or he would have taken measures a bit less flimsy than a pair of two-pin locks.<br><br>Of course, that was just <i>too</i> tempting to the IO. The container fell from its shelf, popping open when it hit the floor, dragged by the weight of the chains she had left around its base. The resulting mess spattered all across the floor.<br><br>Ce’rana simply stared, first at the goopy brown mess, then at the garbage can full of failed crepes, then the shell that was presently trying to burn. <br><br>“What smells like burning crepes?” Alex stepped into the room, a cheerful grin on his face which faded immediately as he beheld the absolute mess on his side of the room. “Ce’rana. What did you <i>do?”</i><br><br>She looked up at him helplessly. “I…” Words failed for her for a moment before she came up with a simple, effective answer. “I have no idea.”<br><br>Alex walked over and sighed. “If I make you a crepe, will you clean up your mess? I was hoping to get sleep at some point today.”<br><br>The tiny agent looked around for a moment, taking stock of exactly how much cleaning she would have to do. <i>Well, I suppose this is mostly just scrubbing the floor,</i> she decided. “That sounds like a very good idea. Though would you be offended if I ask how it is you manage to make them not fall apart?”<br><br><i>“Sì, certo.”</i> He moved in to carefully pour and spread the next crepe. “It is all about being gentle and slow. You just have to wait until it’s nice and ready, then carefully slide the rod under the delicate batter. Get it nice and loose, then pull it up and quickly flip it over. Then, it’s finally time to fill it.” He began to spoon the leftover nutella onto the crepe, getting it ready.<br><br>Ce’rana close to ignore the massive pile of hopefully-accidental innuendo (though she couldn’t avoid what she hoped was a small smirk) in favor of leaning a little closer to make sure she could see exactly how Alex was going about getting the shell ready to be flipped.<br><br>Once the nutella was in the shell, Alex folded it over and easily scooped it onto a plate. <i>“Merda,</i>now I want one.” He poured out another shell’s worth of batter as he offered the plate to Ce’rana.<br><br>She took it with a smile, then stepped away to grab a pair of forks and a second plate. “Thank you, Alex,” she said sweetly.<br><br><i>“Va Bene.”</i> He started to get the shell ready to flip, smiling softly. “Don’t feel bad about not knowing how to do it easily. I’ve been learning how to do it properly since I was six years old. With that much practice, it was bound to get easier.”<br><br>And just like that, the shell tore. Ce’rana couldn’t keep herself from breaking into laughter at his expression.<br><br>“Oh, <i>figlio di-”</i></p>

            <p>For both platonic and non-platonic intent, despite the name. All welcome (regardless of Permission status). Of my characters, Jacques Bonnefoy (who kind of spawned this whole thing) is quite available to talk to, by anyone who wishes to show up.<br><br>This RP is happening over at the T-Board! <a href="https://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/posts/6063">The link is here</a>. Come check it out! A more complete explanation of both the RP setting and how it came about is there as well.<br><br>And one more thing: I&#39;m interested in collecting, for the Badfic Games, descriptions of how agents would react to being flirted with by a wandering Jacques. A little more detail on that is on T-Board as well. If you&#39;d like to potentially see your agents show up in a badfic to be flirted with, leave me a post! Unsuccessful reactions definitely welcome as well! My goal here is to get a sampling of HQ (and probably amuse us all with the responses in the process).<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>You know what I&#39;m rubbish at? Editing. For some reason, while I can churn out a novel-length story (on five occasions, in under 30 days), I have a nightmare of a time trying to sit down and edit it into something worth having - or, for instance, worth <i>publishing</i> (that long-time dream of any writer).<br><br>Part of the reason is that, well, publishing a novel sounds <i>hard</i>. If I plunge myself into editing (which often = completely rewriting), only for no-one to ever read it... what&#39;s the point?<br><br>So we come to this thread, a neat weaponisation of elevator pitches in the war against apathy. Below are titles, first lines, and five-second summaries of each of my four candidate novels (they&#39;re all NaNos, so they all exist as ~50K-word stories). What I&#39;m hoping you will do is read through them, click on the link to the survey, and select which of the four you&#39;d be most likely to read if it was published. :) (It&#39;s literally just the one question - no name or anything. Takes about ten seconds.)<br><br>And <i>then</i> what I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll do is write up your own title-firstline-elevatorpitch post, scrape together a <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/forms/about/">Google Form</a>, and post it so that I (and everyone else) can say what we think of <i>your</i> ideas. And maybe that&#39;ll inspire you, too, to get down to some heavy editing, and eventually seeing your name on the cover of a paperback down at the local bookshop. :)<br><br><hr>

            <p>Though in a different vein from Delta&#39;s. For the most part, I&#39;m not planning new spin-offs--I&#39;m planning to go back and develop and write for characters I already created who may have gotten a little sidelined, or just plain had their stories delayed. I also have ideas for arcs, and partially finished stories lying around. This is a combination of all that. I do already have a sense of what I’ll be working on first, but I’d love to know what people are interested in!<br><br><b>Without Me (You&#39;ll Be Cold in Summer)</b><br><br><i>&quot;[...] To say that a Klingon has no honor is to provoke a fight to the death.&quot;<br><br>Allison was gaping at him. &quot;That--that&#39;s--&quot;<br><br>&quot;We are a very warlike people,&quot; Kozar said helpfully. When his new partner continued to gape he grinned at her, sharp and amused. &quot;I have had a Terran partner before, Allison. I know how to make allowance for innocent mistakes.&quot;</i><br><br>This is a planned set of interludes, with probably a couple of missions as well. The focus? <s>The epic tale of</s> Kozar&#39;s first DIC partnership (in 2013-14), with a human named Allison Brown. She and her character arc actually predate Kozar; even so, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t start off with her, because she&#39;s now had the chance to develop a <i>lot</i>, and I like how she&#39;s turned out. She&#39;s been mentioned here and there without a name, and recently got her first appearance in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PszjhFk2ktk3QkRW9Pfx---K8OmmDgYXqlR6TD92YbQ/edit?usp=sharing">this interlude</a>, where Kozar dreams of her.<br><br>Essentially: Allison Brown, a mostly comics- and parody musicals-oriented young American woman, wakes up in the PPC and soon finds herself partnered with an alien from a series she knows nothing about. Kozar, meanwhile, has finally gotten repartnered after his move to the DIC (following a tribble incident. Of the sort where his human partner refused to get rid of one). This new partner? <i>Another</i> human. Somehow, it works. Unfortunately, tragedy is waiting in the offing...<br><br><b>Mission: &#39;Partially Kissed Hero,&#39; or It Gets Worse</b><br><br><i>Dawn McKenna whistled to herself as she wandered through the grey hallways of the Headquarters of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. Had anyone she knew been in earshot, they would have been unsurprised to recognize the </i>Pirates of the Caribbean<i> theme; as it was, only the walls bore witness.</i><br><br>Dawn McKenna and Jacques Bonnefoy go on a mission to a Legendary Badfic. It is quite possibly the weirdest mission either of them has ever faced. In short? It’s Partially Kissed Hero.<br><br>(Yup. This is happening. It’s going to be <i>fun</i>, y’all. And I’m not even being completely sarcastic.)<br><br><b>Mission: &#39;Blade,&#39; or &quot;...and razed you from hobbition&quot;</b><br><br><i>&quot;Give me a new partner,” Brenda insisted. &quot;One that wasn&#39;t a Suethor two days ago.&quot;<br><br></i>No.<br><br><i>“Why not?”<br><br></i>It’s DMS policy not to switch partners before the first mission.<i><br><br>“You made that up.”<br><br>The SO shifted some paperwork around on the table and didn’t reply.</i><br><br>Once upon a time, I got Permission with agents Brenda Loringham and Charlie Shoe. They, uh, fell to the wayside somewhat, appearing primarily in an April Fool&#39;s Day mission, the comments section of several Multiverse Monitor theater reviews, and quite a few unpublished (or unfinished <i>and</i> unpublished) interludes and missions. One of these unfinished and unpublished missions was their first, to a badfic called &quot;Blade.&quot;<br><br>Now, I want to rewrite and finish that first mission of theirs.<br><br>Senior agent Brenda Loringham and recent OFUM graduate Charlie Shoe try their best not to kill each other while taking on Laiqualassiel, Grelvish-speaking half-elven healer and last of the nymphs of Middle-earth.<br><br><b>Untitled Jacques-Calaquendi Interlude (2014)</b><br><br><i>Jacques Bonnefoy stood on a grassy Rohirric hill, swaying slightly in the wind. Faint glittery smears on the grass were the only sign of the Sue he’d just pushed through a portal to the current location of a pack of Wargs.</i><br><br>In 2014, Jacques Bonnefoy ends up accidentally visiting the pair of First Age Elves he did a mission with earlier on in the same year. A friendship continues to unfurl between Gurnirel and Naergondir and the human they spent days with in Hobbit disguise, who turns out to be a weirdly immortal human with a still-settling personality.<br><br><b>The ’Verses Aim to Misbehave (Blackout Interlude)</b><br><br><i>“Sherlock? </i>Sherlock!”<br>    <br>“Ssshh!”<i> A. J. Crowley rounded on the flatmate of the consulting detective in question. “There’s a meatloaf monster running around! Sstop yelling!”</i><br><br>Yup, this is the Blackout Interlude, as I started calling it ages before giving it a proper title. Set during the 2013 HQ Blackout, this is the ongoing, ever-growing “interlude” that, uh, isn’t finished yet. Involved in it are a large cadre of characters, as one might expect: it begins with Dawn, involves the author getting thrown into the mix, featured the original first appearance of Kozar and the Reader (as written by me, anyway, the Reader may have already shown up in the Continuity Council planning?) and just plain has a whole bunch of canon characters in there as well (from Supernatural, Sherlock, Good Omens…) And that’s not all! Tune in for more parts (the first three were posted, and at some point I started overhauling it…?) to find out where Castiel wandered off to, why exactly Kozar, the Reader, and Sherlock are finding people hanging upside down from lampposts in HQ, how Jack Harkness knew the Doctor had been in the PPC (see the end of Lily Winterwood’s interlude for reference), and where in the world Jacques came into this mess…and even more!<br><br>…in short? A Blackout romp, featuring many canon characters, the recruitment of an agent pair, the first meeting of future friends (also agents), and a mystery or three. Also, a nice little handful of meta. The original versions of the first three parts can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vc4hOg2-V18jE7IbWHzIWxcjWs0ODt-LGNLQv1QdMnE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>; the ‘first lines’ above are technically from the beginning of one of the scenes in the fourth part.<br><br><b>The Wandering Baron</b><br><br><i>Eshakhar sat in a nicely, if simply, carved wooden chair in her study at the Castle of Dawn.</i><br><br>A Plort story, in which newly-minted Baron Eshakhar reflects on her new status and the fate of her old friend. Set about a year ago.<br><br><b>Untitled Reader/Naya Piece (Interlude)</b><br><br><i>It was a nice day, probably, the Reader thought.</i><br><br>The Reader tries to come up with and perfect a gift for Naya. There is poetry. It is bad. Kozar makes an appearance.<br><br><b>Dawn&#39;s LotR Nightmare (tentative title)</b><br><br><i>Jacques woke up, oddly enough, to a familiar voice telling him to get up. Or, well, it seemed to be talking to him...it was a little hard to tell.<br><br>“Ardir,” the voice said. A gentle hand squeezed his shoulder. “Ardir, you must awaken. We will soon have guests, and I will have need of your help. Make haste.”<br><br>“Listen,” Jacques said, and began to open his eyes, wondering as he did so why no one else was in his bed, “I think you might have the--”<br><br>Here he stopped, and stared.</i><br><br>An old, about half-written idea that I think was meant for April Fool&#39;s Day (and semi-canonical at best), in which Dawn and a small handful of other agents wake up to find themselves acting out the Fellowship of the Ring events (with some additions)...in disguise...and without any PPC technology. Follow along as they try to figure out how they got there and what they can do to stop the story and get home!<br><br>(Aka, the one in which many, many people for some reason resemble Dawn, only a handful of people are real, there are First Age Elves playing Hobbits, bookverse characters exist, there are some suspiciously Sueish characters floating around, and it&#39;s very possible the whole thing started with a bit too much fun with a LotR dollmaker on dolldivine.)<br><br>(This isn&#39;t currently that high on my list of stories to finish, but...I&#39;m curious to see if there&#39;s interest in it).<br><br><b>Untitled Reader/Naya alternate meeting (short AU)</b><br><br><i>Naya had been looking forward to the party, in a way that was really partly just about getting to see her partners in a party setting.</i><br><br>An alternate universe story in which Naya didn&#39;t attend a TARDIS repair session and the Guardsman and the Reader never resolved their differences. Instead, Naya meets an awkward young Time Lady at a social event and has a sharp discussion with her partner to finally set the record straight.

            <p>Twice over the years, I&#39;ve had dreams that were basically fully plotted stories.  I wrote down everything I could remember immediately after waking up . . . unfortunately, I was unable to find the paper with the notes tonight, so they may be dead in the water.  But just for the sake of sharing the ideas with you folks:<br><br>[the one where zookepers secretly worship an ancient nature deity]<br>After discovering something primal and powerful buried underneath their land, the higher-up zookeepers begin to follow a dark path, and the lives of neither the animals they once cared about, nor their own human coworkers, hold much value to their rapidly slipping consciences.  But then again, their new god holds their lives in equally low regard.<br><br>[the one that I barely remember but basically looked at a haunted property from a historical perspective throughout many decades]<br>Before it was restored and remodeled into the modern-day community center, that building has been many things over the years.  The warm, safe home of a broken family.  A hideout for Prohibition-dodgers.  An ostensible dormitory that morphed into a college party house.  A sanctuary for the homeless.  But two things have always been constant: the deaths, and the black cat.<br><br>So yeah.  If I don&#39;t find those notes, I&#39;ll need to do some serious focused thought on these to be able to recreate all the details from the original dreams.  And I&#39;m more focused on my PPC fiction anyway, so.  Probably don&#39;t count on seeing these published ever?

            <p>Because I&#39;ve got a bunch of different spin-off ideas running around, and no clue which one I want to write most. Here&#39;s my favorites!<br><br><b>Friday the Thirteenth</b><br><br>Grace Trouble Hopper Byron Null knew it was going to be a bad day when she found the first note. It simply read <i>Sorry</i>, in her own handwriting.<br><br>(Time shenanigans. Grace Null is many things: slacker, bartender, HQ kid, time traveler… and she and her TARDIS are often the thin line between HQ and Emergencies. This is made slightly more complicated by the nature of HQ, time, fandom, and the part where her moms are around in the present.)<br><br><b>Fish and Feathers</b><br><br>“Talia,” Sarah said, oddly calmly, without looking up from the shattered display case that a tense shift had thrown her into. “I am probably going to burst into flames in the near future.”<br><br>(Department of Redundancy Department - who are now very overworked by the load of time-loop fics. Sarah thought she was from World One. She thought she was human. And then she got chucked into a magical artifact from her homeworld, and now she&#39;s trying to balance being an Agent, being the partner of a very polyamorous Trekkie, and being a phoenix, too.)<br><br><b>Procedural Codes</b><br><br>“You should just kill her,” Nala said, not breaking eye contact with the black-clad figure in the interview cell, as her fingers itched to hold the lightsaber at her hip. “She’s Sith, it’d be a kindness.”<br><br><i>On the contrary</i>, the Tiger Lily said. <i>We’ve recruited her. Nala Sage, meet Beshaura Kell. Your new partner.</i><br><br>(Department of Internal Affairs - Nala Sage was a Jedi. Then she was a fugitive, then she was a DIA Agent. Now she just has to worry about not murdering her partner. Or getting murdered by her. A procedural, with lightsabers.)<br><br><b>Duct Tape</b><br><br>“I’m sorry,” Julia said, pointing across the lab, “I’m actually over there right now.” The agent turned, saw Agent Dann in profile - and in that moment, Julia ducked and scuttled under the workbench. Out of sight, out of mind, and she breathed a quiet “sorry” in the direction of her doppleganger as the agent who had been bothering her set off across the Lab in pursuit of Dann.<br><br>(Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology! Newbie Julia takes on the multiverse, asking fun questions like “why is this broken?” and “how does that work?” and “why does this ‘Dann’ guy look just like me?”)<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGwQ9bWcrJkvRIx8xV3rO3-leKIOsPe6Zz8Vr7VxhwI8g63w/viewform?usp=sf_link">The survey!</a></p>

            <p>I voted for <i>Procedural Codes</i>. It&#39;s been a long time since we had a decent look at the DIA, and with the loss of Black and Irvine&#39;s spinoff their canon is mostly appearances where they&#39;re causing way more trouble than they should for people. (I take my share of the blame in this, since Selene was I think the very first recipient of DIA harassment.) So I think this would be excellent to see - and the characters sound like a good sparking point.<br><br>For the second question, I also ticked <i>Fish and Feathers</i>. As (I think) the only writer for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/pub?id=1VNyAq6Ob_sujX_yCyhHSMnfXeFYbKs_B3eI6H-iiCIw">DRD</a> (no, I take it back; apparently someone did it way back in &#39;05), I&#39;d be excited to see more of it. And, again, the characters sound fun.<br><br>For the final question, I&#39;m afraid I ticked <i>Friday the Thirteenth</i> as a potential problem. Time travel in HQ is... a tricky prospect, and again, I say this as culprit number one. I feel like it can work as a one-off incident (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vST5l3ocpjDmVDSxQpfDm1ITkRAhsKvhtS1I32KeM8ozYXlonXQL5Sj-yuuGl0x8pi-yuCg3G-bmRoj/pub">Morgan&#39;s little accident</a>, for instance), but sustained, deliberate time travel in HQ has been wisely kept away until now. It just has too many ways to break everything - and, more to the point, too many ways that it <i>should</i> break everything, and would need the story to be unreasonably warped to prevent it. (A solitary example: technology which can impersonate a living being is ridiculously common across the multiverse. Therefore, if time travel is possible in HQ, someone should by now have gone back and replaced all of DAVD with holo-androids before their deaths in <i>Crashing Down</i>, and snuck the real agents off to hide somewhere until the present.)<br><br>I also don&#39;t like that &#39;thin line between HQ and Emergencies&#39; part. &#39;One person protects [compact setting] from disaster every week&#39; doesn&#39;t work very well even in more coherent settings; in the PPC, there are hundreds of people (starting with the Flowers, and running down through all the Time Lords and anyone else with temporal sensitivity) who should <i>notice</i> this. Would the Notary let some kid muck around in time? Would Morgan let a child do what she sees as her job, protecting HQ? Would the Flowers tolerate meddling in the PPC&#39;s already-fractured internal timeline?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I could quibble over some of your concerns with <i>Friday</i>, but it&#39;s also the series I have the least sense of how it should go - I like Grace as a character, but I couldn&#39;t pitch the story for the first character arc there the way I could with the others.<br><br>(It also... kinda bugs me that you, having written Morgan, are saying (paraphrased) &quot;I don&#39;t think you should write a character who protects the PPC like Morgan&quot;? So I&#39;m trying to avoid responding to that bugging.)<br><br>Perhaps I&#39;ve mis-pitched: I wasn&#39;t picturing the story as saving the multiverse every week, that seems like it would get old quickly. Rather, I&#39;ve been thinking of Grace as a vaguely Doctorly figure; albeit one whose bailwick is centered on extradimensional and interdimensional spaces. (And in the PPC, limited by some sort of understanding/policy/Department creation at ~2008 HQST, when the hiatus on Emergencies began- Grace is one of the answers to &quot;wait, why did things stop going terribly badly all of a sudden?&quot;)<br><br>(Additional quibbling: I guess I don&#39;t think the PPC is that small of a setting, if you think of it as a fandom rather than a single world? It seems to me that there&#39;s lots of spaces for AUs and other alternate timelines and thanks to plothole shenanigans, they probably interfere with each other far more than most more settled &#39;verses. I could see a mess there in need of a minder or three.)<br><br>Bleh. Please understand that I really appreciate your feedback? You&#39;ve written in vaguely this space before, and I deeply respect your experience- my desire to quibble is driven far more by my feeling like I&#39;ve miscommunicated the idea than that I disagree with your feedback.<br><br>-Delta</p>

            <p>Morgan doesn&#39;t have a monopoly on protecting the PPC - she just feels like she <i>should</i>. So anyone who started doing &#39;her job&#39; for her would, in fairly short order, have to deal with an official visit from the Tigereye Castellan.<br><br>Which is fine <i>if that&#39;s what you want to write</i> (and if you get permission to borrow her, obvs); but that doesn&#39;t seem to be what you were thinking of.<br><br>My point with &#39;small setting&#39; is that it sounded like you were planning on having Grace mostly move in HQ; whether you assume 1000 or 100,000 agents, that&#39;s <i>tiny</i> compared to the universe the Doctor is looking after. That means a roving temporal mechanic (so to speak) will either a) have very little to do, or b) be flabbergasted by the number of ways agents nearly destroy the fabric of reality, which (given the people in HQ) would lead directly to c) lots of other time travellers and the like interfering with her by trying to fix things themselves.<br><br>As to the hiatus on Emergencies... I actually graphed this a few years back, and it turned out that there wasn&#39;t really a hiatus at all. Take a look:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QRksCEF.png"><br><br>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s happened since 2015 that would qualify, but I&#39;m certain there have been some. Just because we didn&#39;t tack the label &#39;Emergency&#39; on the Blackout, for instance, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t one... :)<br><br>I still hold that time travel within HQ must be wildly dangerous; moving in a six-dimensional space that&#39;s already known to have multiple alternate timelines would be a nightmare. Your brief description for Grace&#39;s story didn&#39;t sound like it would recognise that, which is what I was responding to.<br><br>And, well... you <i>did</i> ask... ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On the this-isn&#39;t-a-good-idea side: a potential problem with Time Gentry who specialize in HQ is that they&#39;re very hard to ignore: much like Emergencies themselves, a character who is involved in running the timeline as a whole is also involved in the timeline as a whole. And that&#39;s a thing we&#39;ve been avoiding for quite a while, in favor of wanting people to write their own stuff rather than being caught up in centralized continuity.<br><br></p>

Much like superheroes (hello, <i>Injustice</i>!), time travellers <i>have</i> to be limited in what they can do, or else you end up facing the simple question: why does anything go wrong? (Which is also a question that bugs religious people no end, though there are plenty of answers on that end.) That goes double - triple - when they&#39;re limited to a fairly compact group of people, and PPC HQ is smaller than a major city.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I wanted to participate here much sooner.<br><br>Okay, these two are ideas who have been boiling inside my brains for a while, and would like to write someday. So I&#39;ll be writing concepts rather than the elevator pitch. I&#39;ll be happy for any comment about them (including which one you prefer, of course).<br><br><br><br>First one is a fantasy one. The itch I have in mind for now is &#39;Magic has been used so recklessly it savaged the world. Nine mages pulled out a ritual to bind themselves to the nine (Life, Death, Light, Darkness, Fire , Water, Earth, Air and &#39;High Magic&#39;) different parts of the magic &#39;spectrum&#39; to stop it, becoming pretty much &#39;gods&#39; in the processus. And they&#39;ve to groom successors to take their place eventually, because the monitoring of this monumental energy? Not Good On Your Sanity&#39;.<br><br>Includes (of course) at least one of the group feeling not warm and fuzzy at the idea, up to using some sorts of soul-eating demons as an army to help with that disagreement, reincarnation as a feature of the world, not (exclusively) antagonistic use of undeads, desire to build and explore at length an entire world, with culture trying to avoid the &#39;nation of hats&#39; while eventually having nine major protagonists (the mentionned successors) eventually coming together to take care of the situation. <br><br>Including various actors out for their own gains, and said gods become gradually more unhinged, including cataclysms of &#39;wild magic&#39; when the control slips...<br><br><br><br>Number Two is a fantasy one too. It&#39;s one less developped, by here are the ideas I kept for now. A world stuck in a tug of war between the vile &#39;demons&#39; and their humans thralls and mankind, supported by the luminescent &#39;angels&#39;. Protagonist ends up in problems when he shows aptitude to the demon&#39;s brand of magic, rather than the humans&#39; elementarism or the holy magic taught by the angels, and something as a pretty surefire sign of demonic allegiance. Cue problems and story.<br><br>And eventually a nasty revelation: both demons and angels are pretty much eldritch veings waging a multi-worlds war, with the local planet being only one more battlefield, and none of them as a species (of course outliers exist) care about the local tools. <br><br>Even less because... Well, magic is pretty much an extension of the ecosystem as I see it in this setting, and while demons-controlled lands already look like the sort of wastelands they favor, the angels are crafty enough to use humans mages to soften the blow where their presence is the heaviest... Because Bleak Desert of Endless Still Order isn&#39;t that sexy of a presentation to the drafted locals liking crops of food and this sort of nice things. Meaning the big stakes become taking care of both sides of this war to make sure the humans can live their own destiny, and have a planet to live it.</p>

            <p>Talking about my WIPs while they&#39;re still WIPs is kind of anxiety-inducing for me. But it&#39;s always good to get feedback, so here goes.<br><br><b>The Orktili Invasion</b> (Working title)<br><br><i>The architecture in Pergamia had been specifically designed to hide the fact that people lived there from the eyes of hunting dragons. This is most likely the reason the Orktili chose it as a base of operations when they came from beyond the stars.</i><br><br>Sci-fi and fantasy happily married, as they were always meant to be. Aliens invade a magical country ruled by a power-hungry despot. It&#39;s up to her daughter, her banished younger brother, a peasant, and a pirate to figure out why they&#39;re here and how to get rid of them.<br><br><b>The Adventures of Laura Davidson</b> (Also a working title)<br><br><i>Laura Davidson learned her first swear word from the aspen tree across the street. Aspen Trees, as everyone knows, are foul-tempered things with no concern for Manners or Propriety or, indeed, for the Children, and as Luck would have it the only one in the neighborhood of Forthington Square was directly across the street from the house she grew up in.</i><br><br>Urban fantasy, inspired by all the tall tales my dad told me when I was a kid. Welcome to a world where it <i>is</i> possible to walk to school uphill both ways. Someone has sabotaged the Propellers that Make the Earth Go &#39;Round, but the only person who knows is seven-year-old Laura Davidson and no one believes her.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTnnitp7nyaYWwYkccF0xcZkAJOduYWDxKsagQFaSmCKmQ1w/viewform?usp=sf_link">And here&#39;s the form!</a><br><br>(Upon further reflection, it seems to me that I tend to be bad at naming things.

            <p>I&#39;m glad you like <i>The Adventures of Laura Davidson</i>. It&#39;s something of a recent idea, so it&#39;s not properly formed yet, so I&#39;m glad it&#39;s coming out coherent now.<br><br>As for sci-fi and fantasy, I&#39;ve seen good sci-fi with fantastic elements (Homestuck is a good example), and once or twice I&#39;ve run across a reasonably seamless meshing of the two. (The title escapes me but I read a book as a child about an interplanetary coalition that developed supernatural powers and used them to keep planets on a natural developmental path.) What I have never seen, however, is a solid fantasy base with sci-fi applied well to it. So naturally I set out to fill in the perceived gap in the fictional library.<br><br>What I&#39;m trying to say is I don&#39;t know if it can be done. I hope it can, but we&#39;ll just have to wait and see. In any event, I totally understand your reservation.</p>

            <p>So I made my 20k goal for my 2009 NaNo, but it doesn&#39;t have a title. It&#39;s the story of how the king&#39;s gadabout second son finds his calling as a military leader and saves the kingdom from invasion (yay!), but also gets stuck having to be king (boo!). Oh, and along the way he made a deal with a mysterious old man to put in a good word for him with the king in exchange for critical information about the invasion. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine.<br><br>This is a prequel to the main events.<br><br><i>There was a bee on the windowpane. It buzzed ineffectually against the green glass, apparently unconcerned with the distorted image of the world beyond; only drawn to the light.</i><br><br>Apparently I started a story in the main plot for a 2011 NaNo, but forgot about it. Seriously, when I opened the file, I thought it was going to be something else. I have no memory of writing the thing it actually is. It has a title, but it wouldn&#39;t be the book&#39;s title, so eh.<br><br><i>Snow swirled down from the heights of the mountain peaks, driving through the gaps between peak-roofed houses in the tiny village of Finleen huddled below and gathering in drifts against crosswise walls.  Through the dark, icy winter air, a baby&#39;s wail arose from one of the houses, cutting through the low moaning of pine trees in the wind.</i><br><br>(Dear god, that run-on. Ow.)<br><br>The something else isn&#39;t a novel. Probably it&#39;s a chapter in the same book as the 2011 thing. Again, there&#39;s a title, but not one I&#39;d actually be using. <i>Eh</i>.<br><br><i>The celebration of the Spring Equilux, which marked the end of winter and the beginning of the new year, was always an important event in the divided kingdoms of the north, and none prided themselves on their festival more than Wickham.</i><br><br>... I think I&#39;m bad at first lines. And titles.<br><br>All that stuff is in the same world, anyway. It&#39;s middleweight fantasy—there is magic, but it&#39;s not abundant; some fantasy creatures like elves, vampires, and dragons exist, but they&#39;re part of the natural world and obey meta-physiological rules. The Powers That Be are just another order of being (but some of them have big heads about it).<br><br>And I have no idea how it all fits together. Plot? <i>Hahahaha.</i> Ha.<br><br>A couple other ideas I&#39;ve toyed with, but haven&#39;t put any serious work into:<br><br><u>Moon magic</u><br><br>Modern fantasy. People are born with magic at various power levels according to location and phases of the four moons. Heather arrives in the right place at the right time to be the biggest magical deal in about two thousand years. As she comes into her power, all the major magical/political players want to control her, but she has to deal with the reccurrence of a major lunar alignment that spells big trouble for the world if she can&#39;t learn what she needs in time. Fortunately, there&#39;s an eccentric but endearing guy with a foreign accent who says he knows what&#39;s going on and can help! I&#39;m sure nothing bad will happen to him.<br><br><u>Supernatural SWAT team</u><br><br>What it says on the tin. Badass normal newbies Sophia Hue Phan and Tim Gurney join established team members Joe Donovan (a vampire) and Ban MacCormac (a werewolf); have to deal with witches, hackers, and confusing but steamy relationship polyhedrons. I dunno, I&#39;m pretty sure I just wanted to make up pretty people with cool names.<br><br>No vote, because seriously, there&#39;s nothing to vote on. I&#39;ll let you know if I actually work out a decent plot for any of these at any point.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Just a heads up, it&#39;s not gonna be a wide variety of genres. Or... ideas for that matter of fact.

            <p>I&#39;ve voted for <i>The Bone Man</i>, because it&#39;s a) least horrifying, and b) interesting! I also know Kaitlyn would like it.<br><br>I also find <i>IKB</i> interesting based on the summary - anything that&#39;s described as &#39;<i>Sophie&#39;s World</i> for...&#39; is going to catch my eye. :)<br><br>As for <i>The Words of the Voice</i>, I see (by way of Wikipedia) what you&#39;re getting at. The difference is that <i>The Words...</i> is presented as an actual body of ancient myth - just with a scientific basis. The oldest deities are incarnations of things like the expansion of the universe, gravity, light, chemical bonding and so forth. Later on we run into the more human-centric gods, at which point we drift away from science a bit and into sheer myth: there&#39;s not a lot of science in the extended adventures of Dyfais queen of Brenin, for all that she technically founds the Bronze Age.<br><br>Look, I <i>did</i> say it was weird.<br><br>hS</p>

G.U.A.R.D. stands for Guardians against Unseemly Atrocities and Relics Division. It&#39;s rather unwieldy, but it is what it says it is, and guarding is what they do, so I think it works (?).</p>

            <p>Truth be told I&#39;ve barely even started most of these projects, but I think they&#39;re the most likely to go anywhere if I ever actually apply myself to writing a proper novel. <br><br><b>The Bastion Walls</b><br><br><i>The sun beat down, the Walls rose up, and six sets of hoofbeats drummed out a canter on the red desert sands</i><br><br>Fantasy. A bright young dragoon captain, one of the few survivors of the Eight Bastion, must set musket ball and sabre against demon fangs and claws, and lead his men to safety.<br><br><b>The New London Paranatural Society</b><br><br><i>For the first time in forty years, Gregory Allen Fielding stood beneath a silver sun, and found nothing.</i><br><br>Urban Fantasy-ish. Just about every myth and monster exists, they just left. Their world&#39;s the High Road, our world&#39;s the Low Road, but you probably won&#39;t end up in Scotland if you follow that first one. Sort of like Van Helsing in the 1800s, only with harmonica rifles and Werewolves in waistcoats.<br><br><b>H.O.M.E. Away from Home</b><br><br><i>Something&#39;s following us, I&#39;m sure of it. I&#39;m going to prove it, I&#39;m going to catch it, and who knows, maybe this will finally convince my boss to give me a raise?</i><br><br>Soft sci-fi. A gunner on a rundown space station is sure she&#39;s spotted something moving in the dark, and she&#39;s fairly  certain human ships don&#39;t have quite so many tentacles.<br><br><b>The Bloody Harvest</b><br><br><s>I haven&#39;t actually got an opening line for this one shhhh </s><br><br>Fantasy, with some horror/mystery thrown in. A man seeking to marry science and magic moves to the village of Orchran Hills to pursue his craft in peace, but when he&#39;s framed for murder and black magic, he finds there may be more to the small town than he hoped.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Yx9MubIw9ohIbs8NxrGL4It_1TCBiImjLRH60L5prq4/prefill">Google Form </a><a></a> (I&#39;m not sure if this link actually works, I&#39;ve never used Google Forms before)<br><br><br>Now, as for your pitches, I was really torn between the first two. I like the sound of the Kraken-Knights setting, but The Next Great Wizard won out. It just seems like the kind of story that appeals to me. That &quot;Or is that just me?&quot; Bit at the end of the first line just grabbed me.<br><br>The Words of the Voice also sounds like an interesting concept, and holy hatstands do I love the first line for Gravity&#39;s Embrace. That is a hook and a half, sir. Well done. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you like them, The Bastion Walls especially, as it&#39;s sort of my flagship project. It&#39;s basically my love letter to military history and fiction wrapped up in fantasy trappings. A bit niche, perhaps, but it works for me. </p>

            <p>I checked <i>And It Goes All The Way Down</i>; that&#39;s a fantastic first line, and the concept is exciting.

            <p>Okay, I know, I had already said I was leaving long time ago, but at the same time it wasn&#39;t a properly &quot;final&quot; goodbye as I kept posting chapters of my spinoff&#39;s final story.<br><br>However, that&#39;s what I wanted to talk about. For those who don&#39;t know it, I&#39;ve decided to leave in the aftermath of some really nasty Board drama about one year ago, and I&#39;d leave it at that - especially since a person who doesn&#39;t want anything to do anymore with the PPC was involved.<br><br>I had hoped things would get better by the time I was done with Blank Sprite, but they didn&#39;t - every time I posted a new chapter, I would always find drama going on or drama would pop up right afterwards.<br><br>And, of course, that would drown out my releases. The last chapter of Blank Sprite just fell off the Board, with only one person commenting on it, and the other chapters didn&#39;t fare much better. And that despite the fact that I know the quality was there - I&#39;ve had very positive comments from my beta readers, most of them I believe are among the PPC&#39;s best (several being even Permission Givers or people who were nominated for the position).<br><br>It is disheartening. I&#39;ve started working on Blank Sprite around 2012 - that is a six years effort, a 77.000 words story (yup, enough for it to qualify as a novel) with possibly hundreds of hours spent working on it. I&#39;ve strived so much for quality that I even had an old time friend of mine, now working as a professional editor, have a look at it despite the fact that usually we didn&#39;t agree on writing matters, just for the sake of seeing if there was anything I could do better.<br>And this just for one comment for the final chapter while people were eager to throw themselves on the last &#39;bout of drama.<br><br>Okay, I now probably sound like a sour fanbrat, but that&#39;s something that saddens me. I did improve a lot as a writer while working on it, that&#39;s right, but was it any different than writing for the drawer at this point?<br><br>That is why I want to officially say that my PPC spinoffs are officially over. Not only the main Wings Of Canon one, but Keiko&#39;s spinoff as well - I&#39;ll update the pages accordingly.<br><br>While I had Keiko&#39;s fourth mission in the works, I&#39;m thinking finishing it might not be worth the time and effort if it is going to end up not being read as Blank Sprite was - I could be using that time and effort for my book instead.<br><br>And... yes. I&#39;m working on a fully original book of mine. The plot and characters will be loosely based on that of Blank Sprite (can&#39;t let all that work go to waste, right?), but otherwise it will be a new story. It won&#39;t have, for obvious reasons, &quot;Sergio Turbo&quot; on the cover, but if any of you will ever get it in their hands and read it they will probably notice.<br><br>So... that&#39;s it, pretty much. Goodbye guys and gals, it has been an honor but this place isn&#39;t working for me anymore. I wish all the best for the community, as I&#39;m saddened to see a lot of drama going on - that is not the PPC I knew, and I hope it will be back to the way it was.<br><br>(Okay, I&#39;ll technically stay around a few days more to read some answers. But not for long. Once this thread falls off the first place, I&#39;ll be gone from here)</p>

            <p>I was a bit dubious to start with - <i>Blank Sprite</i> is way outside my usual canons - but the story does a good job of filling me in on what&#39;s going on. It provides just enough information about the canons to support the story, without going into an encyclopaedia article.<br><br>Actually, the place where the description gets a bit overwrought is the agents. Lines like Nikki&#39;s response to Anne about the Vanguard:<br><br><i>“Yes. It works really well, and my magic stopped changing randomly[...] well, I still became a mermaid a couple of times while I was bathing, but I think you did a great job anyway!”</i><br><br>... have a bit too much of an &#39;as you know, Bob&#39; feel to them at times. Something of the kind was necessary, I think, but possibly not this blatantly.<br><br>The story itself is good, and I like the way it&#39;s slowly unfolding. We start on a mission, then slip into something that sounds like a Jurisfiction story - and then the Factories rear their head. It all builds up quite neatly, and hints at more to come.<br><br>(Yes, there will probably be 15 separate review posts; I&#39;m sneaking this in between pieces of work.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This chapter starts out light and easy - too easy. The fact that Sergio and Nikki are able to get exactly what they&#39;re looking for sets off all sorts of alarm bells (and it&#39;s good to see that the agents are genre-savvy enough to pick up on that!).<br><br>And then... action sequence! I think this was really well-written, and I say that as someone who has great difficulty writing action. :) It serves to increase the dissonance between the idea that the Factories are behind this, and the actual events we&#39;re seeing. I&#39;m glad I saved this all to read at once, because I&#39;d <i>hate</i> to get caught in cliffhangers down the line.<br><br>You also continue to build the background suspense over what the heck is up with Sergio&#39;s history. I&#39;m really looking forward to getting that one answered. :)<br><br>Favourite line: “… <i>We</i> are being shipped by <i>canons</i>?&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Once again, I feel like I&#39;m in a stealth Jurisfiction crossover - and that&#39;s not a bad thing! New ways of looking at the multiverse are always welcome.<br><br>Interestingly, for all that this is a very action-packed chapter, it feels much more personal. This chapter is very much focussed on Sergio&#39;s strangeness; we see it through pretty much everyone&#39;s eyes. The equally strange goings-on (and do I feel a time loop forming?) take second place, and the action, for all that it&#39;s well-written, comes in third. It&#39;s a well-written chapter, with good storytelling technique.<br><br>Favourite line: <i>What was she? A fairy with an Internet connection?</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay, the navigational mishap made me smile. ^_^<br><br>I&#39;m constantly appreciative of the details from PPC history you bring into this story. NASTY may only be a footnote to the tale, but they&#39;re something that Corolla <i>should</i> have turned up, so I&#39;m pleased that she did.<br><br>Some of the emotions in the latter half of this chapter don&#39;t ring quite true with me, but partly that could simply be that I don&#39;t know the canon characters.

            <p>In my head I have this pegged as The Flashback Episode, and because of that I&#39;ve got half an eye open for Chekhovs. I&#39;m assuming on general principles that every single person mentioned is going to come back up; that&#39;s just how this sort of thing goes. ^_^<br><br>Sergio talks at times here like he&#39;s regurgitating a prologue, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s accidental. It makes perfect sense to me that a character telling their own backstory would drift into a more narrative tone; it&#39;s a mild case of Tom Bombadil way back in <i>Suedom</i>, who could only speak in his canonical lines.<br><br>I deeply appreciate the girls&#39; eminently sensible behaviour - when confronted with a question that could be answered by a CAD, Nikki goes right to pulling out a CAD, and when there are questions outstanding, Corolla does the research and forms a viable theory. There&#39;s no plot-forced artificial stupidity here.<br><br>Favourite line: <i>[We kinda have a bigger problem to deal with here, and angsting won’t solve anything.

            <p>Chapter 5 was the one I had the most doubts with - it is basically Sergio&#39;s backstory narrated by him in a single sitting so I was afraid it could be too infodumpy. I&#39;m happy this is not the case.<br><br>And yes, I believe Corolla is my best character, too.</p>

I like the fact that the agents clearly show their affection for the various canons, <i>without</i> descending into fangirling of the sort shown by even Jay and Acacia. It fits their characters nicely.<br><br>I also like how Nikki&#39;s feelings for Sergio come across, particularly in her conversation with Homura. It helps that she&#39;s right in what she says, of course.<br><br>... and then the plot - the <i>real</i> plot, the one about &#39;what in the worlds is going on with Sergio&#39; - kicks into high gear. In true traditional fashion, I have little to say about this part, because I&#39;m too busy reading it. ^_^ I absolutely <i>love</i> the way you framed the middle of this chapter, though. And the ending... gulp!<br><br>Favourite line:<br><br><i>[Time wasn’t supposed to elapse in your world afterward in relation to the PPC’s standard time. Or something. Multidimensional physics are kinda confusing.]<br><br>“… I’m still trying to understand that I’m a fictional character whose life is written by someone else, actually,” Homura admitted.<br><br>“Well, as of now, nobody is writing us,” Nikki reassured her.<br><br>“You sure, Nikki?” Sergio asked. “Maybe that 14 year-old idiot who wrote me back in 2006 is still at it.”</i><br><br>This sort of thing perfectly bottles all four characters and their relations to each other.

            <p>&quot;Guido Piano&quot;. XD<br><br>Did... did Sergio just get attacked by a flashback?

            <p>It really saddens me that you&#39;re leaving this place for good (and while I&#39;m using it, and had RPs, RPGs and other things on it, when I look at the drama it spawned and Boarders it made leave... Is Discord worth it?)...<br><br>Sorry for not reacting more about Blank Sprite (And I was feeling similar feelings when I posted my missions... Pot? Kettle called. He said you&#39;re black.). I&#39;ve been reading the whole story, and fully intends to post a C&amp;C of the final chapter on the site... but Real Life has been getting busy with job searching lately (Welp, eight monthes of being jobless, but things quickened up in June), and I have at least three other C&amp;C for other stories I&#39;ve been following are on the backburner too. And I&#39;ll join your beta-readers, the story is an excellent one.<br><br>And I&#39;d very much want to read Teiko&#39;s fourth lission myself. And I&#39;m sure other on this Board would want to.<br><br>I&#39;ll also gladly read that original book, and would really hope I won&#39;t miss when it&#39;s published.<br><br>Duck I hated when the goodbyes began when you left, I hate them as much now. Still, good luck for the future.<br><br><br><br>P.S.: For the drama... Really? I know I tend to avoid it when it seems like boiling, but every time... I hoped te situation was getting better.</p>

            <p>Though I&#39;m kinda puzzled by how you keep calling Keiko &quot;Teiko&quot;...<br><br>Anyways, since you seem to also like Josh as a character, I shall point you to where he&#39;s from:<br><br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/560180/"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/560180/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/560180/</a></a><br><br>Yup, he&#39;s a canon character. With a catch: the one featured in Blank Sprite is an alternate universe version authorized (and checked before publishing) by the game&#39;s developer himself, as we&#39;ve been friends for a while.<br><br>The proof? Once you reach a certain level, you&#39;re forced to use the extended roster characters instead of the main team. Scroll down to Stubborn Mongoose, I bet he&#39;ll be very familiar...</p>

            <p>Ixion and Dia<br><br>Ixion was a son of Phlegyas the Lapith king, and of his wife who no-one bothered to name. Typical, isn&#39;t it? Anyway, Ixion agreed to marry Dia, daughter of Eioneus, promising rich bridal gifts and inviting Eioneus to a banquet. You&#39;ll note that he didn&#39;t invite <i>Dia</i>, or even speak to her. Again - typical.<br><br>Of course, it turned out that Ixion had no intention of paying the bribe he was offering Dia&#39;s dad. He set a pitfall in front of his palace, with a great charcoal fire underneath, into which the unsuspecting Eioneus fell and was burned.<br><br>(The gods, of course, receive sacrifices through burning; I have it on good authority that a certain someone whose name rhymes with Blapollo was heartily sick after sniffing this one.)<br><br>Though every woman on Olympos thought this a heinous deed, and refused to purify Ixion, Zeus, having &#39;behaved equally ill himself when in love&#39; (yes, that&#39;s an actual quote; <i>some</i> of these mythtellers are on my side), not only purified the wretch but brought him to eat at his table.<br><br>I - sorry, Hera, the divine Queen of Heaven, absolutely refused to share a meal with that beast. Luckily, she had Nephele, a cloud-form that she used for... certain... recreational purposes; it was a simple matter to transform it to look like herself, and send it to the meal in her stead.<br><br>The Queen then paid a visit to poor Dia. With her father dead, and her husband an outlawed, abusive sociopath, she was in sore need of comfort, and Hera was happy to oblige.<br><br>Things were going exceedingly well, when suddenly there was a clattering of hooves. Barely had Hera hidden herself behind a pillar when a horse cantered in, twenty hands tall, crowned with lightning, and very <i>obviously</i> a stallion, if you take my meaning. Poor Dia was caught entirely unprepared, and, well, there are none who can stand between Zeus the Thunderer and his desires.<br><br>Yes, Zeus, realising that Ixion&#39;s presence on Olympos had left his beautiful wife alone, had sculpted his own, inferior cloud-form and snuck down to the mortal realm to have his way with her. I know the Zeus-cloud was inferior, because a <i>quality</i> cloud-image would never have allowed what happened at the high table.<br><br>Ixion, obviously, was utterly ungrateful of his undeserved honours, and planned to seduce Hera. Being completely without a functioning brain, he did this with only the barest attempt at subtlety, and there was no-one in the great temple who didn&#39;t know what was going on.<br><br>Yes, they all allowed this mortal to outright assault the Queen of Heaven, and yes, <i>very harsh words</i> were had on my - sorry, her - return. The cloud Nephele was built to be receptive to such advances, but <i>someone</i> should have done something. Not least any properly-designed Zeus-cloud - you&#39;d think &#39;protect my wife&#39; would be priority number one!<br><br>Zeus returned midway through the disgraceful ocurrance, leaving poor Dia an utter emotional wreck. Luckily she had a kind goddess to hand to offer her comfort... meanwhile, Zeus surprised Ixion in the very act of his defilement, and promptly claimed that it had all been part of his master plan. It&#39;s amazing how often he does that.<br><br>The Thunderer ordered Hermes to scourge the mortal mercilessly, and then bind him to a fiery wheel which rolled ceaselessly through the sky thereafter, which frankly was better than he deserved. Poor Nephele was banished to earth before Hera could get back; she bore him a child by the name of Centaurus, who was ultimately the father of Chiron. Then she married a king, got thrown over for a maenad, ended up running a taxi service with flying golden sheep... look, it was all a bit of a mess.<br><br>As for Dia? Unlike her fickle husband, Hera is <i>always</i> faithful to her lovers. Once everything had blown over, and Dia had found someone to look after her son by Zeus, Pirithous (lovely boy, not very lucky though), the merciful and just Queen of Heaven spirited her away to the courts of Olympos. A little light cosmetic surgery, and she passed for one of the many nymphs who populate the place. No-one would take the slightest notice of just another nymph heading towards Hera&#39;s private quarters... ahem.<br><br>((With sincere apologies to Robert Graves, author of <i>The Greek Myths</i>, whose text has been thoroughly mangled for this purpose. ~hS))</p>

            <p>I would give Thomas Bulfinch&#39;s &quot;Mythology&quot; and Edith Hamilton&#39;s &quot;Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; a try, though the latter has Heracles-Bashing. It casts him as a big, dumb, brute, even though he demonstrated cleverness on many occasions.</p>

            <p>is D&#39;Aulaire&#39;s Greek Myths. It has really wonderful pictures, and covers a lot of the stories. It glosses over a lot of the more messed up sexual stuff to make it kid friendly, although it did include the guy mating with a cloud to somehow produce centaurs, so clearly didn&#39;t skip over all of it. <br><br>My youngest kid&#39;s school program introduces the book as a read aloud with flashcards of the important bits in 3rd grade and then again in 4th with more writing involved. My kid is spelling challenged, so no idea how I am going get him spelling things like Hephaestus this next year. <br><br>They sell it in paperback, but it&#39;s one I&#39;d recommend getting in hard cover, it&#39;s a keeper. They have a D&#39;Aulaire&#39;s Norse Myths, too. <br><br>My oldest second&#39;s Bulfinch&#39;s for more mature readers.</p>

            <p>[Twisthalia has now entered roast mode.]<br><br>Ahem.<br><br>First of all, I read that to punish Leto, you prolonged her pregnancy to nine months. Reading between the lines, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s how the average pregnancy came to be nine months in the first place. How petty is a goddess who does something to punish one woman and ends up harming every woman in the process? Why don&#39;t you think before you revenge for once?<br><br>Second of all, speaking of Hephaestus, the poor guy! You threw him off Olympus either for his face or his limp, based on different accounts. I&#39;m pretty sure it was his face. So hey, you&#39;re superficial, but at least you&#39;re not ableist, am I right? Either way, get with the times.<br><br>Third of all... all the things you did to Hercules and his mom. Delayed birth, the snakes, the insanity, the twelve labors. Do you deserve to be on this Board if you yourself are prone to... going to such lengths to smite your enemies? I mean, we are deities (some greater than others), but there&#39;s a right way and a wrong way to do deity stuff, and you seem like you&#39;re trying kinda hard to fulfill your wishes.

            <p>&#39;First of all&#39;, to quote you, Leto deserved everything she got; or do you think attempting to steal my husband and my throne was just a light-hearted jape? Secondly, she only gave birth <i>at all</i> due to finding loopholes in my decrees; the &#39;nine months&#39; thing was a fluke that should never have happened.<br><br>Thirdly, the fact that a trio of deities (Zeus, Neshthena, and Hephaestus) who never knew their mothers simply assumed that nine months was a good length for a pregnancy is <i>hardly</i> my fault; had my husband only <i>asked</i> before ordaining the creation of Pandora (and if you want to talk about mistreatment of women, look at <i>that</i>!), I could have set him straight. But he didn&#39;t.<br><br>I&#39;m not even going to address your scurrilous accusations regarding Hephaestus. But as for little Alcides - who does <i>not</i> deserve to use my name, thank you very much - he was a brat from birth (why do you think I tried to stop it?). He attempted to maul me as an <i>infant</i>, but did I retaliate? No! I let Athene take him away in peace, because of my overwhelming kindness.<br><br>To find that Alcmene promptly renamed him after me to celebrate her petty victory, and then immediately accused me of trying to murder him with snakes (snakes! Why would I send snakes?) was the biggest slap in the face you can imagine. <br><br>As for blaming his wretched violence on me, I&#39;m sorry, but do you not even <i>remember</i> the way he slaughtered your nephew Linus? The boy was clearly wrong in the head, and he only proved that when he murdered poor Megara. Nor did the Labours have anything to do with me; he was set to them by the Oracle at... Delphi... wait a minute.<br><br>Serpents are the followers of Hermes, son of Zeus and that fallen star Maia. Madness is the blessing of Dionysus, son of Zeus and Semele. Delphi is the domain of Apollo, son of Zeus and Leto.<br><br>... my Me. The whole wretched &#39;Heracles&#39; affair was a plot by my husband&#39;s sons to discredit me. I bet Neshthena was in on it too! They&#39;re out to get me, the lot of them!<br><br>No... no. Calm down, Herasoron. Everything is fine. Your husband loves you. Your handmaids love you.

            <p>I&#39;ve always been one to trust in the advice to write for yourself rather than for others, but even so it&#39;s become disturbingly common nowadays for more than a few Boarders to have devoted days or even weeks of effort to writing, proofreading, and the complex business of beta-reading, post the final product on the Board in the hopes of receiving reader compliments and feedback, and be met with utter silence while everyone else pays far more attention to other Boarders, events, or things. It&#39;s happened several times in my case as well, much to my chagrin, and although I have yet to have my writing inadvertently upstaged by drama I&#39;ll gladly second Tomash&#39;s sentiment regarding this issue. Reader critique is essential for writers to move forward and failing to provide it may result in the risk of stagnation on the author&#39;s part and a decline in work quality - something I myself know from experience over the past few years as a PPC writer.<br><br>And as for the whole deal with consistent drama, this was the reason for my (admittedly misguided and poorly worded) statement that I was disappointed with the community in the aftermath of a former member leaving and requesting to be locked out as penance for attacking the Board on behalf of someone who was banned twice in a row. For all intents and purposes, consider that statement retracted. I came to the PPC because I thought it to be drama-free unlike certain communities I had left behind (or was kicked out of) over the years, and I&#39;ve made a lot of great friends thanks to it; in hindsight I should&#39;ve known that the Ironic Overpower was already setting its sights on my naivete regarding the dearth of drama at the time. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=316568;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">As Neshomeh put it</a>, though, &quot;neither [the banned person] nor any other individual has the power to ruin the PPC unless we give it to them by losing our cool over them.&quot; I know there have been quite a few slip-ups over the years - some worse than others, as Sergio noted - but from what I&#39;ve been seeing, The Nameless Admin has done a good job dealing with most of the things that troubled us since. I guess my earlier bitterness was due to a combination of singling out the drama without considering the good things this community has to offer and sealing myself in a mental panic room whenever I see things going south (which is a very real bad habit my family has been helping me to break!).<br><br>While I did consider leaving myself not long after the incident Sergio mentioned, I quickly decided against it in part because I still have obligations regarding my PPC characters in the future. I will however repeat my assent with regards to Tomash - in no small part because I too know all too well the feeling of months of hard work being rendered absolutely useless.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve noticed here that, as a general trend, a decent chunk of the writing on the Board (for example, Ix and Delta&#39;s recent mission) hasn&#39;t really gotten much of a response. So, I&#39;d like to ask: why aren&#39;t people leaving more responses?<br><br>For my part, I&#39;ve run into cases where I really don&#39;t have the time to read some longer work until it&#39;s fallen off the front page and responding seemed silly or I&#39;d ended up giving up on actually getting around to reading the thing. (There&#39;s also the case, like with Delta and Ix&#39;s mission, where I was a beta reader, which means I&#39;d already left my comments and repeating them again felt rather redundant.)<br><br>My current hypothesis is that a noticeable part of the problem comes from the community is drifting older and real-life-having-er (due to a slowdown in the number of newbies because we&#39;re hiding off in a near-invisible corner of the internet) which has left us collectively with less time to read stuff.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I&#39;m on a bus, though, so I&#39;ll keep to this bit for now.<br><br>Why I personally may not review:<br><br>Sometimes I may feel I have nothing constructive to add (and we did go through a period of people complaining against one-line &quot;this was good!&quot; type comments, IIRC), but it&#39;s usually because I didn&#39;t read it.<br><br>Why didn&#39;t I read it:<br><br>- As hS says, as an adult, the time and energy commitment is costlier to me than it was when I was in college. If I have a choice between devoting my free time to reading and reviewing a mission or something else, the mission has to be more rewarding than the other thing.<br><br>- To be blunt, it usually isn&#39;t. It&#39;s nothing personal. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve been a PPCer for fifteen years; I&#39;ve read a LOT of missions. It takes more to get my attention these days, even if it&#39;s in a continuum I know and by a writer I like.<br><br>I&#39;d like to stress that I don&#39;t think this means the writing quality has dropped off (how would I know?) or that the community has changed for the worse (more thoughts on &quot;drama&quot; another time). Mostly, it&#39;s that <i>I</i> have changed. I&#39;m at a radically different place in my life than most of the rest of you. That&#39;s no one&#39;s fault, and nothing to panic over.<br><br>- I may not care for the continuum or the style of the writer. We all have our preferences.<br><br>Now, let me answer the corollary of why I <i>may</i> read and review:<br><br>- As an older, more experienced member, it&#39;s something I expect of myself. Occasionally this feels burdensome, but I figure if I&#39;m going to hang around with you kids, I should at least occasionally make an effort to embrace my adulthood and the position of mentor.<br><br>- As an older, more experienced member, I DO often have thoughts to contribute that others may not. Sharing my expertise with someone who values it is rewarding for me.<br><br>- If I like you and have a good relationship with you, I&#39;m way more likely to read and comment on your stuff. I know I personally don&#39;t make it too easy to get to know me, though, so I don&#39;t fault anyone else on this point. More on community another time.<br><br>- If you engage with my writing/other output, I&#39;m more likely to engage with yours. More on the social contract another time.<br><br>I think that&#39;s all the major points? Again, though, on a bus. I may have missed things.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I pretty much reply to anything I read - I just don&#39;t read anything. It&#39;s a combination of a number of factors:<br><br>-I don&#39;t have much extended &#39;free time&#39; on the computer, and what I do have (at home), I use for other things (ie, games).<br><br>-I don&#39;t like reading long things on a phone.<br><br>-Missions today are much, much longer than they used to be.<br><br>-I don&#39;t know most of the canons people are working in these days; relatedly, the habit of mentioning what canon a mission is in in the subject line has been lost, so the ones I do know are hidden away.<br><br>-I don&#39;t know the agents, and most stories nowadays are built around the assumption that you do. The first part springs out of all the foregoing, but it&#39;s a definite vicious cycle: I don&#39;t know the agents, so I can&#39;t get into the missions, so I don&#39;t get to know the agents...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Some interesting points. Interesting points which make me want to take some of that into account with the next thing I write! Unfortunately, I write/publish somewhat slowly, so I&#39;m not sure how immediately effective that could be, but...I&#39;ll still keep it in mind. Especially the last two points. And hopefully I *will* be posting some things soonish. Maybe. Hopefully. End of semester is a poor time to be saying that, but I&#39;m a daredevil today.<br><br>In terms of making the agents accessible: any tips on how to do that gently? I immediately think a bit of how JKR reintroduces characters at the beginning of each book, but possibly done more simply? For instance, kind of weaving in bits of information near the beginning, but not pausing to recap a little?<br><br>Come to think of it, Tamora Pierce does this as well...actually, if I pick up the first book of hers within reach, <i>Briar&#39;s Book</i> (fourth in a series), this is what I get in the first chapter:<br><br>-Briar himself, the third person POV character for this chapter, gets reintroduced bit by bit as the plot starts up. Little bits of his past and his present, what he&#39;s learning, who he is, how he acts in different situations--it gets presented through mentions, comparisons, even dialogue with other characters (including one who&#39;s never met him before, but has a very good reason for doing so). We get a good sense of who he is and where he&#39;s been (and currently is) in life without the author ever really stopping for a couple paragraphs to throw the information at us. Everything is just woven in, in a way that doesn&#39;t really seem forced--just a tiny bit introspective, if that.<br><br>-Briar&#39;s adoptive sisters and their teachers mostly just get establishing details of their names and what they do in life, though to be fair, they&#39;re not in this chapter at all. Only Sandry appears: accordingly, we get little notes on her personality, which, considering that they inform Briar&#39;s responses to her, fit in very well.<br><br>-Briar&#39;s teacher, Rosethorn, gets a lot more, which makes sense since she&#39;s quite present in the chapter. We first get her name and occupation, in the context of Briar&#39;s thoughts to do with why they&#39;re in the city at all. In the same paragraph, we find out a little bit about her strength of will, still in the same context. On the next page, we get a physical description <i>and</i> Briar&#39;s past reaction to it--which help establish her further, both because (though it&#39;s not mentioned now) Rosethorn is a bit vain about her face and because Briar&#39;s reaction does actually reflect on her personality. We also get a brief mention of her power and what she&#39;s actually teaching Briar. A few pages later, we get another establishing detail or two about her in connection with Briar, before she reappears in person. Then we get only one or two more establishing hints, still in the context of Briar&#39;s thoughts.<br><br>And I know it&#39;s the next chapter, but I want to mention that that one starts off reintroducing a recurring secondary character through the eyes of his niece (Sandry). It also introduces Sandry. In the first three paragraphs, we get a good bit of physical description (and a bit of recent history) in a way that makes <i>sense</i>. We open with them having tea and being pleased to see each other, continue with a mention that it&#39;s been a hard winter in the time elapsed since the last book, and flow into the second paragraph with Sandry reflecting on how that winter affected her uncle (using physical description to also show emotional state) and seguing very naturally from there into briefly describing why he dresses simply, which says a good deal about both his personality and his strength as a ruler. In the third paragraph, we get physical description of Sandry, with hints of personal description, in the context of her having dressed up on purpose.<br><br>And I&#39;m going to cut myself off here, because as fun as it is to go on analyzing, there are at least three more characters to talk about, and this will just become essay length.<br><br>My point with all this? This is the fourth book in a series, with nine characters to reintroduce within the first couple chapters, not to mention bits of the setting. Looking at it, I think her methods actually could be adapted well to missions, though they might have to be shortened--though, then again, most missions don&#39;t involve eight or more agents! I think weaving in descriptions could be done, though it might take some practice and editing to make sure it flows logically. A nice little challenge! I&#39;m going to try to take it.<br><br>Any further ideas?<br><br>--<br><br>Reintroducing agents more might also help with my own reasons for not reading all the recent missions. Those primarily boil down to:<br><br>-I don&#39;t know the canon, and if the agents didn&#39;t start off in ones I did know, and at a time when I had free time to read missions, I&#39;m usually not going to follow them in. Unless the summary *really* grabs me, but with a canon I don&#39;t know...that can be hard.<br><br>As for what happened with Blank Sprite...I think I was actually a beta early on? The problem is: canon I don&#39;t know, characters I don&#39;t feel I know too well yet...the latest summaries were interesting, and more and more I&#39;m thinking I might go back and read it from the beginning, but--that&#39;s the thing. When part 12 is going up, at a busy time, going back to the beginning unfortunately becomes a bit daunting, especially if you&#39;re unfamiliar with most of what&#39;s involved. However, given I&#39;m pretty sure some of my favorite tropes showed up by the end, I may have to go back and give it a proper go. It&#39;s an impressive piece of work, and I&#39;ve been both glad and impressed to watch the parts keep going up, even if I wasn&#39;t reading at the time.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>To take a specific example: Blank Sprite is perfectly enjoyable. I remember only the vaguest things about the agents, know nothing about the canons, but I&#39;ve read three chapters so far and will be moving onto the fourth when I&#39;ve stopped replying to things on the Board. ^_~ The problem has never been that I start reading and go &#39;uggh, who are all these people?&#39; - it&#39;s that I never start reading at all.<br><br>And partly that&#39;s length. When I wrote the <i>Woodsprite of the North</i> mission, it was ridiculously long, clocking in at around 11,500 words. Terri&#39;s note at the top of it describes it as &#39;one of the more epic DOGA missions&#39;.<br><br>Well, <i>Of Wolves and Fellowship</i> (my most recent full-length &#39;real&#39; mission) is only 3000 words shy of that. Ix and Delta&#39;s mission at the bottom of the front page is 2000 more than it. Compare that to TOS, where around 5000 words is fairly normal. Missions have been getting longer - and I&#39;ve been getting lazier.<br><br>And partly it&#39;s lack of connection. Back In The Day, I talked to loads of Boarders on MSN Messenger; I was friends with them on LJ. When Gundamkiwi wrote a mission, I didn&#39;t go &#39;oh, anime, skip&#39; - I went &#39;hey, it&#39;s Kiwi!&#39;. Now, even the people I know best on the Board, I only interact with here or in occasional emails. I know, other options are still out there, but I have my own issues with those - not least of which is time.<br><br>And partly, yeah, it&#39;s time. I used to read every mission that came through, because I was a university student with loads of downtime and no friends. Now, I&#39;m at work all day, spending time with my wife in the evenings, and entertaining small children at the weekends. Whether it&#39;s 5K or 15K, I don&#39;t have the time to settle down with a mission I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m going to enjoy. (Most books I read nowadays are ones I&#39;ve already read, too. I&#39;m working through the latter Discworld novels at the moment, among other things.)<br><br>What can a writer do to counter that? <i>I don&#39;t know</i>. I&#39;ve tried various things myself - short missions is my big one - but they didn&#39;t have a huge impact. Too many confounding factors. I don&#39;t know.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Because of our tendency to roll our own mission hosting, and double especially because a lot of stuff has moved to Google Docs, there&#39;s no good or uniform ways to leave a review (or even some sort of &quot;I like this&quot;) on things that have fallen off the front page or that are sitting on the wiki, such as, say <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1TTjD03ZS0IMof0YvtoC1Sn3863vtxyFZhyNct-Qihb0">this Young Wizards mission by hS</a> (thoughts: the chocolate scene at the beginning was funny, &quot;only when so inclined&quot; and surrounding was a nice bit of dialogue, the execution method was clever).<br><br>Does anyone have any suggestions here?

            <p>I love Google  Docs. That&#39;s where I do all my writing. Which is probably why I hate reading finished works in Google Docs. I always have a nagging feeling that the work isn&#39;t complete when I am reading it there. It&#39;s probably just a weird thing specific to me, but just throwing that out there. <br><br>The main thing, though, is that I was gone for a long time and it&#39;s like a foreign country to me now. I don&#39;t know many of the people, and fewer of the agents, and I&#39;m reluctant to go back and start at the beginning to learn the agents, especially if I have no knowledge of the canons.</p>

            <p>(... which is a brilliantly nonspecific answer; <i>everything</i> is a combination of lots of factors.)<br><br>Thinking back to the old days on FF.net, there was a lot of subtle emphasis on reviews:<br><br>-On the category page and on the story itself, you had the number of previous reviews front and centre, with a link to let you read them. They weren&#39;t just for the author - they were for other readers, too.<br><br>-You had a big empty text box at the bottom of the page, inviting you to write in it.<br><br>-Chapter length limits meant you saw a <i>lot</i> of those text boxes. You&#39;d probably split a big, modern mission over three or four chapters, whereas on GDocs or a website, it&#39;s all one huge column of words.<br><br>-&quot;Please R&amp;R!&quot; &quot;Reviews are very welcome.&quot; &quot;If I get five reviews of this chapter, I&#39;ll continue!&quot; &quot;If you review my story, I&#39;ll review yours!&quot; These things come across as shallow attention-seeking, and we love to mock them... but they also work.<br><br>We don&#39;t have that. Even your user page is hidden away behind a link; it&#39;s not <i>there</i>, in your face. And the lack of ability to review elsewhere (and the fact that we&#39;ve drifted away from being a community of fanfic writers and readers) means people have lost the... the cultural imperative to do so.<br><br>... hmm. This gives me an idea.<br><br>hS, splitting off for a new post</p>

            <p>At this point, I&#39;ve mostly resigned myself to the fact that all of my published missions and interludes might as well be writing for the drawer. Length of missions doesn&#39;t have anything to do with it; while my cowrites tend to be rather... on the long side (to put it lightly), my average mission is about 20 pages in a Google Doc, or 8k words. I&#39;ll get one, maybe two comments on any of them if I&#39;m lucky.<br><br>The only thing people turn out to read these days are the bigger event pieces.

I can&#39;t remember the last time I bothered to read a mission that wasn&#39;t by an author whose agents I didn&#39;t already know. <br><br>Confession time: it&#39;s because I&#39;m petty. If nobody&#39;s reading my missions, why should I bother to do the same?</p>

            <p>So the way I see it, there are a few common obstacles to missions. Here they are, itemized. I&#39;ll also try and propose some solutions or something.<br><br>1. Mission Length: Missions have been getting longer, yeah. Go reread the Blood Raining Night mission again, and at the front, Past!Nesh talks about how 30 pages is HUUUGE for a mission. Nowadays, that&#39;s... pretty average, I think. No real easy fix for that.<br><br>2. The Comicbook Problem: As you write more missions, continuity piles up, making the whole thing increasingly inpenetrable to newcomers. A lot of spinoffs get bitten by this, but I think Ix gets it the worst: Ix&#39;s spinoffs are really long, but also have a strong character drama focus, with an overarching arc of character development throughout. As such, if you don&#39;t read them all, you find yourself at a disadvantage because you&#39;re missing stuff—at least, that&#39;s the impression I&#39;ve gotten, part of why I haven&#39;t gotten into them yet. Let me know if I&#39;m wrong.<br><br>There are a few ways to deal with this:<br><br>-Don&#39;t build strong continuity: If you don&#39;t have a strong arc and character development focus, this isn&#39;t so bad for you. Trojie and Pads are a great example of this: that spinoff has a ton of missions, but you can pretty much read whatever you want, and most of them can more or less stand alone. Larf described the spinoff as &quot;like a Saturday-morning cartoon&quot; once, and I think he nailed it. A lot of early spinoffs also did this, as the emphasis was more on the snark and goofiness than the characters in the early days, but they were short enough that it didn&#39;t really matter.<br><br>-The &quot;Cosmere&quot; Approach: Dubbed as such after Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Cosmere. Sayeth TVTropes, Sanderson created the Cosmere because he &quot;desire to create an epic length series without requiring readers to buy a ridiculous amount of books.&quot; But TVT isn&#39;t the most accurate source, I can&#39;t be sure that&#39;s true. Anyways he interlinked a ton of shorter series that all stood on their own into a larger, overarching universe. That way, newcomers had a wide variety of entry points, each series was short enough not to overwhelm, and you still got the benefits of a larger, more elaborate setting if you were willing to read all the things. In the PPC, the strongest example of this sort of thing is by far hS. hS&#39;s spinoff stuff is big. Really big. There is quite a bit of it. But see, it never feels big, because it&#39;s split up into a large number of interconnected series that can be, more or less, read in any order, each with satisfying character arcs (well, most of them, anyways. The arc-centric ones). I first started reading with Lofty Skies, Crashing Down, Not the DIO, Swan&#39;s Egg, and Tales from DoGA. But had I gone through Newbies, Origins, Wanderer, DWT, and Elsewhere In Action, I would have been just as able to comprehend things. This is a massive strength, and a credit to hS&#39;s writing. It&#39;s also a credit that he uses the large cast he has to make the PPC feel really alive and active, and to keep the goofiness of the PPC alive while he actually does genuinely serious character arcs. But enough stroking hS&#39;s ego. He doesn&#39;t need it.<br><br>-Not writing many missions: This is the simple approach: you don&#39;t have to manage complexity if you never create it. Although it has its own problems, of course. Many PPCers use this strategy. Like me! (but I&#39;m working on it.)<br><br>3. The Canons-you-don&#39;t-know problem: I&#39;ll be honest... I don&#39;t see this as a problem so much. I mean, it is slightly, but it&#39;s not disasterous. The first trick is ensuring that people who don&#39;t know the canon don&#39;t get lost, which... I am notoriously bad at. Heck, I failed to get my Permission first time around for a large part because I didn&#39;t give proper context for my characters and most of my betas knew them already such that they couldn&#39;t catch the issue ahead of time. Massive failing on my part. So... if you want your mission to be decipherable to people who don&#39;t know the canon, get betas who don&#39;t know the canon, and get them to tell you when they&#39;re confused.<br><br>The other trick is holding the uninitiated reader&#39;s interest. This is really a test of your abilities as a writer, and of the strength of your agents. Because in the absence of canon knowledge, the horror of the fic&#39;s crimes against that canon aren&#39;t as strong a draw, nor is the joy of seeing all those bad tropes you see in your ff.net browsings day after day getting ripped into. So what remains is the strength of the characters and their interactions (and their snark—this is the PPC after all), which really ought to be the central focus anyways. We may be critics, but the primary focus of a PPC mission is to entertain.<br><br>Part of the reason this has never been so much a probkem is because reading fics in canons I don&#39;t know well or don&#39;t care about was a big part of my PPC experience. I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;d read LoTR when I first stumbled across TOS, and even if I had, I was mocked at the time for not knowing the difference between Barad-dur and Khazad-dun. I wasn&#39;t a dedicated Rings fan, but I devoured TOS and OFUM, because they were funny and clever and enjoyable. Heck, a good mission can even get someone into something. Seeing Nume and Illraen deal with Young Wizards made me want to read it just as much as the board threads that were appearing at the time, a Labyrinth mission is what definitively put it on my list for watching (I will, I swear!), if I hadn&#39;t read LoTR by then, ToS inspired me to do so, Suicide put GoF on my radar and got me to read it (and made it weird as hell but that&#39;s another story), and while Pern had been on my list for a while, Nume, Illraen, and Derik sealed the deal.<br><br>That&#39;s about it for now.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the comments! Knowing what you&#39;re doing well is just as important as knowing what you&#39;re <i>not</i> doing well. I like to think that the &#39;connected but not&#39; thing you&#39;re commenting on is deliberate - while (for instance) readers who already know Selene will get more out of seeing her in <i>Driftwood</i>, it&#39;s by no means essential, and I did that on purpose. But... some of it is also definitely just me throwing out more ideas than are good for me, with no real thought into how they fit together. The DIO tales are a big misfit for everything else, and a lot of the non-series stories are just me mucking about. ^_^ Plus there&#39;s Reorg and Crashing Down; I have <i>no</i> idea how well they hold up.<br><br>Right, down to business. In keeping with <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=317196;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">my new standing pledge</a>, I took a look over Agent Thoth&#39;s wiki page. I think I actually read your cowrite with Nesh, so instead I&#39;ve gone back to (no surprises here, I said it in the title!) that short &#39;Thoth is recruited into the Thousand Sons&#39; story you&#39;ve got linked.<br><br>I like the script style of the backstory, and the way you switch to a traditional third-person view for the HQ part. It really emphasises the difference between the two sections. (As it happens, I&#39;m rereading <i>Ravenor</i> right now, which has a similar switch between first and third person when Gideon stops mucking about in people&#39;s heads.) It&#39;s a little thing, but it did catch my eye.<br><br>I was going to comment that Kannan seemed a little too Thoth-like, a bit too Astartes-aloof for where he&#39;s at in his life, with lines like &#39;There&#39;s no shame in your lack of belief&#39;. But then I caught the line two down from that, and realised that it&#39;s entirely deliberate: he sounds like that because he&#39;s deliberately hiding his feelings. That sets up a wonderful contrast between the two characters&#39; methods of dealing with their separation, and it definitely comes across in the dialogue.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I quite liked Reorg, in case you&#39;re curious.<br><br>Oh jeez, that story. I have... complicated feelings about it. I like it? I think? It was the first thing I got a really strong positive response on here, which I thought was Pretty Neat. Some parts feel a bit... weird, from here? I dunno. <br><br>I don&#39;t know how or if I&#39;d write it now, but I probably wouldn&#39;t write it quite like that.<br><br>Anyways, here are some hows and whys it all happened.<br><br>This was one of Nova&#39;s first prompts, and the line was &quot;When will I see you again?&quot; I&#39;d already had ideas about Thoth before being an Astartes, and that kinda sealed the deal on that, because Thoth having to leave everyone behind is pretty dang evocative image, and it was the first thing to pop into my head and I am lazy, in case you haven&#39;t noticed. Especially on prompts.<br><br>The flashback scenes came first. Originally, there wasn&#39;t going to BE a present-time scene, but then it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to ensure people know that the person in the flashback is Thoth, because it might be ambigouous. And then I decided to play up that ambiguity and lead up to a reveal—a reveal that I was pretty sure everyone would have guessed already, but a reveal all the same. Why not?<br><br>As for the style of the flashbacks... Honestly? It was an excuse for me to not write dialogue tags or describe the surroundings, as much as anything else. I&#39;m bad at dialogue tags, and none-to-great at descriptions. But more seriously, in terms of physical description, I&#39;m not entirely sure what the scene would look like: canon is kind vague about Prospero, and while I can make some educated guesses, there are other things I&#39;m a bit in the dark on. So... yeah.<br><br>I had the idea of it being an audio recording or something, so I could be lazy about visualization, and because it seemed cool. Then I had the idea of jacking the style of those interludes between Graff and Anderson (and whoever else, it varied) from <i>Ender&#39;s Game</i>. So that&#39;s that.<br><br>As for the precise content... that has a lot less to do with Thoth or anything than where I was at the time. I&#39;d just come out, both to the board and, really, to myself, and that whole thing was weighing on my mind a lot. So... well. That was the first thing I thought of. And I ran with it.</p>

            <p>Would it help if one of the agents was slightly less familiar with the canon so the other might have to explain more obscure details? Or another solution would be to create a sort of appendix providing a short 2 sentence summary for specific terms that people may not be familiar with. It usually doesn&#39;t detract from the mission reading experience if I&#39;m not a fan of the canon so long as I get informed in some way of why it is a charge.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s why there&#39;s devices like the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Pocket_Fictionary">Fictionary</a>, in-universe; even when a fic is the right division for an agent pair, that doesn&#39;t mean they have the canon knowledge! Or need to have it, as long as the mission writer is willing to do the research.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen people do post-mission A/N summaries of what&#39;s wrong about a given fic&#39;s plot-points, as well (an example off the top of my head would be SkarmorySilver, as well as Herr Wozzek&#39;s missions).<br></p>

            <p>The fix is to have a length limit and an end point in mind when you start writing. If you get to the end point and you&#39;ve exceeded the limit by a significant amount, you go back and figure out what you need to cut. Not every joke is your best joke; not every charge is a vital one. There&#39;s always something you can afford to lose. Your beta(s) may be instrumental in helping you identify what that is.<br><br>Your end point will, of course, influence your mission length. If you&#39;re PPCing 20,000 words of fic, that&#39;s probably going to result in a longer mission than 12,000 words of fic.<br><br>More agents also tends to result in higher word counts, which is one reason two is the ideal number.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S.

            <p>What I really want from a review is to know how the work made you feel when you read it. I want to know if you laughed or not, if you sympathized with the characters or not, if you <i>cared</i> or not. <br><br>That&#39;s pretty much it. I know not everyone is great at active reading—being aware of your own responses in the moment; having a sort of dialogue with the work as you read it—and that does improve with practice, but there&#39;s no special art to conveying this information once you&#39;re aware of it. The stream-of-consciousness type commentary you guys do is <i>great</i> for this. Please keep it up!<br><br>Technical points are great, too, but honestly, that&#39;s of secondary value. If the thing I did didn&#39;t have the impact I wanted, that&#39;s a sign to me to analyze my technique and seek more input about how I could have done it better. First and foremost: get on the couch and tell me how it makes you feel! ^_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Right, I&#39;m back from a wonderful two-week music camp in the mountains, and now that I&#39;ve caught up with everything, I&#39;d like to share a little music theory and other musings with regards to soundtracks. To keep this post from getting long, I&#39;m only going to present one analysis, and it&#39;s one that I think no one else has done before, so here you go.<br><br><b>Tritones are Scary</b><br>A tritone is an interval that splits the scale in half, or is essentially a fifth except the top note is flat (C and F#, D and G#, B and F, etc.) In the era of classical music, the tritone was said to be a musical manifestation of the devil, and was thus never used. Nowadays, people aren&#39;t quite as superstitious, but we still know that a tritone brings tension to music.<br><br>Take a look (er, listen) at the following examples from the soundtracks of Wolfenstein 3D and Lichtspeer (ironically using tritones on the same notes):<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jVUqzoSlpc"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jVUqzoSlpc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jVUqzoSlpc</a></a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td09zQOb6uA&amp;t=3m17sec"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td09zQOb6uA&amp;t=3m17sec">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td09zQOb6uA&amp;amp;t=3m17sec</a></a><br>Here&#39;s a little analysis:<br><br>The first, called &quot;The Ultimate Challenge&quot;, is the second boss track of Wolfenstein 3D, and it is used for the fights against General Fettgesicht (the hardest boss) and Adolf Hitler (for similar obvious reasons). The song sets up tension by beginning with the combination of a tritone interval and a seemingly uneven rhythm, then goes back and forth between clearer-sounding and dissonant chords. The B major chords feel heroic to me, and the dissonance very tense, and the song as a whole creates a nice serious contrast to the other boss theme, which is basically just a very catchy-fied Nazi Party anthem. Knowing that the iD Software of the 90s were definitely a bunch of goofballs, they could very well have known that the tritone is &quot;the devil&#39;s interval&quot; and been using it to very subtly compare Hitler to Satan. Who knows? All I know is that this song definitely didn&#39;t calm my nerves when fighting either of these bosses.<br><br>The second piece is, if I&#39;m understanding footage from boss fight compilations correctly, the theme for Lichtspeer&#39;s first boss, Das Viking Pirate King. Like &quot;The Ultimate Challenge&quot;, it constantly goes back and forth between harmony and discord (in this case, from a fifth to a tritone), but in a much simpler manner. Combined with the fact that these notes are at first played on a synth I find similar to the type of sound that&#39;s normally only reserved for aliens and ghosts, this song makes the blatant establishment that you are up against a greater threat than what you have previously seen. As with most of the boss themes, but here especially, it heavily draws on the track before it that (if I have this right) represents the levels that precede the boss. Overall, especially considering how Das Viking Pirate King himself is rather vanilla among bosses, this does a pretty good job of introducing the presence of bosses to Lichtspeer.<br><br>So now, what do you have to say about various soundtracks, for video games, movies, or anything else? Or about musicals, can&#39;t leave those out either! Just make sure it stays mostly about music theory and not about lyrics, because otherwise the whole thread will be about lyrics, won&#39;t it. Looking forward to your thoughts!<br><br>-Twistey, going off to brainwash herself with catchy electronic music... some more</p>

            <p>The music for 4X games has to really build character for the game involved, since there&#39;s not a huge amount of pre-prepared story a lot of the time. Here are a few of my favourites from the wonderful world of turn-based strategy:-<br><br><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laOHHEU4m14">Shoshone Peace Theme (Civilization V: Brave New World)</a></b><br>This is an emotional piece, recalling the experiences of the Trail Of Tears and the genocide committed against all of America&#39;s indigenous civilizations whilst still sounding absolutely majestic. It also makes a great companion piece to...<br><br><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRv501x6WP0">America Industrial/Modern Theme (Civilization 6)</a></b><br>Civ 6 is unique in 4X games for having music that actually shifts and becomes more complex as you advance through the game. This track is from the midpoint in the game, and is based (as are all the America tracks) on the parlor song &quot;Hard Times Come Again No More&quot;. This is a triumphal piece of music, full of hope and optimism and sounding like the OST of the greatest Western you&#39;ve never seen. For something meant to represent the United States, that&#39;s a good indicator that things&#39;ve gone right.<br><br><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM0JHl_EZJ8">Across The Drift (Riftborn Theme, Endless Space 2)</a></b><br>It has to be said that the historical 4X games have it quite a lot easier than fantasy or sci-fi ones - there&#39;s already a culture and body of work upon which the music can draw, rather than obliging the composer to come up with one or imply one exists. This theme for the transdimensional time-manipulating Riftborn sells their cold, ordered, but compassionate nature really well - the ticking metronomes and clocks in the background is a great touch.<br><br>More later, if you want.</p>

            <p>Knuckle Sandwich is an upcoming indie game, which is a sort of RPG kinda thing in the stylings of the Mario &amp; Luigi Superstar Saga games and Earthbound. I, in general, recommend it a <i>lot</i>. Play the <a href="http://knucklesandwich.biz">demo!</a> It&#39;s really funny and fun and also gets really really dark. <br><br>But, anyways, one of the central parts of the game, as according to its dev, is the soundtrack - indeed, from what I can tell, of the five or six people working on it, <i>everyone but the lead dev is a musician.</i> <br><br>My particular favourite songs from the demo are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OddbWVYXTa4">Back Alley Beat</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dum9I_-Pm_Y">Ninety Eight</a>. The music uses a lot of kind of sampling of human voices and so on, and, in general, fits the kind of quirky, goofy tone the game goes for.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ll just recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnTaGvsHmMy792DWeT6HbGA/videos">Nelward</a>, one of the game&#39;s musicians, as a whole. He&#39;s what drew me to it. It&#39;s kinda hard to describe his music, except as, well, sort of goofy electronic whatever such? Love that guy, anyway. </p>

            <p>Honestly, I&#39;m too tired to analyze, but I do notice that it sounds very hip-hop style, which sounds about right given the game&#39;s name is Knuckle Sandwich. I do like that human voice sampling.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Stuart Copeland (the drummer from The Police) did the soundtrack to the Spyro The Dragon PS1 games - aka. The Good Spyro Games. One of my favourite tracks in the whole series is Fireworks Factory, which really sells the level&#39;s themes of rocket ninjas without resorting to tired Orientalist leitmotifs. Check it out here:-<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZWkuMIPiPs">Fireworks Factory (Spyro 3: Year of the Dragon)</a><br><br>I&#39;m really looking forward to the Spyro: Reignited trilogy, whenever that comes out, purely because of the music.<br><br>Speaking of remasters, the N. Sane Trilogy had some fantastic music of its own that updated the tracks (which were done by one of the blokes from Devo). This, ICYMI, was the Crash Bandicoot original trilogy remaster from last summer that I drooled over. There&#39;s some pretty nice music in there, and one of my favourites is the updated Hang Eight theme, with its jungle surf theme. Another choice track from the N. Sane Trilogy is the updated Road Crash theme, which has a brilliant &#39;50s vibe.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTVhIFENgq4">Hang Eight/Air Crash/Plant Food (<i>Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</i>, N.

            <p>Those games are some of the few I&#39;ve actually played through, and the soundtrack is a big part of the reason. If I can&#39;t stand how a game sounds, I&#39;m not gonna stick to it, so a soundtrack can make or break it for me. Just about every sound in the Spyro games is charming and easy on the ears—very well designed, in my uneducated opinion. I enjoyed listening to it for hours. {= )<br><br>Listening to that track by itself, it reminds me of a CD my brother picked up featuring taiko drums. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7HL5wYqAbU">Here&#39;s an example of just drums</a>.) And then they weave the typical Spyro electronic-ish stuff back in. Pretty cool.<br><br>But, that&#39;s also part of why I got into <i>Skyrim</i>. The soundtrack, the scenery, and really everything about it is just gorgeous.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I admit I don&#39;t know enough about music to really delve into the intricacies of how they&#39;re written.<br><br>But I will take the opportunity to gush about one of my favorite soundtracks, namely to the musical <i>Hamilton</i>. An obvious pick, yes, but I love the clever lyrics, use of different music styles and the way the story is told. The words flow together smoothly and the music reflects the character and story beats (and being me a history buff doesn&#39;t hurt my enjoyment of the musical one bit... even if there are some creative liberties taken).<br><br>Sorry for the simplistic terms, I&#39;m not smart enough to understand all the technical details.

            <p>I love id Software. The board ought to know this by now. So let&#39;s start there. IMHO, Wolf3D doesn&#39;t stand the test of time, so on to the next one.<br><br>Enough has been written about the Doom soundtrack. It&#39;s great. It&#39;s also MIDI, so everyone will probably hear something slightly different. Anyone remember MIDI? Yeah.<br><br>Also, it just rips off a ton of metal. All the metal. Still great though.<br><br>Quake! Wait, Quake had a soundtrack? Yes. Yes it does. Composed by Nine Inch Nails, no less. You probably haven&#39;t noticed it because it&#39;s really ambient. Well, except for <a href="https://youtu.be/WrJX7msEPYY">that title theme.</a> If you have the Steam version, you may never have heard any of that, because Quake had a Redbook soundtrack. Read: the CD was actually an audio CD, and the game won&#39;t play the soundtrack unless it&#39;s in the drive, because it doesn&#39;t exist on disc. So the Steam version doesn&#39;t even contain a soundtrack. Thankfully, there are ways to get it working again if you download a modern sourceport.<br><br>Quake 2 got hit with the redbook problem too. Which is a shame, because speaking as a metal fan, Quake 2&#39;s soundtrack is killer. I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/nWW-U9pdN5Q"> listen to this!</a>. Q2&#39;s soundtrack is the best part of that game, easy. Which isn&#39;t hard, because it&#39;s the weakest Quake game, also easy. Throwing out the horror and oppressivenes for sci-fi action and space marines killing borg didn&#39;t serve the game well, and neither did the endless brown and grey. The Edge was a bangin&#39; DM level, though.<br><br>And finally, Quake 3, the best deathmatch game ever devised by man. I know that&#39;s high praise, but I really really really really really like this game. They brought in a few bands on this one, including the Quake 2 guys. Sonic Mayhem 1 and 5 are particularly memorable, but the one that sticks out to me most is probably <a href="https://youtu.be/fZLHEn2NlJw">this one</a>. Because it seems to play whenever I load up Q3DM17, which is probably the most played map in Quake 3 by a mile. It&#39;s also not a very good map, but that&#39;s another story.<br><br>But I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention Unreal Tournament, Quake 3&#39;s competition. Because that game also has a soundtrack, and what a soundtrack it is. Alexander Brandon is widely regarded as brilliant, and this more theatrical soundtrack doesn&#39;t disappoint. The song everyone remembers is <a href="https://youtu.be/Ql8GWBkA7L0">Foregone Destination</a>, which backed Facing Worlds, the UT99 equivalent of Q3DM17. Well, that and the fantastic <a href="https://youtu.be/ao9EsDhwtT0">Menu theme</a>. That thing is great.<br><br>Even better, and by the same guy, is the <a href="https://youtu.be/Rm9PJNF3sE0">theme to Deus Ex.</a> Oh jeez. I can listen to that all day.<br><br>More to come, probably.</p>

            <p>Fun fact: Quake wasn&#39;t supposed to have a soundtrack at all, originally. But Trent Reznor convinced the team to add it. He also did a lot of the other sound effects as well: IIRC, those grunts and screams and stuff? That&#39;s Trent.</p>

            <p>And true, the OST is pretty ambient, but it&#39;s notably different without it. You don&#39;t get those little noises and chants and such. It&#39;s a little... emptier. Less atmosphere. Trent totally made the right call.</p>

            <p>So two things:  1. I don&#39;t understand music on the same deep level of notes and such that twistey does, but there&#39;s some cleverness to the songs in this game I still want to bring up.<br><br>and 2. I realize this is a super tiny, minor fandom no one else here cares about but uh . . . I think this is at least somewhat interesting anyway?<br><br>So, for being an ultimately sub-par game, <i>Epic Mickey</i> has an utterly gorgeous and creative soundtrack, composed by James Dooley.  The basic mechanic of the game is that you can advance past obstacles either by using paint to create new objects, or to brute force through things by dissolving existing objects with thinner.  Most of the game levels (themed around Disney park attractions) have a music theme with <i>five</i> separate variations: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Elod05MCk">&quot;base&quot; version</a>, a version where you&#39;re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73mFtCvtJHQ">mostly using paint</a> to get through, a version where you&#39;re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4vqKhuWKfQ">only using paint</a> to get through, a version where you&#39;re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBfDrQrvzWU">mostly using thinner</a> to get through, and a version where you&#39;re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOvth_cJfHk">only using thinner</a> to get through.  The paint-oriented versions tend to be focused on high-pitched chimes, and are generally gentler and more light-hearted feeling than the base version.  The thinner versions tend to become very slow, with creepy violins and deep baritone notes added.<br><br>This feature was also used to hide musical easter eggs in the soundtrack.  One level has the Micky Mouse Club March hidden in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3ck5z0ecn8">its music</a>, at 1:02.  It&#39;s identifiable, but the notes and tone are way off.  Using lots of paint restores the tune to a more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwhF4Gnad-M">recognizable form</a>. (Same point in time.)  Using lots of thinner, though, appropriately <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrTB7YVp8gE">wipes that tune</a> completely out of the song!<br><br>—doctorlit hopes this is at least marginally interesting to anyone else . . .</p>

            <p>That one has It&#39;s A Small World hidden in it. I can particularly note how towards the end of the loop, the evil-sounding stuff (key: A minor) that&#39;s layered under the sweet innocent bits (key: A Major) switches to A Major as well, kinda suggesting something heroic or hopeful amidst that corruption. I don&#39;t know what happens before and after that fight, but if I were to be given context, I&#39;d probably be able to analyze it further.<br><br>Epic Mickey seems like a pretty cool game.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>It is a very cool game.  I wish the presentation had been more polished, but it was memorable nonetheless.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Clock Tower boss fight doesn&#39;t have much set-up as a character in its own regard.  (It <i>is</i> a building, after all.  It couldn&#39;t really be present anywhere but that room where Mickey fights it.)  There&#39;s a comment a little before that battle that one of the villains has made it go mad, and afterwards, it has its one line of dialogue apologizing for not acting itself.  So I guess you could say the &quot;evil-sounding stuff&quot; represents the madness, while the more normal &quot;Small World&quot; notes are the . . . more normal personality?<br><br>Incidentally, the level that features the Clock Tower as the boss at the end has a normal battle theme that also has &quot;It&#39;s a Small World&quot; incorporated into it, as well as clock-based sound effects.  It&#39;s subtle, but noticeable if you pay attention.  It&#39;s also my favorite track out of the whole game.  Give a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQNrtS9_7Ug">listen</a>?  There&#39;s a subtle tune of &quot;Small World&quot; at 0:04, a slow, baritone version at 0:14, and a stronger, dramatic version at 0:39.<br><br>—doctorlit should maybe get around to playing the sequel he&#39;s had sitting on the shelf for literally years, yeah?</p>

            <p>No, sadly I haven&#39;t found a literal Lego OFUM build (though that sounds kind of cool...).

She is shy in new situations, but quickly finds her place in a group. She is very fond of nature, faithful, a bit of a dreamer and just impossible not to like.<br><br>Power: Love<br><br>Strengths: Smart, practical and super creative.<br><br>Flaws: Gets a bit insecure and clumsy when she finds herself in a new group (especially when they are all elves..).</i><br><br>It actually gets worse from there... she&#39;s friends with a stereotypical team of element-aligned magical elves, who all have ridiculously sparkly cute animal friends (actually, because of product turnover, they have <i>multiple</i> CAFs each). So far, so generic... but check out the purported villains of the piece:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/12kBM9G.png"><br><br><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/elves/characters/goblin-king-075dff72ecbb4ccc83a1e5faf8eab457">Cronan</a>, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/elves/characters/ragana-d1e0776c438046e197c2474a2177bbe4">Ragana</a>, and <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/elves/characters/noctura-4537c7867eab4a3186632784360a1c9d">Noctura</a>... or, as I like to call them, the Elves in Black Leather: Elrond, Galadriel, and Miss Cam herself.<br><br>(Okay, we&#39;ll need to pilfer a lighter hair for Galadriel, but other than that I think they&#39;re perfect.)<br><br>Still not convinced?

            <p>FREAKIN&#39; BUY SOME AND REPAINT THEM! I WANT TO SEE IT! DO IT! YES!<br><br>Hehe, anyway... I love the villain designs. I actually like all the designs, but obviously a Mary Sue can be a Mary Sue and still have a good design. But I still love the designs. (I do character design stuff a lot, so that&#39;s usually what I notice first.)<br><br>I dunno, but I have a particular sweet spot for Ragana because I&#39;ve seen her before in a LEGO catalog and I at the time had a villain role for myself in one story where the outfit I had had was very similar to hers, even the same black-and-green color scheme and with my old Scratch avatar&#39;s orange (which is close to pink) hair. So yeah, when you posted this, I still had a little lingering feeling of &quot;mine&quot; over her. <br><br>Cronan is cool, typical warlord fare with an interesting... eye motif? That&#39;s not a path most would take, so props to Lego. Noctura is great with... is one sleeve longer or are her arms being consumed by darkness? I hope it&#39;s the latter because that&#39;s cool. I love her haircut and expression and tiara and oh my God everything is so pretty. Looking at the pages, I don&#39;t know about all the CAFs and minor critters, they&#39;re just kinda cookie cutter, but the designs of the Elves are rather aesthetically pleasing. Except Skyra... I can&#39;t tell what she is, but if she were drawn for me and explained, that might satisfy me. Oh that&#39;s a cape thingy, okay. Now I like the design.<br><br>Now the real exception is the two humans. They&#39;re also very cookie cutter, which I guess combined with Emily&#39;s description means they Could Be Anyone. They could be you. They could be me. Most importantly, they could be the viewers. So yeah, typical audience insert protagonists.<br><br>TL:DR: Love the Elf designs. Everything else is pretty cookie cutter, but the Elf designs blow me away. Also, Ragana is sooooooorta mine-ish. Sorta.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>It&#39;s good! ^<em>^<br><br>Or, if Middle-earth isn&#39;t your speed, you could try one of the other OFUs. The only trouble is, if you want a finished one, there... aren&#39;t very many.<br><br>I&#39;ve just been and updated the Wiki to list all the finished OFUs I could find, and... well, &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Official">https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Official</a></em>Fanfiction_University&quot;&gt;there are six</a>. That&#39;s taken from both our own records and Miss Cam&#39;s list. So yeah... if you want to read the LotR, Harry Potter, Hetalia, Discworld, Dragonball, or Pirates of the Caribbean OFUs, there&#39;s good news for you! If not... I hope you like cliffhangers.<br><br>(I hope to one day be the first person to finish an OFU sequel. Of course, to do that, I would have to actually start writing OFUDisc 2...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Right. There are seven <s>Shadow-Bats</s> mini-Balrogs in the theme so far: the five I included, plus these two, who don&#39;t have official pictures yet:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HGmXAmN.png"><br><br>Irritatingly, they don&#39;t make a rainbow; I&#39;m colour-blind, but I&#39;m pretty sure they line up like this:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wT6tXT7.png"><br><br>So who are they? None of their purported names (or, as I like to call them, secret identities) appear on the lists of minis, but... what if they&#39;re <i>nicknames</i>? Hippo could be one of the minis for &#39;Fellowship&#39;, for instance - Felloship, or Followship? - and Molo could be Carmollen, the mini of Cormallen.<br><br>But Phyll? Furi? There&#39;s nothing in Middle-earth even close to those.<br><br>Perhaps instead they&#39;re seven of the ten members of the fellowship.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/a7jouVf.png">: <i>Ahem...</i><br><br>Sorry, Lord Elrond, the NINE members of the Fellowship... but which?<br><br>Well, Molo and Phyll simply have to be minis Merry and Pippin, the Urple Bandits - look at the colours, and their names even start with the same letters! I feel like Hippo must be a Sam mini, too - look at that happy smile! D&#39;aww.<br><br>Four to go. Is the Frodo mini being driven crazy by the Ring - or is Crase more of a Boromir? Does Vespe&#39;s war-paint make him a mini of Aragorn, or of Legolas (who I can absolutely imagine spending an OFUM arc going full Maladict and thinking he&#39;s in &#39;Nam)? Myzo&#39;s colour-change makes him a shoe-in for Gandalf the White (perhaps he&#39;s a mispelling of Mithrandir?), and Furi&#39;s adorable rage fits nicely for Gimli... which means Vespe is more likely to be a Legolas (since those two are inseparable), and the fact that we&#39;ve got the other three hobbits means Crase should be Frodo.<br><br>So there you go - the question you never thought would be answered. ^_^ And with a bit of browsing the mini lists, plus a little creative thinking...<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wT6tXT7.png"><br><br>OR<br><br>Sham - Froedo - Glimi - Legoles - Mythrandir - Merrry - Piphin<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qBK0pN0.png">: <i>You&#39;re not very clear on the concept of &#39;undercover&#39;, are you?</i><br><br>Oops. Er... sorry, Miss Cam. <sub>I&#39;m going now.</sub><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, if any of you have heard of Mark Oshiro (of the Mark Does Stuff series - where he experiences media for the first time, for our entertainment! Though he&#39;s also been doing some writing of his own, including <i>Anger is a Gift</i>), he has covered all of the <i>Young Wizards</i> books to-date, and the Interrim Errantry novels. The clips are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xpanasonicyouthx/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=3">on YouTube</a> for those interested.<br><br>He has <i>also</i> shown interest in reading the <i>Feline Wizards</i> books... but since <a href="https://markdoesstuff.com/collections/frontpage/products/mark-reads-mark-watches-video-commission">he does this through commissions</a>, he won&#39;t be able to read the whole trilogy in one go! So if you&#39;d be interested in having him read <i>To Visit the Queen</i> and <i>The Big Meow</i>, poke around the site, send some emails, and help commission the rest of those chapters! ;)<br><br>Or just listen to him read what he&#39;s done so far; that helps, too.</p>

            <p>That sounds... difficult? Sentient Instrumentalities aren&#39;t terribly common - there&#39;s Spot, and Bobo (but he&#39;s special), and... I can&#39;t think of any others?

Brace yourself.<br><br>So, enough about me, what about you? What fandoms are you in? What do you like to do? What do you plan to do here - agent ideas, types of badfic you&#39;re interested in sporking, types of sporking, etc. How&#39;d you find us? I&#39;d love to know more!<br><br>And as for your newbie gift, since I&#39;ve apparently decided to start randomly giving out samples of fantasy substances I made up, here&#39;s a bottle of purple stuff that is not the purple stuff I gave a different newbie a while back. It is not a good purple stuff, or at least it wasn&#39;t when I invented it, which was years ago. Try experimenting with it, I haven&#39;t touched it yet and I want to see if the effects have changed over time.<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you.

            <p>The topic&#39;s maybe a little too deep for me to feel like I can comment on it, though you wrote the article in a way that I could at least follow it.  I do think it&#39;s important to examine these changes in online social trends over time, as we (or later generations of users) will eventually be discussing internet history the same way humans discuss, um . . . other history.<br><br>Your discussion on shorter pieces of fan discussion being treated with equal dignity to larger works actually reminds me of one of the themes of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>: that one of the factors that led to that setting&#39;s disillusionment with literature was the loss of free time, which led to less introspection, and less time to consume larger sources of media.<br><br><i>&quot;&#39;Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten- or twelve-line dictionary resume.&#39;&quot;</i><br><br>Pretty scary to think that fandom is starting to follow that trend in real life.  I hope the trend reverses eventually, and fandom overall migrates back to the LiveJournal/Dreamwidth style of stage.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>Transformative works is more of an umbrella/legalese term covering fanfic, fanart, fanvids, and other variants of fan-created media. The thing that distinguishes it from ye olde Anne Rice’s accusations of copyright infringement is the transformative factor because the addition of a fan interpretation ‘transforms’ the work away from its original. Like how a PPC mission is transformative of the baddie, or how badfic effect on its origin canon transforms it in the PPC universe.<br><br>And it’s specifically “Discourse” that has replaced wank, not discussion. Discourse actually started from a Tumblr meme (look up Discourse Chef) but has been used to describe wank since its memetic origins. <br><br>Nevertheless, there are definitely segments of fandom that take themselves too seriously nowadays, but hasn’t that always been the case? Srsbsns has always been a part of fandom life; most of that was relegated to closed communities, or communities dedicated to wank. People on fandom_wank knew everything there would be taken lightly; this is no longer the case on Tumblr, where joke posts can get misinterpreted all the time.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t around when you posted the survey, but I&#39;m glad I got to read this all the same. It actually helped me make sense of some things I&#39;ve been wondering about in fandom culture. As someone who entered fandom in 2009, before most of this new wave had set in, but was too young (in actual years and fandom terms) to really get it, it offered some sense to a confusing and at times contradictory perspective.<br><br>So, as I said before, a very interesting read!

            <p>Your findings absolutely reflect my subjective experience as an older/longer-term participant in fandom.<br><br>I find it very interesting that you seem to say that while discussions on newer platforms like Tumblr occur &quot;at a more rapid pace with less control over the thread of conversation&quot; and are more easily radicalized, they&#39;re being treated with  &quot;a more academic, professional lexicon&quot; that &quot;lends gravitas and credence to the arguments being expounded.&quot;<br><br>This puts a finger squarely on what bugs me about this shift. The conversation about fandom has become shorter, faster, less thought-through and lovingly (if self-aggrandizingly) developed, and yet treated more seriously? That seems backwards! Co-opting these serious academic terms in this way at once over-inflates the importance of one&#39;s opinions of fanstuff and dilutes their usefulness for people who do want to have a thoughtful discourse or need to express that they have a psychological trigger.<br><br>Too much like srs bsns.<br><br>~Neshomeh has to leave now, might have more to say later.</p>

            <p>I’m glad I could elucidate what you’ve also observed about fandom’s culture shift! It really is interesting (and a bit perplexing) that fandom’s emergence as a mainstream aspect of media consumption comes at the price of what amounts to “bite size media” being radicalised and taken too seriously, but such is the nature of microblogging sites like Tumblr, Twitter, and other content-prioritised social media becoming the hub of fandom. <br><br>I don’t know if the Board knows but there is a beta platform called Pillowfort seeking to integrate Tumblr and LJ’s strong points. And another friend of mine is working on a similar project. So we may be looking at another user base shift soon! </p>
