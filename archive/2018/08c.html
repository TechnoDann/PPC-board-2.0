            <p><i>A young woman spun in a circle, arms flung out to her sides, head tipped back to feel the rain on her face, long braid trailing in her wake. She laughed; the drops weren’t cold, stinging water, but pleasantly warm oil smelling of all sorts of lovely things - she thought she could pick out lavender, vanilla, rosemary, thyme… perhaps a hint of cinnamon, too? She closed her eyes and took a deep breath; yes, something dark and rich and smooth, even if it made her nose itch terribly. But a bit too metallic to be cinnamon. So what…?<br><br>She slipped on the slick grass; a plume of stained-glass butterflies lifted her back to her feet. The tiny woman smiled and laughed again, reaching out to touch one in pink and purple; it dissolved into wisps of smoke that danced up her arm, leaving a pleasant tingle in its wake. She eagerly reached out to the other butterflies now swirling around her; reds, blues, greens, yellows, even one or two in black or white - all dissolved at a touch, leaving her wreathed in that pleasant, varicolored smoke, clinging to her like a familiar gown. Something long, with a train to be seen for miles - perhaps a bridal gown! She smiled and raised her hands again; some of the smoke around her fingers wove itself into a thin veil, obscuring her vision only slightly with its ever-shifting colors, but covering her face and neck and shoulders, completing the image.<br><br>Something tickled at the nape of her neck, she noticed; the young woman reached back to try brushing away stray, oil-slicked hairs, and found herself touching one last butterfly. This one did not break at her touch; it rode her finger, sitting obligingly still when she raised it to the sky in a vain attempt to catch it in the light, then spread its wings to reveal that even in the storm its red-and-purple wings glittered and gleamed impossibly brightly. She had to close her eyes at the sudden pinpoints of light.<br><br>When she opened them again, she found herself in a large, loud room, filled with people laughing and conversating over glasses of what she thought was wine. It seemed a little bright to be wine, a bit thick, perhaps, but none of them seemed to care - they raised the glasses to their lips, drank as easily as if it were clear water, and raised the glasses higher in a compliment to the establishment serving it. The young woman smiled and stepped over to a table with only one woman sitting at it, a tall, pale woman dressed in a grey gown that accented her figure wonderfully - the younger woman thought jealously of her own more-than-modest bust - and a beautiful mask, pink with golden vinework and a few inches of a lacy veil sewn into the bottom, drawing attention to her cheekbones and button nose. Hair so deeply black as to almost look blue hung loose around her shoulders; she tilted her head at her newfound company. The veiled woman raised a glass with a welcoming smile, extending it to the oil-soaked girl; she took it with a smile of her own, raising it to the light to admire the way the light caught on the tiny, glittering specks suspended in the deep red liquid.<br><br>The back of her neck tickled again at that. Glittering specks in red liquid. Had she seen such a thing before? Surely not; but some part of her shied away from the thought of having anything to do with the wine in that glass, particularly from the thought of getting it onto her skin, much less willingly drinking it. She looked at the veiled woman; she was watching her calmly, but the same part of her brain shying from the drink told her that she was waiting for something. But that was ridiculous, wasn’t it? She had offered a drink to a soaked stranger, that was all.<br><br>The young woman swirled the glass experimentally, and was delighted by the way the candle-light winked off the specks. The yellowy-orange light diffused through the drink, lending it a soft glow that left her feeling giddy, lighter than air. She blinked; the smoke of her veil wove itself into a hundred butterflies no larger than the nail on her little finger, and they fluttered their tiny ways to the veiled woman, settling into her hair, one particularly brave butterfly in green and orange perching directly onto her mask. The woman’s smile shrunk slightly, and she raised one hand to brush a bit of stray hair behind her ear; the oil-soaked girl noticed that something seemed off about the image that presented. A moment later, it hit her.<br><br>The mask had no eye-holes.<br><br>That was impossible, though. How could the woman be looking at her without eye-holes in her mask? She blinked; oh, yes, the eye-holes were there. They simply had tiny veils covering them from the inside, colored to match the mask. The young woman relaxed marginally and looked at the glass again. The specks no longer seemed to be quite so evenly diffused among the thick liquid; rather, her swirling of the drink had brought them into the center of the glass. She was suddenly absolutely sure that whatever this drink was, she wanted none of it.<br><br>The veil-bound woman tilted her head slightly when her guest lowered the glass. “Would you prefer something to eat first, then?” she asked, voice floating into the young woman’s ears like a bit of the most beautiful music. She could almost see its passage, she noticed; like a trail of smoke, winding its way towards her like a ribbon rolling off its spool.<br><br>The young woman nodded and set her free hand on the back of what looked like the most comfortable chair in the room, upholstered in varying shades of pink and traced with golden vines, just like the woman’s mask. She blinked; a plate of roasted walnuts coated in thick golden honey sat in the center of the table, sending up plumes of scents so sweet they made the oil still clinging to her smell sour and rank.<br><br>She paused as she moved to set the glass on the table. She could feel something against her skin, beneath her dress of smoke. Something that scratched at her, chafing against her skin, all across her arms and back and chest and legs. The young woman took a step back; she heard not the muffled step of a smoke-booted foot, but the quiet slap of skin on stone, and beneath that the rattle of metal meeting metal. She closed her eyes, kept them closed, and breathed in--</i></p>

            <p>&quot;The unknown warrior leapt into the air, flipping over a strike from the middle Ringwraith; in the process, they twisted and slashed at the nearest foe, knocking the thing back. Even in the middle of all of that, Frodo saw them wrap their arm around the neck of the wraith who had attempted to stab them, and was treated to a glimpse of the thing&#39;s face - shocked at this feat of coordination and lack of respect for the proper rules of a swordfight, much less physics itself - before the leap&#39;s momentum caught up and knocked it off its feet. As the warrior landed on their own, they bodily tossed the Nazgûl into the nearest (and, until recently, the most stable) wall of the ruins.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure you can do that to a Ringwraith. Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I don&#39;t think they really have physical bodies anymore?

            <p>You are correct that the cloaks and hoods give them shape. Gandalf describes it as &quot;Giving shape to their shapelessness.&quot; Which is a good explanation for why they fear fire. Destroy the cloaks and they become formless. <br><br>However, at the same time, the fact that the cloaks give them a physical form means that being tossed would apply. The warrior&#39;s arm did wrap around the cloak, but it wasn&#39;t described because the battle is being watched through &#39;Ring Vision&#39; by Frodo. So he&#39;s seeing a bunch of shriveled corpses dueling with someone wearing armor, while the armored warrior sees a bunch of cloaks with swords.<br><br>No, the fic is not a crackfic, though that scene was meant to be funny. The image of someone just tossing a ringwraith was too funny to leave out.</p>

And smarter than they think you are. So you could easily burn me up.&quot; He paused, feeling the chill spread outward from his core to his limbs. &quot;But...you won’t.  Because that’s not how you operate, is it? No, you want us to unmake ourselves; there’s no point to it otherwise. As far as you’re concerned, there’s no greater pleasure than watching us burn ourselves up from a single spark that you lit.&quot; He stopped to check the integrity of the spell-circle. The chalk was beginning to smolder. Normally, this would have alarmed him. But not here. Not now. Because…<br>&quot;Because there’s always Timeheart.&quot;<br><br>The horned one cocked its head but said nothing.<br>&quot;This is why you won’t kill me, Beast. Because if you do, then I still win. I die free of your grasp, unblemished by your fire. I die as myself, rather than what I would be if you won.And that, I think, you wouldn’t stand for. While I am a free being...while my mind is my own...you will not take me. The very fires of Hell will not break my spirit. And I will sing my song to the last, even as I pass on to whatever comes next.<br>&quot;After all...there are other worlds than these.<br>&quot;So go on. Kill me. But I will die on my terms, not yours. And I defy you as is my birthright. Not by fighting back...but by refusing to break. And that will hurt you more than any spell of mine ever could.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Let&#39;s do it, I think. So I open up the latest chapter of my current project and count down ten paragraphs and what do I get but:<br><br><i>“What’s your name? What are you doing here?”</i><br><br>This is probably the least interesting paragraph in the chapter, unfortunately, and isn&#39;t particularly entertaining out of context. So instead I popped open the last project I was working on before this. Ten paragraphs in and:<br><br><i>“What brings you to the Valley?” Estel asked.</i><br><br>At least in this one you can tell what fandom it&#39;s fanfic for. That&#39;s better, I suppose. So I opened the project I&#39;d been working on before <i>that</i> and finally:<br><br><i>A ripple of surprise swept through the crowd and vanished as quickly as it had arrived. The rabbits glanced at each other and at Svedig and at Edmund, but after only another moment and another two breaths had passed, Roha stepped forward, beckoning the others to follow her. As they approached, Edmund turned away and walked several paces into the wood, where they could converse privately. Once there, he went down on one knee, and the rabbits gathered before him, looking up at him expectantly.</i><br><br>Words! That aren&#39;t dialogue! It&#39;s a miracle!<br><br>This was an interesting exercise, though. I looked at the tenth paragraph on all of my WIPs and <i>usually</i> it&#39;s dialogue. This last example was taken from a fanfic where I was pushing for a style different from what I normally do. That probably says something about me as a writer, though I&#39;m not sure what, exactly.<br><br>The most interesting tenth paragraph I found was from a more essay-style work:<br><br><i>However, magic is not</i> exclusively <i>reserved for those people. In</i> The Hobbit <i>it’s explicitly stated that the Dwarves know magical spells, according to their needs: “Then they brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, just in case they ever had the chance to come back and recover them.” Later it’s also implied that both the Dwarves of Erebor and the Men of Dale could enchant objects and often used this ability to enchant toys and musical instruments. The description of Hobbits offered at the beginning of the book also suggests that they have some inherent magical ability: “There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off.”</i></p>

            <p>Do you discuss what Tolkien actually <i>means</i> when he says &#39;magic&#39;? There&#39;s some very telling quotes in the Lothlorien chapters, starting with this from Galadriel:<br><br><i>&quot;[The Mirror] is what your folk would call magic. I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel.&quot;</i><br><br>But even more this exchange:<br><br><i>`Are these magic cloaks? &#39; asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.<br><br>`I do not know what you mean by that,&#39; answered the leader of the Elves. `They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lórien that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.&#39;</i><br><br>Is it magic to weave so much of your environment into a cloak that it can render someone nearly invisible? Is it magic to forge an unbreakable shirt of mithril? Is it magic to make instruments which sound sweeter than a hand-carved pipe, or fireworks which explode gloriously in the sky? How much magic is there in the outer wall of Minas Tirith, built from unbreakable stone, or in Elrond&#39;s healing abilities? And how much in a securely locked and hidden treasure-hoard, or the ability to move in silence and keep out of sight of clumsier folk?<br><br>The only flashy, swords-and-sorcery magic in LotR comes either from &#39;the deceits of the Enemy&#39; as Galadriel says (and even here it is usually &#39;innate abilities&#39; rather than spells and sorcery), or from the Ringbearers: Gandalf&#39;s various tricks with fire, Galadriel&#39;s Mirror, Elrond&#39;s flooding of the river (with Gandalf&#39;s assistance), and the invisibility conferred by the One.<br><br>I don&#39;t really have a coherent point - just the idea that &#39;magic&#39;, as used by Tolkien, is a term rife with deliberate ambiguity.<br><br>As to your other quotes: as a fellow sufferer of alwaysdialogitis, I absolutely sympathise. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The scope of the essay I was writing was bigger than that, so I touched on it only briefly.<br><br>You make some good points, but I would like to add an additional observation: &quot;magic&quot; in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is almost exclusively a Hobbit word. Hobbits throw it around like cheap birthday presents, but almost no one else uses it, except for Gandalf and Aragorn occasionally when talking to Hobbits. The only non-Hobbits who seem to use the word are the Men of Bree, and that&#39;s only vaguely conferred in the collective sense: <i>&quot;[Pippin and Sam] found themselves left alone in a corner, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them as the companions of a travelling <b>magician</b> of unknown powers and purpose&quot;</i> (emphasis mine).<br><br>Even very superstitious men who distrust what they don&#39;t understand use different words; consider Boromir&#39;s doubts about Lothlorien and Galadriel. <i>&quot;But of that perilous land we have heard in Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few none have escaped unscathed.&quot;</i> And later: <i>&quot;I do not feel too sure of this Elvish Lady and her purposes.&quot;</i> Magic, obviously, is what Boromir is afraid of; power he doesn&#39;t understand and can&#39;t control. But he never uses that word, and this, I think is an intentional choice on Tolkien&#39;s part.<br><br>What is this choice? Maybe that &quot;magic&quot; as a catch-all phrase for supernatural power is a phrase only used by people who are separated from it and have little to no experience with it and don&#39;t <i>want</i> experience with it? (Though some magic in Tolkien&#39;s work is arguably not really supernatural.) Or maybe not. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I <i>am</i> sure a point is being made.<br><br>On a tangentially related note, it&#39;s worth considering that Tolkien once stated that he had doubts about using the word &quot;wizard&quot; to describe Gandalf and Saruman. He said he preferred the word &quot;Istari&quot;, which is, of course, a word that he made up. This isn&#39;t really relevant, besides &quot;wizard&quot; being a word usually closely related to &quot;magic&quot;.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that Tolkien has a very West African attitude towards magic, wherein magic is created by <i>making</i> things rather than saying words. So the answer to your obviously-rhetorical question about whether elven cloaks or mithril armour or sweet-sounding instruments constitute magic is, frankly, yes. They do. Magic-as-magic words is very much a European thing, and does not have the universality that Western fiction ascribes to it.<br><br>Also, your comment about whether or not fireworks are magic reminds me that I really, <i>really</i> have to <s>write<s> finish that story plan I wrote up ages ago about Moria and Erebor dwarfs reinventing gunpowder, because those are some excellent parallels and I think it&#39;d make for a more interesting and well-rounded fic. =]</s></s></p>

            <p>Pippin definitely considers the cloaks of Lorien magic; just as definitely, the elves of that wood don&#39;t. So the question &#39;are they magic&#39; has a very Elvish answer - &#39;both yes and no&#39;. To the elves, they&#39;re just craft.<br><br>I absolutely agree that Tolkien considered magic to mostly be making things, but the people in his world often <i>didn&#39;t</i>. No hobbit would say that being able to walk quietly was magical - but Big Folk certainly would! It&#39;s one of Tolkien&#39;s subtler messages that he snuck in: that magic, to the people who actually practice it, is just normal skill.<br><br>(This probably doesn&#39;t extend to Luthien pulling a Rapunzel; that&#39;s a bit different. Probably. But who knows? Maybe it was all the rage in Doriath back in the day.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;At that precise moment, there was a brilliant flash of light over the horizon, the entire world seeming to tremble. The Kraken&#39;s coincidental timing made him swell with selfish pride at being &quot;validated&quot;, seemingly knowing that this was in fact what the warning he&#39;d claimed to have received had been about. The sky turning to fire was due to a mountain-sized rock from the depths of space, guided by not but the whims of fate, slamming into the planet just off the coast of what would one day become the land bridge between the Nearctic and Neotropical realms. The blast front of the asteroid impact was now traveling across the world at hundreds of miles an hour, stirring up the oceans into tidal waves capable of leveling entire nations and obliterating everything in its path. Thanks to the vibration-sensing cells in his snout, the Caiman realized what was happening well before the Kraken did, and having inadvertently absorbed much of the light that had bathed him when the asteroid hit, he seized one of his opponent&#39;s remaining tentacles in one of his taloned hands before driving the claws of the other into the spot between his eyes and unleashing a solar flare from his palms at point-blank range. The resulting mortal agony caused the Kraken to rocket up towards the surface out of instinct, carrying his envenomed captive with him... straight into the path of an oncoming tsunami. The result was nothing short of awe-inspiring, the two monsters locked in mortal combat even as the wall of water carried them with increasing speed towards the nearest island... whereupon they were smashed into the unforgiving soil and rock like salami shot from a mortar. The Caiman&#39;s jaws had been freed during their struggle and were now locked on one of the Kraken&#39;s remaining arms, their relentless crushing grip and the inertia of the monsters&#39; separation being enough to rip the tentacle away from its owner, who sailed through the air before hitting the side of the island mountain and actually cracking his shell to pieces upon impact. Disgusting white ink and dark blue blood sprayed in all directions before the Kraken slumped down listlessly, his one remaining tentacle twitching feebly but nonetheless with a glazed-over look of smug satisfaction in his colorful eyeballs. The &quot;prophecy&quot; he had told the Caiman of really had come true after all and with it, so had the reptile&#39;s &quot;ignominious downfall.&quot; To this the Caiman&#39;s yellow-green eyes widened in disbelieving contempt before he hissed that he&#39;d warned the Kraken that there&#39;d be squid guts everywhere if he messed with his mate, but <i>he didn&#39;t listen.</i> The Kraken responded with a wave of his tentacle corresponding to the rudest gestures among modern civilization before using it to drag himself back into the sea, declaring that the Sea Turtle was living on borrowed time and that once he finally came for her, the Caiman would no longer be around to save her.&quot;<br><br>This is part of a work of worldbuilding lore from one of my original writing projects, which is very focused on fantasy creatures, speculative fiction, and future evolution under the influence of magic. Since it isn&#39;t actual finished scenes with dialogue and such, I went with a more summary-ish approach with much more exposition; I&#39;m sure the stuff that&#39;ll be seen in the actual chapters will be much more novel-like.<br><br>And yes, the &quot;mountain-sized rock from the depths of space&quot; is exactly what you think it is. ;)</p>

            <p>So, this hits the tone to be a type of creation myth, and that seems to have been the aim. The Kraken certainly seems to be of the malevolent archetype for the world. I was surprised he survived. I first thought it was indicating he was dying. I think the Caiman did die? Or least didn&#39;t move much more in this paragraph. This was a very descriptive phrase &quot;like salami shot from a mortar&quot;</p>

            <p>While it follows Earth&#39;s natural history much more accurately than most such legends do, the elements of deities and chthonic monsters doing battle and changing the course of history worldwide are still there.<br><br>Since this takes place long before the main story - which is more character-focused with said deities being external allied forces they communicate with - I guess it&#39;s safe to spoil how the ending goes: the Caiman is mortally wounded, but instead of being outright killed he dies peacefully in the company of the Sea Turtle (who is his mate, best not to think about the biology of that &#39;cuz it&#39;s kaiju lore stuff XD). Said Sea Turtle absorbs the Caiman&#39;s strength and aspects, and many millions of years later, she becomes the first confirmed deity of the magical world after she gets all the other sea monsters on the planet to help her kill the Kraken for good. There&#39;s several other legends I&#39;m currently working on, and I&#39;ve in fact finished one, but I&#39;m probably gonna have to set up all six myths in order to define the full roster of deity monsters in this setting (at least 22, maximum 24, all of which follow a sort of tarot motif because yay occult and divination!).<br><br>And this goes to everybody: I&#39;m also open to beta readers and general feedback from people who are fond of science fantasy, creature design, worldbuilding, speculative fiction, and monsters and kaiju, all of which feature prominently in this project. Hopefully, your feedback may also be helpful in getting me to develop character ideas and plot threads for the actual story, too! Just shoot me an email if you guys are interested in giving it a look. :)</p>

            <p>&quot;&#39;Correct.  The drainage of energy into Thirty Hs occurs at regular intervals.  Since no spies or action agents have returned from the story, we have no evidence pointing to the cause.&#39;&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s a DMSE&amp;R researcher speaking, since the mission takes place before the DAS was formed.

            <p>Currently, my only WIP is updating the Plort wiki, so here is the last edit that actually added a paragraph rather than just changed a few words:<br><br><i>Since Cassie lost her Barony due to being absent too long, Sir Ekyl and his men-at-arms have not been seen outside of his fief; he is probably just minding his own business, hoping to be left alone by both Barons Eshakhar and Huinesoron.</i><br><br>And – not counting lines in new infoboxes – the tenth-to-last paragraph:<br><br><i>Although there is a landing, the fort is not easily accessed by boat, since the upper Kattekri-tri is difficult to navigate. Most knights trained at Los Taelis prefer the journey on the Vaybek Road to sail against the Marizu from Mei&#39;n Payj. </i><br><br>HG</p>

            <p>So, the characters sound like they may be a bit of scoundrels or con men with the talk of a bug score that could set them up for life, but the last line turns it around to pretty funny. Not that I think the characters will find it funny, but I do.</p>

            <p>The character being spoken about did survive.<br><br>That line was Nathan Wuornos speaking to the antagonist of the story.<br><br>It&#39;s from a Haven AU fanfic. The fourth in a series (pretty far down the rabbit hole now) that started off with a &#39;What if a certain character (The Rev) had been interrupted in his attempt to murder a teenage girl by a different character than in the episode?&#39; If it had been anyone else The Rev would have survived the encounter and been free to wreak much more havoc than he did when he returned as a ghost.<br><br>The first story revolves around that. The second two much shorter ones are a continuation of the AU world, and the one I haven&#39;t finished brings in a new bad guy and group. <br><br>The new bad guy essentially started a cult made up mostly of people who are still angry over things that happened in the first one, but some from canon events. His cult has a goal of &#39;reconciling&#39; various people and groups with the town in a misguided attempt to make everyone get along. Their idea of reconciliation tends toward eye for an eye and the leader doesn&#39;t have the level of control he thinks he does of some of his followers who are really just out for revenge. <br><br>I could totally go on and on, but maybe cutting it off here keeps it from being too much.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s actually an engagement party.

            <p>Plato’s Cave describes a group of individuals who’s entire world is nothing but an alit cave wall and the shadows that play on it. What they don’t know (until one does) that behind them is a group of people playing some sick practical joke, probably across several generations. The sly dogs! So some… guy? Really his motives weren’t really talked about in our play, and I’m just lazy enough to not read the actual passage. Anywho, this guy releases The One That Does and he goes on a magical journey of discovering things like Light, Outside, and the Sun. Then he goes back to the cave (Question: Why?). So The One That Does tells his friends about this magical new world and all the <i>knowledge</i> he knows, but his friends consider knowledge as “Can You Name This [Shadow] Fast enough?” but because The One That Does has, sadly, discovered <i>Adaptation (eye)</i>, he can’t do it (one wonders why The One That Does doesn’t collude with the Shadow Jokers so he can say that he can predict what appears, but that’s neither here nor there). So, because The One That Does a.) Cannot win the game and b.) Keeps talking about the outside, his friends kill him. Jerk move friends, jerk move.<br><br>((From a bit of Philosophy homework))</p>

            <p>Being that this story takes place almost entirely during the Invasion, I wanted to make sure that it had appropriate levels of Pathos.  One way to do that is to take a usually comedic character and cast them in a realistically serious light.

            <p>...

            <p>On AO3 there are about 600 f/f alpha/omega fics, but I think the exclusion criteria could definitely be stricter. After seeing a few tags I had not imagined existed, though I suppose I should have known they did given what ABO fics do to male anatomy, I decided to leave it at about 600. That leaves just over 40,000 in the other categories,mostly m/m at about 35,500.  So...mostly a m/m focused kink.</p>

            <p>I find the idea of preparing for the Badfic Game a little ironic and funny. I mean, it&#39;s badfic. Preparation isn&#39;t usually a concept associated with badfic, y&#39;know? Multiple people doing it is even funnier. {= )<br><br>Plus, I have now handily communicated to the FfW Admins that interest is running high this year, so hopefully they can step up whatever measures they&#39;re taking against the incursions of Lichtenstein in order to open the doors for us sooner rather than later. ^_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In fact, I&#39;ve prepared premises for entries several years in advance. This is not because I&#39;m obsessed with the BfGs specifically at all, but rather because I can&#39;t stop coming up with ideas, especially if the ideas are jokes. Interestingly enough, the Shipfest isn&#39;t the same way for me. I guess it&#39;s because I don&#39;t really do shipping in general, but I love making joke characters and stories, and it seems I&#39;ve therefore taken it upon myself to really flesh out Fanfic World.

<li>My joke fics tend to be way long. Like, I couldn&#39;t finish &quot;The New Recruit&quot; <i>or</i> &quot;Man on a Mission&quot; in the time I was given. So I write a few chapters ahead of time and put an outline so that I can finish it with the time I&#39;ve been given. (Speaking of MoaM, I&#39;m still finishing it. It&#39;ll hopefully be out for the next Shipfest. Don&#39;t worry, Thoth/Guardsman Tom gets nullified in part 2. So does Twistey x Voyd.

I can write out my badfic ideas, wait for them to simmer, and then if they&#39;re bad, I can destroy them before they get put on the Board. I&#39;ve already decided to take out one of my fictional badficcers because she had no gimmick other than being really angry and calling the PPC the &quot;Protectors of Cringe Culture&quot; over and over.

Maybe soups, too, because those can last for a good long while.<br><br>If I impress my roommates enough with my cooking, I just might be able to convince them to chip in for meals and I&#39;ll make enough for everyone. :P<br><br>As for easy and quick—my brother&#39;s favorite pasta. Angel hair, enough olive oil to coat the pasta, about three or four cloves of garlic, parsley, salt, and red pepper. Heat up the oil in a saucepan, let the garlic brown, throw it into the pasta pot, and add parsley, salt, and red pepper flakes to taste. It doesn&#39;t take long to make, either—basically, as soon as you drain the pasta and throw in the oil and other things, it&#39;s good to go.</p>

(I did. I did that. I like slightly chunky large-pot oatmeal very much.) That and gaming snacks, because D&amp;D without Oreos is unthinkable.<br><br>I did have to cook for myself during my internship in Philly, though, and also my study-abroad in England, and I ate pretty well. Granted, we ate out a fair bit in England, because we were traveling around and there were interesting things to try, but still. You can do a lot with a bag of frozen chicken, pasta, and salad. Just switch out what else you&#39;re putting on top, make sure to use it up, and it works! One of my go-tos is fettuccine alfredo. I like the pouch sauce mix, but a jar is good, too. Add frozen peas and chicken, it&#39;s good stuff. Think I did a low-brow chicken parmesan at one point too, though that might have been one of the nights several of us got together for a group meal.<br><br>Maybe don&#39;t go with like half a bag of spinach and dried mango, though? I regretted that one. Had to eat the spinach, though...<br><br>Oh, and take care of your dishes.

            <p>If you want to do this, you&#39;ll probably have to order capellini rather than capelli d&#39;angelo. The latter is a bit more of a niche product here, and either way up you&#39;ll need to get it from online shopping services.<br><br>As for pasta recipes, well, I do a pretty good cheapo bolognese.<br><br>You will need:-<br><br>Mince (1 cheapo supermarket box)<br>Onion (White or red, doesn&#39;t matter which)<br>Carrot <br>Celery<br>Garlic<br>2 Tins Tomatoes<br>2 Beef Oxo Cubes<br><br>Peel and chop an onion, chop or crush some garlic, chop a carrot or two into thin-ish slices, and chop a bunch of celery for bulk. Get your saucepan nice and hot and bung a bit of olive oil in - if it starts hissing and spitting like an angry cat, you&#39;re good to go. First add the onion, wait until it&#39;s starting to go clear, then add the carrots, then the celery, then the garlic. Once the onions are nicely browned and the carrots are soft, brown off the mince. If your pan&#39;s looking a bit dry when you add the mince, a little more olive oil won&#39;t hurt. When the meet is browned off, add the tinned tomatoes, crumble in the Oxo cubes, and stir on a high heat for about 5 minutes. After that, transfer it to a low heat, put a lid on the pan, and let it simmer in the pot for an hour or two. Stir it every 15-20 minutes. Once it feels done, it probably is, so whack a pan of water on to boil and select your pasta of choice. I like tagliatelle with this because... well, because it&#39;s Mel&#39;s favourite, if I&#39;m honest, but any long pasta is fine with the exception of the really thin stuff like capellini.<br><br>It&#39;s not <i>quick</i>, not by any stretch of the imagination, but it&#39;s easy to the point that you can do it whilst playing Overwatch, so that&#39;s good. You can also scale up the quantities fairly easily, meaning you&#39;ve got shedloads of it for your freezer. =]</p>
