            <p>Overall, I think you&#39;re looking pretty good! Just a couple things I wanted to flag:<br><br>First, from Mei&#39;s bio, stealing all the left socks is funny. Telling Potterverse canon children that &quot;Dumbledore dies in the end&quot; is less so. Be careful that Mei&#39;s pranks do not get too mean or actually damage the canon.<br><br>Second, somewhat related, your writing style seems to be straddling the line between serious and comic. I really enjoyed the humor in the second prompt, but the Cafeteria scene had me a little worried when it came to the mentions of silverware embedded in the walls and frozen coffee spears. In a totally comic setting with totally comedic violence, it would probably be fine, but because I&#39;m not entirely sure yet what tone you&#39;re going to settle into, those things seemed a little too dangerous to be funny. So, watch out for that sort of thing, too.<br><br>Those two things aside, I liked both prompts. The first one quickly drew me in and had me interested in the outcome, and the second one, as I said, was pretty funny. I loved &quot;Coffee went boom!&quot; Poor intern. {X D<br><br>Assuming you meant Erron and Mei by &quot;both characters,&quot; I&#39;d support putting Sylendre in Floaters, once she&#39;s been trained up a bit. The more agents on a team, the longer the mission gets to give everyone enough screen time, so keeping it to two most of the time is a good idea. Having her still share their RC might be interesting, though.<br><br>(BTW, how is &quot;Sylendre&quot; pronounced? My brain wants to make it like &quot;cylinder.&quot;)<br><br>I&#39;d normally advise avoiding anything remotely connected to a Legendary Badfic for an early mission, but seeing as you&#39;ve got your self-sporking lined up first, and &quot;Im Not Okay&quot; doesn&#39;t really look that dire, you may well take it in stride. I&#39;m willing to find out.<br><br>So, with that, Permission Granted!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s definitely cool to learn anything new about the Canon Librarian.  I love the little glimpse we&#39;ve gotten into his &quot;nest,&quot; as well as some more vague hints at his physical presence.<br><br>The mood throughout this piece is great.  I love that is keeps ramping up a more and more sinister feeling of foreboding, only to pull the rug out from under us in the last paragraphs and turn it very sentimental and reverent of Scape&#39;s work.  Very nicely done!<br><br>The fact that the Canon Librarian seems to know what World One authors are writing for the PPC has intersting implications, especially considering he himself clearly isn&#39;t from World One . . . I must ask, though: what are <i>The Everbright Glede</i>, <i>The Magical Adventures of Ladies and Gentlemen</i> and <i>The Kraken-Knights of Wintertide</i>?  I can&#39;t find mention of them online anywhere.  They&#39;re not in the &quot;PPC authors&quot; cupboard, but they&#39;re in the same safe as that cupboard.  What&#39;s the significance of those titles?<br><br>—doctorlit still wants to buy a copy of that book, Scapegrace!</p>

            <p>I enjoy the Harry Potter series, also Warhammer 40,000, Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s The Witcher series, and various other things. I discovered the PPC via Television Tropes and Idioms (tvtropes), and I hope to write PPC missions using agents Colonel Caleb Bradbury (a retired Argentinian army officer from world 1.567 repeating), and Rasputin Gibbs ( reptilian humanoid from world 1.963, where most conspiracy theories are true). My writing credentials include two completed National Novel Writing Months, and various short stories. I look forward to aiding in the fight against badfic.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I&#39;ve read the Constitution, and I shall introduce myself. I have some knowledge of many popular canons, and the three things I like the most are John Hodgman&#39;s Complete World Knowledge trilogy, Warhammer 40,000, and the short stories of Argentinian magical realist and knife-fighting enthusiast Jorge Luis Borges. Outside of those I have eclectic tastes in music, from heavy metal (mostly Powerwolf, Sabaton, and Tool), to opera of the romantic era (I have listened mostly to the works Wagner and Stravisky). To be honest, eclectic describes most of my tastes.</p>

            <p>Last night, Mr Sprinkles asked me in PM on Discord whether people would be okay with him returning to the PPC Discord.<br>To those who do not know, since he joined, Mr Sprinkles was very active on the Discord, and, in my opinion, a great member of the PPC. On New Year&#39;s Eve, he had what appears to be a major meltdown, and said several things I&#39;d prefer not to repeat here, that generally boiled down to &quot;You don&#39;t matter to me.&quot;, &quot;My existence is meaningless.&quot;, &quot;You don&#39;t know the real me.&quot; and &quot;You are lying when you say that you care about me.&quot;. The meltdown ended with him leaving the server on his own (He was not kicked as far as I know). After a while, he apparently asked Cal via PM to pass on his apology and that he was feeling slightly better, which she did.<br>Mr Sprinkles came back a few hours later for a short period of time, to positive reactions from those who were online at the time. He again apologized for what had happened, and left again shortly after, due to needing a break from the PPC after what had happened.<br>Yesterday evening, he asked me whether I would be willing to poke the server about whether people would be okay with him coming back. I did so, and the initial reaction was positive, until Ix objected, without declaring any reasoon for doing so. After that the chat dissolved into discussion, and due to the issue being serious, and the suggestions of some people in the chat, I&#39;m bringing the issue to the Board.<br>My personal opinion: In the PMs with me, Sprinkle has apologized multiple times over, and (as far as I can tell) deeply regrets what happened. From what he told me it also transpired that he apparently was not entirely in control of his actions at the time, which he described to me in later PMs as feeling like &quot;a forced shift in personality&quot; and an &quot;alternate personality forcibly taking over&quot;.<br>I&#39;d be happy to have him back anytime.<br>~Ak<br>PS: Something important to  note is that he was never banned,and that to my knowledge noone even publicly proposed any kind of ban against him.</p>

            <p>I realize this issue is rather moot now, but I still feel this should be added.<br><br>Yesterday, I had it pointed out to me that as a result of some circumstances that have/are hurt(ing) him, Sprinkles has been infected with (this is the best verb I can think of here) certain persistent patterns of behavior and conversation style that, in the aggregate, would (in the judgement of the person explaining this) almost surely cause something like this incident to reoccur if Sprinkles came into contact with other vulnerable people similar to X (the victim currently at issue). That is, there is very good reason to believe this issue would not be an isolated incident.<br><br>It was further pointed out to me that this was something that would be quite resolvable with some help, but that because of some circumstances Sprinkles is in, he wouldn&#39;t be in a position to receive such help at or near this time. This concern for X and other people that would be drawn into similar situations make the person I was talking to uncomfortable with having Sprinkles in the PPC Discord.<br><br>I&#39;d like to reiterate that this doesn&#39;t make Sprinkles a bad person or anything like that. I hope Sprinkles can get away from the circumstances that are causing and prolonging this issue and get help and healing.<br><br>I have somewhat lower estimates of the probability of recurrence than the person who explained this to me did. However, I know basically nothing about this type of issue. In light of this information, I find myself rather unsure that my proposed solution would have actually solved anything. I am also, however, not entirely convinced that making Sprinkles leave under these circumstances would have been a precedent we would want to set.<br><br>I just don&#39;t know what we should have done anymore. I thought I had a good idea. It turns out that may not have been the case. So, even though we are not deciding on anything anymore, I (entirely symbolically) abstain.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Whether or not this continues, which I sincerely hope it doesn&#39;t, I am backing out of it. All of it. Having been involved with both concerned parties for a notable length of time, I am personally shattered that it ever came to this. I think I&#39;m still in denial of what&#39;s happening; what I saw during the previous months is so starkly different from what&#39;s gone on the past few days, I can scarcely believe this is real. For that matter, I am deeply sorry. I&#39;m sorry that this happened in the first place and I&#39;m sorry for any and all pain I caused during this argument. If I&#39;ve wronged you in any way, I acknowledge it and I apologize with all the sincerity I can muster. I feel as though I have lost my family over the course of this discussion and nothing about what seems to be the final assessment sits well with me, but it&#39;s apparently not my place to say. I&#39;m not in possession of the full facts and I&#39;m honestly not qualified to be here, making judgements. I am sorry for my hurtful words, I am sorry for overstepping my bounds, and I am sorry that I can&#39;t agree with most/many of you. I hope that in time, we can all recover from this, and that someday I&#39;ll be able to wash the bitter taste from the back of my throat. But for the time being, I need both time and space, so this is my goodbye.</p>

            <p>Okay, now that I&#39;ve read everything people have posted, I have to say I don&#39;t support the idea of Sprinkles coming back into the chat at this time for a few reasons which I&#39;ll lay out. Let me say something that&#39;s been said many times before by other people, but bears mentioning again: Sprinkles, I hope you get the support and help you need. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a bad person; I just think the best thing for everyone would be to take a break for a while.<br><br>Now, as to why.<br><br>As I see it, Sprinkles has been abusing at least one person for an extended period of time, and that person reached out to others for help before deciding to block Sprinkles. I don&#39;t think Tomash&#39;s proposal is realistic precisely *because* it&#39;s ideal. People are not ideal. People make mistakes. I think it&#39;s likely that some kind of accidental interaction between Sprinkles and Person X will happen, and that that interaction could be harmful to at least one of them, to say nothing of the rest of the community as a whole if it happens outside PMs. Tomash has a good proposal, I just think it&#39;s not likely to be followed even if everyone has the very best of intentions (and I&#39;m not saying anyone doesn&#39;t).<br><br>Now, I haven&#39;t been in contact with Sprinkles. I don&#39;t know his exact situation or what steps he&#39;s taking in real life. I don&#39;t know who Person X is, so I can&#39;t speak for them. Maybe other people know more and haven&#39;t said anything yet that could change my mind, and if that&#39;s the case (and people are comfortable sharing), I&#39;d appreciate hearing it. Unless and until that happens, though? The safest option for both Sprinkles and Person X is for Sprinkles to cut contact through the PPC Discord.<br><br>What happens in PMs between Sprinkles and other people in the PPC is outside what I&#39;m willing to talk about. I&#39;m only suggesting he be asked politely but firmly to stay off the PPC Discord server for at least a few months... and most importantly, we should defer to Person X as for when (or even if) to let Sprinkles back in.</p>

            <p>When I wrote the above post, I only knew Sprinkle&#39;s side of the story.  I was not aware of the extent of the abuse, to the point where the interactions between Sprinkle and the victim that I was aware of did not even register as abuse to me, or the extent of the distress it caused them. Had I known about it, I would have featured it in the post; however I fully understand the victim&#39;s decision not to share it with me. I did attempt to contact the victim; both to try and set up a discussion between them and Sprinkle, and to find out their side of the story. They refused, a decision that I do not blame them for in the slightest. At that time however, I attempted to get their story even after they told me to drop the subject. I have already apologized to them in private, but that happened before I brought the discussion to the Board. Due to what I learned from this discussion,  I think a second apology is in order. I am sorry for not respecting the victim&#39;s wish not to discuss the matter. I fully understand their decision not to, and should not have pressed the topic.<br><br>As to what happened, I do share the opinion that Sprinkle did not intentionally inflict abuse on the victim. I also think that shutting of Sprinkle was a good decision, or at least better than keeping up the abusive relationship. Was it the best option there was? I have honestly no idea. I think things might have turned out better in the aftermath if they had maybe asked someone they trusted to explain the situation to Sprinkle. However, I do not blame them for not doing so, and I am not sure if I would have done it if I had been in their situation.<br><br>Maxe&#39;s idea of a moderated discussion sounds like a good idea in theory,  but, as they admit themselves, it is not practical in this case,  and trying force both parties into it would be a horrible idea.<br><br>I support Sprinkle being allowed back,  however I also think Tomash&#39;s proposal, possibly with a few tweaks and clarifications,  is a good idea, but I&#39;d be interested in hearing the victim&#39;s thoughts on it if they are  willing to voice them, either themselves or through Delta.<br><br>One final note to everyone: There is something important to learn from this situation for everyone who offers emotional support to others. First, what you&#39;re doing is admirable. But you must never forget to take care of yourselves. Back in EMT training,  we learned a principle that roughly translates to &quot;Make sure you are safe before attempting to save others.&quot; It was mostly meant as a warning to look out for possible dangers and not to take unnecessarily risky actions. I don&#39;t want to say&quot;Don&#39;t help others if you have mental health Issues yourself&quot;, in a lot of cases having experience with mental illnesses can be very helpful. I want to say that your own wellbeing is important as well. (Again,  this is *not* intended as an attack on the victim, but as an important warning to others).<br><br>~Ak</p>

            <p>This is a multifaceted issue and I don&#39;t know if I can really lay all my support onto a single person here.<br><br>Not all the parties involved are talking about this. And it is more people like Nesh who weren&#39;t present in this should be speaking up, because though this (the lashout from Sprinkles in the main discord) was somewhat of an isolated event, the more people who can talk about it, the more fleshed out and more understood a situation will be.<br><br>I do support that this was a mental issue, being that there was a trigger involved! In the moments directly before the lashout Sprinkles was talking about how his biological brother was harassing and threatening him. This is something that can cause trauma, if it happens often. <br><br>I&#39;m also assuming that all the other times where he lashed out to his victim that it was also caused by something.<br><br>But even if it was caused by something else does it excuse him lashing out to the chat? I mean, given that he had no control over his emotional and mental state I&#39;d say that it does, but there&#39;s always the option of not even looking at the chat at all and not communicating. I was a large part in the discussion and I assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that Sprinkles was going on a downswing and from the way he was talking it sounded very similar to the times in which I myself felt like killing myself, and I tried to draw away from that as much as possible. I suppose if I hadn&#39;t been there and kept disagreeing with him and attempting to get him to see the brightness of life and the good that the lashout would have been much shorter. Was it wrong of me in that case to step in? Maybe so, maybe not. I don&#39;t know how things would have turned out if I hadn&#39;t.<br><br>But, this was not the only lashout, and this is why I am having trouble forming a solid opinion. There was a singular person, who tried to handle it all. Who took much more of what Sprinkles said and was not equipped to handle it. I don&#39;t believe Sprinkles understood what he was doing to the person. I think that based on the reactions that he&#39;s mentioned that he was under the impression that things were going ok, because they were helping him, and he was unaware that he had inadvertently become abusive towards them. The person directly contacted me and asked me to help them out with the downswings. I tried to give as best moral support as I could. They asked me to talk to Sprinkles about this so they wouldn&#39;t have to deal with it all by themselves. But I took a stance that if I actually tried to talk to Sprinkles about it that it would destroy his trust in both of ours, something that I didn&#39;t want to be lost, because I believed that the damage of me directly talking to him about what he was saying would cause him to turn away from the entire community. In hindsight, I would have taken more responsibility and metaphorically tried to take Sprinkles off them. But everything is clearer in hindsight, and I can&#39;t change those events now. <br><br>I want Sprinkles and the person to work it out, in a moderated discussion. I don&#39;t see that happening any time soon.<br><br>I&#39;m still not entirely sure where I stand on this. I&#39;m for Sprinkles staying in the PPC. I&#39;m for the victim speaking about this, whether directly or relayed through Delta (speaking of, Delta, you&#39;re incredibly kind and thoughtful for doing so).</p>

            <p>I do want to throw in my general support for Delta Juliette, Matt Cipher, hS, and basically everyone begging us all to remember the anonymous person and take them seriously. The lone voice daring to speak out against abuse must not be dismissed simply because they are in the minority and the person who has hurt them is otherwise well-respected. As the world at large is coming to realize, that is wrong and cannot continue. Being in the minority and in a position of less power does not make them incorrect.<br><br>That said, I get that this is not a simple, clear-cut situation, and I am proud of everyone for not being so blindly committed to one person or the other that they can&#39;t see both sides. This is hard, and I think you&#39;re all doing an admirable job of navigating through it. I know you&#39;ll make the best decision you can.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s probably unwise to type this literally minutes before work... Then again, people who are in a rush tend to write what&#39;s on their mind, without taking time to sound more neutral or PC. So here goes:<br><br>Sprinkles is not a bad guy. That has to be established first. He&#39;s a bloke with problems, just like many of us. I have no details about his life situation, but suffice to say it&#39;s not easy. He deals with his problems, and I believe that being among the PPC people kinda helped him in that matter. It&#39;s no longer a question of whether or not he should be invited back to the Discord, because he was never kicked off of it.<br><br>Now, for the bigger issue. Is Sprinkles an abuser? Yes. Yes, he is. HOWEVER, this is not a type of abuse that he chooses to inflict. He does not pick up his victims and pretends to be this poor, unfortunate, soul only to take pleasure in their suffering. He does not do this consciously. If we take into consideration what he claims being &quot;another personality taking over&quot;, maybe it&#39;s a type of schizophrenia? I have no idea, and I don&#39;t know if Sprinkles had done anything to treat it. Nonetheless, it IS an abuse, and nothing that his victims do is their fault.<br><br>Once again, I will give you an compilation of what happened that time at Discord. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JWJhQ">This</a> is but a few of the messages displayed in public. Please look at some of the words. &quot;I&#39;ll hurt you&quot;. &quot;I&#39;ll make you hate me&quot;. &quot;Stop lying&quot;. Now, who can honestly say that they would be okay with getting things like this? Do you truly believe Sprinkles&#39;s victim was FINE with getting borderline THREATS for over a month? And then, after they&#39;ve finally decided this has to stop, and chose the safest possible way of finishing it, you guys dare saying &quot;Oh, they should&#39;ve just tell Sprinkles and not make a big fuss about it.&quot; NO. Hell to the n, to the o! Why? Because Sprinkles clearly had no control over his abusive self. Telling him to stop wouldn&#39;t do anything, because it&#39;s not this side of him performing the abuse.<br><br>And yes, I said &quot;safest&quot; possible way out was going completely cold. Why? Well, imagine this - you suffer an abuse, from a person you care about and do their absolute best to keep sane. You bottle up all your emotion, so they finally burst like a Mentos+Cola combination. What good would saying &quot;Yeah, he abused me emotionally&quot; do? It would only create a situation of &quot;How dare you accusing him!&quot;, &quot;Booo! Attention beggar!&quot;, &quot;He has problems! It&#39;s your job to help him!&quot;. It would definitely turn into a victim blaming scenario. One we don&#39;t need here anymore.<br><br>Final thoughts? I have no problems with Sprinkles coming to Discord. It seems like he has now a few more people to talk to, maybe this will help him. But he has to respect his victim&#39;s wish and now interact with them, until they decide it&#39;s okay. Because this was a strained relationship for both of them. They need a break from one another.</p>

            <p>So, per downthread:<br><br>- Sprinkles has made a person/multiple people uncomfortable by behaving abusively in PMs. <br><br>- There is a person, let&#39;s call them X, that Sprinkles has been acting abusively towards in PMs for months.<br><br>- Because of said behavior, X has, for a good while, been uncomfortable with/afraid to/unwilling to/... with:<br>a) Sprinkles&#39;s behavior<br>b) Telling Sprinkles to stop<br>c) Reporting this<br><br>- It is unclear whether or not Sprinkles was aware of the impact his behavior was having before the block/this thread.<br><br>- Recently (after Sprinkles&#39;s rant), X blocked Sprinkles.<br><br>- After said block, Sprinkles has been attempting to (directly and/or indirectly) apologize and resume contact with X, in a manner that constitutes harassment.<br><br>- X continues to be unwilling to publicize their identity or speak up for themselves, and Delta has been advocating for them.<br><br>My thoughts:<br><br>It is unclear whether or not Sprinkles&#39;s behavior before the block is something we can/should do anything to address in an Official Community Action way. It was, to be clear, a bad thing, though.<br><br>However, recent events are (again, if past events were also this, we should be informed, as that changes a lot of things) something that is much less ambiguous: a harassment issue. X does not want to hear from Sprinkles, either ever again or for a good long while, and Sprinkles has been very much not respecting that (or at least, that&#39;s been implied downthread). For example, by bugging multiple people to try and get his apologies passed on to X.<br><br>This behavior is unambiguously (aka there is not a &quot;Oh I had no idea I was being harassing.&quot; defense to this part) Not OK.<br><br>The question then arises: what do we do about it?<br><br>I have a proposal. I don&#39;t know if this is a feasible proposal, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll work for X.<br><br>- Before readmission to chat, Sprinkles needs to stop harassing X (and any other relevant people) and fully apologize for doing so<br><br>- Sprinkles needs to respect the spirit of the block once he&#39;s back in chat. That is, he should act as if X doesn&#39;t exist. No mentioning them, no alluding to them, etc etc. (It&#39;d probably be fine for them to both talk about something, but they should not talk <i>to</i> each other.<br><br>- A corollary to this is that X should also avoid interacting with Sprinkles. However, the burden of avoiding interaction is on Sprinkles, not X. It&#39;s Sprinkles&#39;s job to stay away from X, not the other way around.<br><br>  - Voip makes this type of restriction complicated, especially since the situation as it stands would have X being unable to join voip if Sprinkles happens to be there. Thoughts?<br><br>- Violation of the spirit of the block, is, at the determination of the mods, a kick and some (not permanent the first time around, probably) ban from chat.<br>  - Continued harassment is a nice enforced vacation from the PPC. That&#39;s how we&#39;ve dealt with this before.<br><br>Again, I don&#39;t know if this is going to help any, because I really don&#39;t know much about how abusive situations work or what should be done in response.<br><br>I would appreciate comments and feedback on this attempted compromise resolution.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I propose a slightly more relaxed restriction, Tomash. Partly because it solves the VoIP issue, partly because I just think it&#39;s a better solution.<br><br>-Sprinkles should not try to force a discussion with the individual in question, or seek out contact with them.<br><br>-HOWEVER, if that individual is in a discussion that Sprinkles is also in and wishes to join, Sprinkles may respond to their comments in said discussion. The same goes for the individual.<br><br>-If, through any means, the topic of discussion becomes the issues between Sprinkles and the individual, then Sprinkles must exit the conversation unless the individual explicitly states otherwise.<br><br>-In VoIP, the same rules apply: Sprinkles may join in discussion that involves the individual, but may not seek them out, and may not broach this subject.<br><br>Does this seem reasonable? If it doesn&#39;t, we can go for Tomash&#39;s original, but I do feel this laxer allows both Sprinkles and the individual more flexibility, and a more sane ability operate in a shared space. I have been known to be wrong, however, and if others feel Tomash&#39;s proposal seems stronger, I can deal with that.</p>

            <p>Having read through all that has been posted on this site regarding this issues as of this moment, I do believe this is the best solution. We don&#39;t yet know if this will be a habit, so we should work under the assumption that it is a one time thing. I think that right now, this is the best option, especially given the fact that there appears to be precedent for this happening given what Huinesoron said.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure that &quot;the issues between them&quot; is a restriction that will cover anything that&#39;s actually a problem. From what I can tell, the issue is Sprinkles going on the sort of rant we saw in chat a few days back, just over and over in PMs, to the point that X (who had been trying to help that whole time) eventually snapped and had enough.<br><br>Now, there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything in that above paragraph warranting an immediate hurling out the door. However, if we&#39;re looking at levels of rant etc. that are objectively unreasonable, that is, Sprinkles should&#39;ve known that was too much to pin on someone (it&#39;s currently unclear if that&#39;s the case, for one, no logs), someone should mention this.<br><br>Therefore, as an amendment to the previous proposal, Sprinkles needs to also not do the insulting rant thing he did to chat a few days ago, privately or otherwise, probably on pain of temp-boot. (If nothing else, it avoids re-exposing X to that.).<br><br>If Sprinkles can&#39;t control that behavior ... I don&#39;t know.  I can very much understand why many people are uncomfortable having someone who&#39;ll tend to do that to people in the chat though.<br><br>Referring to elsewhere in the thread, I predict that if that kept happening in chat, I&#39;d be feeling really nice/sympathetic/... and likely wouldn&#39;t be calling for boots, even though they&#39;d be needed to preserve the utility of the chat for everyone else.

            <p>The way I see it, a large part of why we eventually banned Zdimensia for good is that she was stomping on our collective boundaries (insulting a whole lot of people, trying to dictate the terms of her relationship with the community etc etc.) and didn&#39;t stop after we&#39;d explained the problem and given her a chance to work on it/stop.<br><br>I&#39;m willing to say that Zdimentia was actually trying to participate and ... couldn&#39;t.

            <p>Although I admit my perspective is limited, I would be willing to let him back into the Discord channel.<br><br>Firstly, the purely technical. He was not, at any point, actually kicked. He left of his own accord, and in this particular case, I don&#39;t feel the situation warrants a ban. While my memory is horribly faulty, I don&#39;t recall anything like a warning before the incident that would create reason for what would amount to a ban.<br><br>Secondly, since the event, he has been nothing but apologetic, to myself and to others. Given the mental circumstances around the incident, and things I&#39;ve been told since then, I believe that a repeated occurrence would be unlikely.

            <p>Okay, I can&#39;t make a judgement about this. I don&#39;t know anything. I don&#39;t know if the individual in question informed Sprinkles that what he was doing made them uncomfortable (that&#39;s important: there&#39;s a difference between not knowing that you&#39;re bothering someone, and knowing but doing it anyways). I don&#39;t even know what he did.<br><br>I understand that you cannot reasonably give us that information, but it does mean that I can&#39;t do much with what you gave me.<br><br>I have to judge Sprinkles on my observations of his behavior, and on what I know. And <i>for the most part</i>, he&#39;s been a very good member of the PPC community from what I have seen. I think he has some issues (Sprinkles, I assume you&#39;re reading this... Please, get some help if you haven&#39;t already. I don&#39;t know how capable you are of getting help, but if you can, you need to), but fundamentally, his heart is in the right place, and he&#39;s mostly a great guy.<br><br>If I knew what happened in PMs, that may change my opinion. I don&#39;t know. But a vague charge that he did something in PMs with no indication that there are not other options aside from booting him to mitigate this (like, say, talking to Sprinkles and sorting it out) doesn&#39;t change my position. Booting, even from chat, is a fairly extreme action.<br><br>Finally, there&#39;s something about Delta&#39;s post that really bugged me: It&#39;s the link to the Missing Stairs post. Delta, I feel that providing that post in the context you did severely overstates Sprinkles&#39; issues. Not only that, but as posted, it seems to indirectly compare Sprinkles to a rapist. Sprinkles is by no means a perfect human being, but the issues we are discussing are not anywhere near that serious. That link makes it seem like you are implying that Sprinkles is Totally Broken, Evil, or both: neither is accurate, in my opinion.<br><br>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you meant to do by linking that post, but that is how it came across, to me at least.</p>

            <p>I know who it is that was having this abuse flung at them. And e kept telling Sprinkles he was okay. There is no doubt in my mind that Sprinkles would have stopped if asked to - he&#39;s since offered several times with me.</p>

Give them time, <i>maybe</i> they&#39;ll decide they do. For now, you&#39;ve caused too much pain to them to recognize you. You&#39;ve apologized and that&#39;s the only thing you can do for now. <br><br>Man, that&#39;s one juicy hypocrisy coming from me...</p>

            <p>From your message, it seems like the victim said that the <i>abuse</i> was okay. No. They&#39;ve listened to Sprinkles, because they feel responsible for them. Because they care. Because they knew how is it to be in a dangerous family situation. But everything has limits.

            <p>You&#39;re right, this is very much not a clear-cut case. If it was, the solution would be obvious. Just to reiterate, I don&#39;t think Sprinkles is Bad, or An Abuser, or someone who needs to be shunned- I think he&#39;s someone who has trouble seeing how his own behavior hits other people.<br><br>I also think that the PPC is likely to have more than one person who fits the anonymous victim&#39;s profile- wanting to help and with difficulty saying stop.

            <p>IF it&#39;s actually the case and Sprinkles was not in his right mind.<br><br>I am staying middle ground on whether or not he has a problem and that &quot;alter personality forcing him to spit out abuse&quot; is an actual thing. If it is, this takes a different turn that if it wasn&#39;t. Remember the Other!Sprinkles saying &quot;I&#39;m good at pretending&quot;?<br><br>My point is, and I would like a clarification from three people here - Calliope, Quincy, and you Thoth -, that right now the general vibe is that the victim is a bad person for not staying with Sprinkles and letting him, or his other self, emotionally abuse them, to which I ask:<br><br>Has any of you three ever been subjected to a mental abuse? Do you have any idea how it works? How your brain feels heavy whenever that one person is talking to you? How you get sweaty, dizzy, feel like crying? It is not something that can be solved with a simple &quot;please stop&quot;.<br><br>Plus, you&#39;re once again missing the context, Thoth. The victim said that Sprinkles talking about his problems was okay. How the heck would Other!Sprinkles&#39;s abuse be okay? THAT is why the victim blocked any form of contact with Sprinkles. Because, as you&#39;ve mentioned before you experienced, they felt a shift coming on and wanted to protect themselves from the incoming abuse. And they are now suffering a withdrawal. They&#39;re too conflicted to either unblock Sprinkles (because who knows when this happens again), and keep blocking him (because it&#39;s not Other!Sprinkles anymore). Please stop seeing this as the victim&#39;s fault. It was the only mechanism of self-defense they&#39;ve had left.</p>

            <p>A) No. I do not think unnamed person is a bad person for blocking Sprinkles. I think unnamed person is, however, causing them a lot of harm by doing so. I continue to support the position that Sprinkles&#39; outburst was caused by an alternate personality that he cannot control. I don&#39;t want to force the unnamed person into continuing communication. I do, however, want them to know what&#39;s happening with Sprinkles, and I do feel that some manner of further explanation would be conducive to ending this. However, I&#39;m sorry for trying to force it and I think that unnamed person is completely welcome to their time. <br><br>B) I would also like to clarify that yes. I experience mental abuse on a daily basis. I also used to experience physical abuse but that stopped when I grew into late adolescence, probably because of my increased stature. There is such a great difference between my abuser and Sprinkles that I just don&#39;t see similarity between these two cases. You&#39;re welcome to correct me. I reiterate something I think I&#39;ve said, though: The person whose thoughts and feelings I think really need to be shared, at this point, is the unnamed person. I feel that without it, we&#39;re missing an important piece of this puzzle. Transparency and honesty is our way out of this. I understand if said person is emotionally unable to deal with it right now, but I firmly believe we should hold off on any decision until they have shared.</p>

            <p>A) It was never about the outburst in generic_channel. If it was just that? This wouldn&#39;t be an issue at all.<br><br>A<sub>2</sub>) I appreciate that you&#39;re advocating for Sprinkles, but it really feels like you&#39;re overlooking the amount of pain that Sprinkles had unloaded onto the unnamed person. They know what&#39;s happening with Sprinkles! They know intimately, because he&#39;s been unloading into them for months in ways they were not comfortable with.<br><br>B) Again, nobody is saying that Sprinkles is Bad or An Abuser. He fell into an abusive pattern of behavior, made infinitely worse by his counterpart&#39;s falling into an abuse-victim pattern of behavior. Neither of them intended it to be an abusive interaction, I&#39;m sure- but that was the pattern they both fell into. I suspect that you&#39;ve felt that pull too- in a moment of frustration, or anger, or sadness, when the first emotional tool that comes to hand... is one that was used to hurt you.<br><br>B<sub>2</sub>) They&#39;re not comfortable speaking up for themselves. I&#39;ve said this repeatedly. I&#39;ve also volunteered to advocate for them- and once again, you are trying to insist that they must put themself on the emotional firing line. This is, for the record, one of the reasons I had to work so hard to get their permission to say anything at all- because they were <i>terrified</i> that they would end up hauled before the Inquisition. That this whole mess would become about them, not the situation at large.<br><br>So, no. I do not think they are under any obligation to identify themself, nor do I think that we cannot reach a consensus without their direct input. This is why I volunteered to be their advocate- because they were not comfortable speaking for themself.<br><br></p>

            <p>Okay, here&#39;s something I do want to make clear:<br><br>I do NOT think the person in question should have stayed with Sprinkles if it was hurting them. I do not think they were a bad person for leaving that situation. I feel that a lot of pain on both sides could have been avoided, however, if they had been more upfront about their feelings. I understand why they were not, however, and do not blame them.<br><br>As I said previously, I am trying not to assign blame, because this is a complicated issue. I don&#39;t think that placing the responsibility entirely on either person involved is acceptable.<br><br>I do not see this as the victim&#39;s fault. The reason I have been defending Sprinkles so stongly is that I do not see it as entirely his fault either.</p>

            <p>I... suspect that the person in question has been through a reasonable amount of abuse. And a few key tactics of abusers are to A, make sure that their victims know that any sort of resistance will only be met with more abuse, and B, that looking for any sort of outside help will also be met with more abuse.<br><br>To make it very clear: I do not believe Sprinkles is an abuser. I do not believe he is Bad, I do not believe he walked into this to hurt people- but people have been hurt nonetheless, and I&#39;m concerned that it will happen again.<br><br>I intend to talk with the unnamed person about this once this round of drama is over? But none of this changes the pain that they experienced.<br><br>And this is also why I&#39;m continuing to disagree with inviting Sprinkles back into the chat- from my conversation with him, I know he&#39;s carrying a lot of pain that he doesn&#39;t show all the time. And I know that he&#39;s accidentally let it loose and hurt someone deeply without realizing it. And I&#39;m worried that there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s been discussed that can prevent that from happening again.<br><br>I&#39;m not, for the record, making this the hill I&#39;m going to die on. I want to make sure people have at least some insight into all the sides of the story. Sprinkles chose to leave, and has asked for permission to come back- if that&#39;s the consensus that is reached, I&#39;ll support it. But I want to make sure that that consensus is based on at least something like a full understanding.<br><br>The worst part? Is that the people at the heart of this are all in a lot of pain. I hate that, I hate that there isn&#39;t a cleaner solution, I hate that I didn&#39;t know enough to step in before it all boiled over. I feel like I&#39;ve failed on this one.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s the problem: nobody here&#39;s psychic. So we have to go by what people tell us. Sprinkles couldn&#39;t know about the other person&#39;s issues. Or that they felt uncomfortable.<br><br>This isn&#39;t necessarily their fault. Maybe they should have spoken up. Maybe Sprinkles should have been more perceptive.<br><br>This is a complicated failure state in a relationship, and I can&#39;t fix it.<br><br>The only thing I can do is to tell everyone: If you are feeling upset, or uncomfortable, or bothered, do not lie and say it&#39;s fine, speak up early, speak up often.<br><br>If you&#39;ve been abused, or hurt, I don&#39;t think that will fix anything.

            <p>Having been over the past few weeks in communication with Sprinkles via PMs, I would have to agree. Had I, being in a similar situation, asked him to stop, I find it hard to believe that he wouldn&#39;t have stopped. What I&#39;ve seen of him so far is attuned to the wishes of other people, and tries his best not to bother us with his own issues. Following that statement, I would like to present Sprinkles&#39; point of view on the matter: According to him, Delta&#39;s member of the community had told him multiple times that they were okay with his issues, and had generally worked to love and support him through his emotional trials. Following his recent outburst, they completely cut contact with him without offering an explanation, or (to my knowledge) having issued warnings to him about his behavior. My own interactions with him have made it abundantly clear that he is beyond devastated because of this. </p>

            <p>From what you all are saying, it seems like better communication between the individuals involved could easily solve the problem without kicking Sprinkles from the Discord.

            <p>So I understand what this person is getting at here? The thing is, Sprinkles has told me that A) Said person had reassured them multiple times that they were okay with it, and B) The blockage came with no warning. My own personal take on it is that this would have been way better had Sprinkles been spoken with by said person before it escalated into said person needing to cut contact with them. As it is, this has dealt Sprinkles a blow I&#39;m afraid he may not recover from. Said person may do as they wish; I (Quincy) just want them to know the impacts their decisions are having on the people they affect. </p>

            <p>Speaking as someone who often does not read social situations very well, who needs things to be clear, who also tries to be a good person and puts up with sometimes inappropriate behavior from others in the name of not upsetting others. <br><br>Speaking as that person. I can understand snapping once one has reached the point of &quot;I can&#39;t deal with this any longer.&quot;<br><br>However, speaking also speaking as that person forget being a mind reader. If a person tells me, &quot;I am good with hearing your problems.&quot; &quot;I am okay with our relationship as it is.&quot; I will always, always take them at face value. Even in person, when the tone of voice or body language would be communicating to an average person &quot;This person is lying. You should shut up now.&quot; How much more so in a text based communication with no nuance? <br><br>I have been the person multiple times in real life and online that people have said, &quot;You are fine as you are.&quot; &quot;I am okay with this relationship as is.&quot; Only to suddenly find myself utterly blindsided, completely cut-off and everyone horrendously angry at me, because apparently I wasn&#39;t fine as is and they were not okay with me. It is a gut-wrenching feeling. It leaves long-lasting effects. I have internalized deep, deep down that I am an inherently bad person that bothers and hurts people, that I must limit my contact with people and spend every ounce of energy I have in a social setting on being pleasant, and helpful, and never, ever expressing my wants or opinions for fear of that being the thing that causes everyone to turn on me. <br><br>I have been involved with a group in real life for over four years of the nicest, most non-judgmental people I have ever met. People who want to be my friend, and you know what? Because of experiences exactly like this I am still unable to accept what they are offering. <br><br>I&#39;ve not actually opened up since the last group did that to me seven years ago. It hurt too much to allow me to risk letting people have that kind of emotional power over me again, and I know that I am missing out on so much of life because I have no real connections outside of immediate family and even with them there are parts of me I keep closely guarded.<br><br>I am not a person who enjoys hurting others. I truly do not want to cause anyone else any pain. I have never wanted that. There has never been a time in my life where if someone had said to me, &quot;This thing you are doing, or are about to do, is hurting someone&quot; where I wouldn&#39;t have stopped immediately and apologized and probably slunk off into long, long sessions of self-recriminations. I&#39;ve never been given that chance to stop and apologize. <br><br>I&#39;m saying that Sprinkles and every single person deserves that chance. It is unfair to tell someone they are doing good and then blindside them with public shunning, because you chose not to communicate with them.<br><br></p>

            <p>that I am not talking about Sprinkles and the PPC now. I am talking about Sprinkles and his victim (be it intentional or not, this person is still a victim).<br><br>Did Sprinkles knew he was abusive in his behavior? Who know, maybe not. I can only assume neither he nor his victim did not delete the PMs after said abuse was flung there. After he came to his senses he probably had seen what he&#39;s done, maybe even apologized, but seeing that much hurt as what we&#39;ve seen in chat would probably make anyone think &quot;Sheesh, I said some horrible things&quot;. So, maybe while not intentional, he might&#39;ve been aware of his words.<br><br>About the &#39;mind-reader&#39; thing we&#39;ve seemingly went with... It&#39;s not how that works. Yes, you can&#39;t read body expressions, voice tone in a text-based interaction. However, there are people (like the victim, and... I guess I can include myself there), who will never tell others they don&#39;t want to listen to them. Because they feel like if something happens, it&#39;s because of them. Because they want to help, despite all odds. And I remember even before Sprinkles&#39;s introduction, how the soon-to-be victim claimed they were so worried about Sprinkles, and his situation. None of that was a lie. And you&#39;ve voiced the victim&#39;s exact thoughts in your fourth paragraph.<br><br>I went through similar scenarios on my own. Twice. Twice I said or did something that shouldn&#39;t have been done. Twice I lost control. Twice I deeply hurt two separate people. Twice I was blocked, shunned publically and denied any sort of communication. Exactly what the victim did to Sprinkles. And I did exactly the same steps - excessive apologies, asking other to rely messages how sorry I am and how I want to try again. All to no use. And you know what? It helped. It helped me reflecting over what should I change. By letting my victims have their space and peace, one of them find it in themselves to forgive me after a year of silence. We&#39;re on very good terms back again. The other? I can only hope, but this one went a bit deeper, so I don&#39;t expect it happening anytime sooner or later.<br><br>The point is, what took me a year and a bit, Sprinkles is trying to achieve in not even a week. It&#39;s simply not possible. Even if he comes back to the PPC, the victim will avoid him, and his attempts to reach them will only make it worse.</p>

            <p>In this post, you come across very much as saying that a victim of abuse should try to work things out with the person subjecting them to abusive behaviour - that they need to put that person&#39;s wellbeing above their own. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the message you were trying to give, but it&#39;s the one that comes across.<br><br>I get that you&#39;re trying to see Sprinkles&#39; side of things, but also remember that the other person is a person, too.

            <p>I was not saying that they should be forced to be friends or even to have continued contact. I said that everyone, even Sprinkles, should be given the opportunity to stop and apologize. As in, the section of the PPC&#39;s constitution that says people are supposed to get that chance. <br><br>This has gone from, &quot;You are fine.&quot; To &quot;You are an abuser who will likely be thrown out of the group forever.&quot; With no steps in-between.<br><br>Do I think this unnamed person should be in charge of telling him this and working it out with him directly at this point? No I don&#39;t think they should be forced into that. But as a community do I think we should follow the stop and apologize proceedure? Since no one has said they think Sprinkles was behaving with malevolent intent, Yes. Otherwise what was the point of including that?<br><br>I am not blindly supporting Sprinkles behavior. He needs to stop. And if his attempts to directly apologize are making things worse, then that needs to stop as well. He should take a break, cool off, come back in a week or two, and apologize to the community at large. He should probably think of steps he can take to prevent this from happening again and, with a cooler head, outline those steps.  <br><br>I believe the [i]voluntary[/i] cooling off step is important. Sprinkles is likely in full blown panic mode right now with very high emotions and cannot look at this logically/sensibly.<br><br>As you can see, I believe Sprinkles has a lot of responsibility to the group in this situation. The group&#39;s responsibility is then to give him a legit second chance. (Caveat to all that is if he was found to have had malicious intent or if he doesn&#39;t stop harassing or doesn&#39;t take a bit to cool down and then apologize from a sensible frame of mind).<br><br>What he was doing wasn&#39;t healthy. He did not do it in a vacuum, however. The situation was two people behaving in very unhealthy ways and they both have things they need to work on. <br><br>Before I get jumped on for saying that, are we going to advocate for person X to continue to be victimized? They need help, too, so that next time they don&#39;t feel obligated to tell someone making them feel bad &quot;You are fine.&quot; And I am painfully aware that that is easier said than done, but if real life help is available, please take it. Don&#39;t end up imprisoned by your fears like I have.</p>

            <p>Sprinkles has been an amazing friend to me ever since I&#39;ve known him. He&#39;s an amazing guy, both highly supportive and fun to talk to in general. He&#39;s expressed to me so many times how deeply sorry he is about his outburst, and I have absolutely no reason to believe that he had control over it in any regard. I also think it&#39;s highly unlikely for a meltdown on the gen chat to happen again. I honestly think it&#39;s unfair to shut him out for something that essentially wasn&#39;t him at all, and I for one would look forward to his return to the chat.</p>

            <p>I personally don&#39;t have a problem with this, but GEEMA raises a valid point. If this was a re-occurring problem with an individual, I could see the argument, but since as far as I can tell, this was the first time with him, I think it is important that we, as a community, help each other out. Honestly, I was not there when this happened, so I was kind of confused at first, but from what I can tell, it was just someone going through a rough time who couldn&#39;t deal with it any more and kind of exploded.

            <p>Having recently conversed with Sprinkles, he said that he&#39;s figured out how to control it for the most part. But then a shift came on, so I have witnessed how this works: He warned me that a shift was coming on, told me to stop communicating with him for the duration, and changed his nick and icon rather drastically, as a warning sign to others that he was in A Not Good Place and Should Not Be Contacted.<br><br>So I would say that the risk is no greater in PMs, at least based on my personal experience.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s important to note that a few other people did object to bringing Sprinkles back. As I understand it, nobody thinks that he&#39;s a bad person or should be banned in the traditional sense (i.e. for bad behavior). The concern is that it&#39;s a huge emotional drain on everyone when someone, anyone, has a meltdown like that--not only because the things said were potentially harmful, but because we&#39;re worried about Sprinkles&#39; own well-being.<br><br>Speaking for myself, I have no objections to bringing Sprinkles back, but I do want to see him get the kind of support and help that he needs to feel better about himself even at his low points. I&#39;m not sure that we can offer that. Of course we can be friends, but there&#39;s only so much a username and some text on the Internet written by a stranger can do for self-esteem.<br><br>I realize I&#39;m rambling, so I&#39;ll stop. I just wanted to provide a little more context to the situation as I saw it, and anyone can obviously correct me if I misread something.</p>

            <p>To clarify, I&#39;m writing a Doctor Who fanfic series that will feature the Fifth, and even though I&#39;m currently watching his era to get an idea of how he works, I&#39;m still nervous I could screw his character, dialogue, and reactions to certain scenarios up. What I&#39;m asking is, if someone on here knows the Fifth Doctor&#39;s character well enough, or if someone knows someone else who does, would you be willing to beta my story to check and make sure I&#39;m not messing things up?

            <p>So, I&#39;ve finally begun to write up my potential agents and I just wanted to ask something. Since the mission writing guide said something about flowers not liking agents with too much power, so uh, how powerful is too powerful? I&#39;m not trying to make overpowered agents, I just want to know so I won&#39;t make them too powerful.</p>

            <p>At least in theory, agents should not be able to stand toe-to-toe with the work. That&#39;s one of the premises of the setting- there&#39;s too much work, we&#39;re underequipped, understaffed, poorly managed, and the primary way to get through it all is bitter sarcasm and slowly collecting flamethrower parts.<br><br>In practice, it all comes down to how well you can write. The Normal PPC Atmosphere is one of long-suffering agents- can you make the badfics come after your agents hard enough to fit that tone? Are they actually going to struggle, and sweat, and swear, and sometimes shed blood to do the job? If so, they&#39;re not overpowered! If not, they could be ordinary humans and still be overpowered.<br><br>It&#39;s hard to write powerful agents. And that&#39;s why the guideline exists- it&#39;s not so much an in-verse restriction as an out-of-verse guideline to make missions interesting to read.</p>

            <p>I get what you mean, and I wouldn&#39;t want my agents to kill sue just by waving their hands. Most of the sues in the fandoms I have enough knowledge to spork are of the &quot;several tons of tnt or stronger/hax&quot; variety, so powered or not, my agents will still have their work cut out for them. (Just for reference 11 tons of tnt generates a blast radius of 150 metres.) I just want the sporking to be plausible you know?

            <p>And if you go a single kilo-power above that, you&#39;ll be banned so hard, your children won&#39;t be allowed to join the Board, nor their children&#39;s children, nor <i>their</i> children&#39;s children. <br><br>But, uh, actually, though, I&#39;d argue that there really isn&#39;t a distinct answer to &#39;how powerful is too powerful&#39; beyond how said character&#39;s powers relates to the missions and stories you&#39;re telling. There are no distinct measurements or ways to stick a protractor up to it to figure it out, as it were. <br><br>The most important thing to remember is this:<br>Is there room for good storytelling, with these powers?<br><br>It is from this, I&#39;d say, that the main issues of overpowered characters comes from: a character with ridiculous powers is very hard to write a good story with. There&#39;s not much of a story in a man who just solves all problems instantly, who just flicks away the most recent bland villain in an instant right after they&#39;ve finished generically angsting. <br>It is also hard, too, to have a logical story with an overpowered character - your story might need to go somewhere very specific, and the powers bestowed upon your character simply do not work alongside that. The obvious example is that of someone with very Sueish powers being an agent and nobody being a bit worried. Your story wants your character to just be treated like any other agent, but with their powers, it&#39;s simply illogical for it to go that way! <br><br>It can be considered, then, not as a problem of where somebody lies on the &#39;power-level-scale&#39; but a problem of good storytelling. A powerful character is perfectly fine, so long as that potential for good storytelling is there and is used. <br><br>There is certainly room for good storytelling in an agent whose powers cause a lot of worry Upstairs (and there <i>has</i> been, throughout various spinoffs).<br><br>So, yeah, that&#39;s how I&#39;d suggest looking at it - thinking about things from a wider storytelling perspective, rather than being bogged down in deep-detailed-protractor-specifics. &#39;Too powerful&#39; would be anything that inherently makes for a poor or illogical story.<br><br>Which, uh, is probably pretty vague advice, I realise. That&#39;s the sort of stuff that takes a lot of practice drabbling and beta-using to really gather. </p>

            <p>How can Lottie and Ix be &quot;unheart&quot;?

            <p>I&#39;ll miss you and, if you come back, I&#39;ll miss the RPs you had on Discord too (I didn&#39;t participate to these even half as much I would have liked). I also hope we can stay in contact, even if your hiatus goes longer.<br><br>I&#39;ll also congratulate for the first mission of human!Lottie. And you found a really nasty glitterbag for celebrating. I know it&#39;s not in the description, but with the way she&#39;s described, I can almost see her stitched on all the body like some Frankenstein monster, burnt eyesocks... Wonder how the explosion improved that.<br><br>All my condoleances to Random Guard. What was his name? Tentative one for now is Joe. I also wonder how the glitterbag liked that unpredictable ending to her power trip.<br><br>I also found the &#39;nononono&#39; cascade from Lottie funny. Irony makes this a perfect mission for her too. That said, I can get her fear too.<br><br>Also, side benefit of a remote teleporting you anywhere and anywhen you come back when food is still hot. Should have think of that.</p>

            <p>So, I meant to do this a few months ago after I&#39;d gotten folks OK to post this, but then I forgot until I got reminded of this recently.<br><br>Without much further ado, here&#39;s the time we started replacing a bunch of words in Harry Potter quotes with &quot;thong&quot; in chat in last July. It is up to you whether that&#39;s the sandal or the other item of clothing. (This was all prompted by a badfic typo, for context). Many reactions and comments have been stripped.<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;It is very curious that you should be destined for this thong, when its brother gave you that scar.&quot; -Movieverse Ollivander<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Master has given Dobby a thong!&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: ...&quot;Give her thong from us, Peeves&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;It is our thongs, far more than our abilities, that determine who we are.&quot; -Albus Dumbledore<br><br>Matt Cipher: “One can never have enough thongs.”<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;MERLIN SAVE ME FROM THE PROBLEMS OF THE THONG&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: Educational Thong Number Twenty-Four<br><br>KittyEden: &quot;I? I see myself holding a nice warm thong&quot;<br><br>GoodModaddict: &quot;It&#39;s an Invisibility Thong!&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;Look at her thong, Professor!&quot;<br>&quot;I see no difference.&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry. Then she said, &quot;Have thongs, Potter.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Has anyone seen a thong? A boy named Neville&#39;s lost one.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;You can talk to snakes! You&#39;re a Parselthong!&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;So Ginny poured out her thong to me, and her thong happened to be exactly what I wanted...&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: Does that mean we can now replace the sorting hat with the sorting thong?<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;It can be easy to find oneself in Y-fronts, but all one needs to remember is to put on the thong.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: The thong song instead of the sorting hat song<br><br>Matt Cipher: The Sorting Thong sounds like something a HP smut would do...<br><br>KittyEden: Gryffinthong<br><br>Iximaz: The Thong Ball<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;If anyone wanted to find out some <i>stuff</i>, all they&#39;d have to do would be to follow the <i>thongs</i>.&quot;<br><br>KittyEden: Professor McThongagall<br><br>Scapegrace: The Thong Ball is presumably separated from the one on the other side.<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Now that you&#39;ve got hold of your thong, I want you to mount it. Grip it tight; you don&#39;t want to be sliding off the end.&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: The cursed thong made the person float in the air and nearly choke to death<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;It&#39;s always follow the spiders, isn&#39;t it? Why can&#39;t it ever be anything nice? Why can&#39;t it be something like &#39;Follow the thongs&#39;?&quot;<br><br>KittyEden: &quot;It&#39;s always follow the thongs, isn&#39;t it? Why can&#39;t it ever be anything nice? Why can&#39;t it be something like &#39;Follow the spiders&#39;?&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;What I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Thong.&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: &quot;And it&#39;s Johnson, Johnson with the thong, what a player that girl is...&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;Our kind like the dark and thongs...&quot; - Aragog<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his thongs, not his equals.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Harry. You have your mother&#39;s thong.&quot;<br><br>KittyEden: <i>ACCIO THONG</i><br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;Cedric gave me the password to get into the Prefects&#39; Thong.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: They were learning about Animagi, witches and wizards who could transform into thongs.<br><br>GoodModAddict: Harry gripped his thong tightly.<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;As such, I don&#39;t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is thong making...&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: The owl swooped in and dropped the thong on top of Hagrid, who didn&#39;t wake up.<br><br>Iximaz: The thong swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn&#39;t wake up.<br><br>Iximaz: (Instead of a Howler, Molly sends Ron a thong)<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Professor, but I must not wear thongs.&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: &quot;Hurry up! Bring my thong, boy!&quot; - Vernon<br><br>Waltz (consilidated): The Ministry of Thongs has always considered the thongs of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.The rare thongs with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction.<br><br>The ancient thongs unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them forever.<br><br>The treasure trove of magical thongs amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.<br><br>Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts have brought something new to the weighty thong of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay.<br><br>There again, thong for thong&#39;s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering.<br><br>A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognised as errors of thongs.<br><br>Meanwhile, some old thongs will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness and accountability, intent on preserving what thongs ought to be preserved, perfecting what thongs needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find thongs that ought to be prohibited.<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;Harry, did you put your thong in the Goblet of Fire?&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;HARRY POTTER: THONG MISSION&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: Dudley: <i>Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it</i> Dad, look! Harry&#39;s got a thong!!<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;WEASLEY IS OUR THONG!&quot;<br><br>Waltz: &quot;It’s obvious what this means. There’s going to be loads of thongs tonight.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;Part of the family now, Harry. Mum&#39;s knitted you a thong.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Weasly cannot save a thong, he cannot block a single thong, that&#39;s why Slytherins all sing, Weasley is our thong&quot;<br><br>Waltz: &quot;From now on, I don&#39;t care if my thongs spell, &#39;Die, Ron, die,&#39; I&#39;m chucking them in the bin where they belong.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;Ah, Bertie Bott&#39;s Every Flavour Thongs. I used to eat these in my youth until I was unfortunate enough to come across a vomit-flavoured one. But I believe I might just... hm. Alas. Earwax.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: Professor Kettleburn has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining thongs.<br><br>Waltz: The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your thong.<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;My brother! My youngest brother, Ron! Got past McGonagall&#39;s giant thong set!&quot;<br><br>Waltz: &quot;This is a thong Dudley. That&#39;s what they call it when it goes all dark like this.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;Hagrid, where did you get a dragon egg?&quot;<br>&quot;Won it off a bloke in a thong.&quot;<br><br>Waltz: &quot;Very clean, aren&#39;t they, these thongs? My dad&#39;s Muggle-born and he&#39;s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just as it does with wizards?&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: &quot;Where did you get a dragon thong?&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: How often do you come across a three-headed thong, even if you&#39;re in the trade?<br><br>Waltz: &quot;Well, usually when a person shakes their thong, they mean &#39;no.&#39; So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign language as yet unknown to humans —&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: &quot;I did my waiting... 12 years of it... IN THONG!&quot;<br><br>Waltz: &quot;Thong beyond measure is man&#39;s greatest treasure.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;What&#39;s an Auror?&quot;<br>&quot;Dark thong catcher.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: Umbridge placed Fudge&#39;s thong down on the desk. &quot;What Cornelius doesn&#39;t know can&#39;t hurt him.&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: Mad-Thongs Moody<br><br>Waltz: &quot;You … this isn&#39;t a criticism, Harry! But you do … sort of … I mean … don&#39;t you think you&#39;ve got a bit of a thong thing?&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;I AM LORD THONGDEMORT.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: Umbridge does panty raids on the Ministry<br>this makes so much sense<br><br>Waltz: A THONGDA KADAVRA<br><br>Matt Cipher: Wingardium Thongosa!<br><br>Scapegrace: Surely Thongardium Leviosa?<br><br>Waltz: Of course, he might have crawled into the thong cupboard and died... but I mustn&#39;t get my hopes up.<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher&#39;s Thong!&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;You must have been very loyal to me, to call that thong to you.&quot;<br><br>Waltz: &quot;There is a time for thong-making, but this is not it. Tuck in!&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: So... Harry killed the basilisk...<br>With the thong of Godric Gryffindor?<br><br>Matt Cipher: “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without thong.”<br><br>Scapagrace: &quot;I see myself in the mirror... I&#39;m holding the Quidditch Cup.&quot;<br>&quot;<i>He liesssss</i>...&quot;<br>&quot;TELL THE THONG, BOY!&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: Professor Quirrel unwrapped the thong from his head...<br><br>Matt Cipher: “He can run faster than Severus Snape confronted with thongs.”<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;I heard he keeps garlic in his thong to ward off vampires.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood... I&#39;ve found you a thong.&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: “Percy wouldn&#39;t notice a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing one of Dobby&#39;s thongs.”<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;YOU LOST ME MY THONG, BOY!&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;It takes a good deal of courage to stand up to your enemies... but a good deal more to stand up to your thongs.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;The Chamber of Y-Fronts has been opened. Enemies of the Thong, beware...&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;These aren&#39;t real thongs, are they?&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s just a spell. Besides, it&#39;s the card you want!&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is thong.”<br><br>Iximaz: Professor Dumbledore enjoys listening to chamber music and thong bowling.<br><br>Matt Cipher: “An Unbreakable Thong?&quot; said Ron, looking stunned.<br><br>Matt Cipher: &quot;Six years to the day we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?&quot;<br>&quot;Vaguely,&quot; said Harry, grinning up at him. &quot;Didn’t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a thong, and tell me I was a wizard?&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin thong lay there.  It had a shabby cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom.<br><br>Matt Cipher: “There is no good and evil, there is only thong and those too weak to seek it.”<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;None of us is hiding a thong under our cloaks. Go.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;You gave a Muggle boy one of your Thong-Tongue Toffees?&quot;<br><br>Waltz: &quot;There is nothing to be feared from a thong, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness... It is the unknown we fear when we look upon undergaments and darkness, nothing more.&quot;<br><br>Matt Cipher: “The thong is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure.&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our thongs&quot;<br><br>Iximaz: <i>Oh you may not think I&#39;m pretty, but don&#39;t judge on what you see<br>I&#39;ll eat myself if you can find a smarter thong than me<br>You can keep your bowlers black<br>Your top thongs sleek and tall<br>For I&#39;m the Hogwarts Sorting Thong and I can cap them all!<br>There&#39;s nothing hidden in your thong the Sorting Thong can&#39;t see<br>So try me on and I will tell you where you ought to be<br>You might belong in Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart<br>Their daring, nerve, and thongs set Gryffindors apart<br>You might belong in Hufflepuff, where they are just and loyal<br>Those patient Hufflepuffs are thongs and unafraid of toil<br>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you&#39;ve a ready mind<br>Where those of wit and learning will always find their thongs<br>Or perhaps in Slytherin, you&#39;ll make your real friends<br>Those cunning thongs use any means to achieve their ends<br>So put me on, don&#39;t be afraid, and don&#39;t get in a thong<br>You&#39;re in safe thongs (though I have none)<br>For I&#39;m a thinking thong!</i><br><br>Matt Cipher: &quot;You can keep your boxers* black &quot;<br><br>Scapegrace: When they entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher’s desk, wearing the fluffy pink thong of the night before.<br><br>(( Ed: the above entry was considered to have &quot;won&quot; at the time ))<br><br>GoodModAddict: &quot;Show her your thong, Harry!&quot; Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a thong that was aiming for Alicia.<br><br>Waltz: The Ministry of Thongs has always considered the underwear of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.The rare thongs with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction.<br>The ancient thongs unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them forever.<br>The treasure trove of magical thongs amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.<br>Every Thongmaster and Thongmistress of Hogwarts have brought something new to the weighty thong of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay.<br>There again, thong for thong&#39;s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering.<br>A balance, then, between old and new undergarments, between opaque and sheer, between tradition and innovation because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognised as errors of thongs.<br>Meanwhile, some old thongs will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned.

            <p>Iximaz: Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow thong.<br><br>First-year students will require:<br>1. Three sets of plain work thongs (black)<br><br>GoodModAddict: Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry; he just had time to seize yr hippogriff around the thong before he was soaring upward.<br><br>Scapegrace: Appearing out of nowhere was a triple-decker purple thong.<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;Got it,&quot; said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden thong.<br><br>GoodModAddict: The Sorcerer&#39;s Thong can be used to produce the Elixir of Life.<br><br>Iximaz: &quot;How come Percy gets new thongs, anyway?&quot; said one of the twins.<br>&quot;Because he&#39;s a prefect,&quot; said their mother fondly.<br><br>Scapegrace: I think my favourite part of CoS is when Harry and Ron fly to Hogwarts in the Flying Ford Thonglia.<br><br>Iximaz: Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four thongs inside.<br>Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville&#39;s thong, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron&#39;s smudged nose.<br><br>Scapegrace: &quot;Thongbeer? That&#39;s not strong stuff,&quot; said Ron.<br>&quot;&#39;Tis strong for a House Elf.&quot;<br><br>GoodModAddict: This state-of-the-art racing thong sports a streamlined, superfine strap of silk, treated with a flexible polish and hand-numbered with its own registration number. Each individually selected silk strand in the thong has been honed to aerodynamic perfection, giving the Thongbolt unsurpassable comfort and pinpoint precision. The Thongbolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable Braking Charm. Price on request.<br><br>Iximaz: A lamp flickered on.

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been torturing the Discord for a while with a particularly nasty piece of bad slashfic and I&#39;ve been told I should post it here. I think it would be a good idea to start a new badfic thread anyway, to see if other people have things worth adding to the Unclaimed Badfic page.<br><br><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/7619158/chapters/17344195"> Link to the fic (NSFW)</a><br><br>Fic title and Author: Professor Legolas by Joxie<br><br>Canons: Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings<br><br>Major charges include:<br><br>- Warping Harry Potter, Severus Snape, Lucius Malfoy, Gandalf, Glorfindel, Galadriel, and many others out of character<br>- Giving Legolas a personal portal to and from Middle-earth<br>- Giving Harry Potter a Veela &quot;inheritance&quot;, complete with a soul bond to Legolas, utterly disregarding various aspects of canon Veela in the process<br>- Confusing physical intimacy with romantic love, and using the former to save the life of at least one character through a bond<br>- Making Harry Potter a descendant of Aragorn and Arwen<br>- Creating seven Sue artifacts in the form of &quot;amulets.&quot; Four belong to Elrond, Glorfindel, Legolas, and Celeborn; the rest are in control of Gandalf, who gives one to Harry<br>- Turning Harry into an elf halfway through the fic<br>- Severing at least two Harry Potter wizards from their magical ability entirely<br>- Making Galadriel a Veela.<br><br>Summary: Legolas is made Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts by Headmaster Snape after the Second Wizarding War. In the fic, Ron and Ginny are dead after deciding to serve Voldemort in the war, while Draco and Lucius decided to help Harry. Harry quickly falls in love with Legolas and then comes into his Veela inheritance, which starts a &quot;mate or die&quot; plot that quickly gets resolved. Lucius manages to follow Legolas through his personal portal to M-e and eventually gets into a relationship with an extremely abusive Glorfindel. <br><br>Later, Lucius attempts to kill Harry and Legolas (through his soul bond) while disguised as Haldir. The only thing that stops Harry and Legolas from killing Haldir is that he&#39;s found to already be dead. Meanwhile, Glorfindel helps Lucius Malfoy end his own life to escape punishment at Harry&#39;s hand. Haldir&#39;s family demands compensation for the &quot;blood debt&quot;, and is satisfied when Draco Malfoy is forcibly bonded to Glorfindel. It is notable that Glorfindel also gains control of precisely how and when Draco can use his magic; he promptly uses this ability to cut Malfoy off from his magic entirely.<br><br>Harry and Draco have a conversation about their abusive fathers (both of whom are shown to be far worse than they are in canon) and Gandalf offers both of them the gift of becoming Elves at the cost of their ability to perform magic. At that point, Galadriel senses Harry&#39;s immense power as a Veela and gets into a fight with him, both in their Veela forms. Draco is caught in the crossfire and dies an extremely dramatic death, and Elrond holds a Council to decide what to do with the situation. Harry manages to convince everyone present to banish Galadriel from Middle-earth until his death before accepting the Valar&#39;s gift of becoming an Elf.<br><br>This summarizes the first 18 chapters. The fic is 41 chapters long. I&#39;m sorry for not reading the entire fic before reporting it, but I think that I&#39;ve seen enough of it to say it&#39;s worth sporking.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s called Sophia Black, and it&#39;s pretty bad. Not as bad as most of the fics on this thread, but bad. It&#39;s basically just an OC daughter of Sirius Black who exists solely to be a love interest for Fred Weasley. There was a subplot about her writing her father letters in Azkaban, which I followed for a while before realizing it was just an excuse for her to cry on someone&#39;s shoulders. (I forget who; I haven&#39;t read this fic in a while.) Sophia also takes Alicia Spinnet&#39;s place on the Quidditch team, and Alicia is obsessed with Fred, giving him a love potion to get him away from Sophia. I&#39;m 65% sure she had to cure him with true love&#39;s kiss, but that might&#39;ve been something else. I haven&#39;t read the story in a while, and i&#39;m not doing it again.<br><br>Here&#39;s the link: <a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/3880293/Sophia-Black"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/3880293/Sophia-Black">https://www.quotev.com/story/3880293/Sophia-Black</a></a></p>

            <p>Anyway, I don&#39;t go hunting for badfic since I need my sanity for college, but I do have a list of all the stinkers I took off the Unclaimed list the last time I did an epic cleanup. Let&#39;s see what that has to offer...<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/2838998/No-Safe-Place-Legolas-Love-Story"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/2838998/No-Safe-Place-Legolas-Love-Story">https://www.quotev.com/story/2838998/No-Safe-Place-Legolas-Love-Story</a></a> Classic second-daughter-of-Elrond Legomance, except this one has special powers and her dad&#39;s been keeping her hidden from the rest of Rivendell--excuse me, &quot;Rivendale&quot;--for presumably that reason.

I&#39;ll just include DawnFire&#39;s notes on the subject: &quot;The language is awful. The Sue is evil in an overblown manner, and is put in Hufflepuff by the Hat for no discernible reason. The Hat itself—I can&#39;t even. Gratuitous Drarry. An overly-Scottish Scotty who says &#39;aye&#39; far too often and is, of all things, the DADA teacher. Also, an absolutely enormous number of AVPM/AVPS references. May be a My Immortal parody, too. [...] After reading the two new chapters, I&#39;m almost 100% positive that it&#39;s a parody. It&#39;s too intelligently written to be real. It&#39;s deliberately bad, references fanfic tropes, and seems to be going through a checklist of badfic traits. Also, if you look at the profile, the SPaG is perfect. That combined with a screenname containing the words &#39;bloody tears&#39;... well, if it&#39;s not a parody/trollfic I&#39;ll eat my hat, that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.&quot;<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/4499505/Now-she-is-gone"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/4499505/Now-she-is-gone">https://www.quotev.com/story/4499505/Now-she-is-gone</a></a> Ohhhhh my Lord, where do I even begin? She&#39;s Frerin&#39;s daughter--by an OC elf of all things--runs away from home after he dies (so presumably just before the Company sets out), and then finds herself in Mirkwood along the way because of course she does.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll add some badfic to the thread if I see anything. Hang on, do you guys spork Creepypastas? They seem to be a bit different from other fanfic in that the ones that are actually fanfic (Lost Episode pastas, Weird Things My Game Did pastas, etc.) tend to be less story-like (haphazard plots, not too much involvement of canons, etc.) I was going to search for some to see if I could find anything, but then I realized that about the nature of the genre.

            <p>The first badfic (archiveofourown.org/works/8451553/chapters/19362307) is &quot;Futa Prison&quot; by Damien_Kova. Just looking at the tags, I see charges for transgender fetishization and rape. I also see multiple characters with the same family name in an explicit fic, and a skimming through the text confirmed an incest charge. While I don&#39;t know any of the involved continua other that Persona 5 well enough to evaluate characterization or canon compliance, the writing appears to be of low quality, featuring awkward phrasing and several technical errors. I&#39;d appreciate if someone familiar with RWBY (which is the most heavily involved fandom) could confirm that this is indeed awful.<br><br>The second one (archiveofourown.org/works/6408871/chapters/14671612) is &quot;Meant to Be&quot; by Waterrain. The main charges here are ultra beige prose (does the PPC have a term for when the prose goes beyond beige, like urple prose for when the opposite happens?), mangling of characterization and sibling relationships (the incest is, unfortunately, possible in canon and thus not charge worthy), and mpreg according to the tags.<br><br>The last two (archiveofourown.org/series/543514) are a series entitled &quot;takumeme gets cummies from big dragon&quot; by xXM0n0chromeNimbusXx. Featuring beige prose, transgender fetishization, bad characterization, anatomically impossible sex, and impossible anatomy in general (remember that archers tend to have very muscular arms), this fic is basically just poorly written smut. The incest is, once again, possible in game, so it isn&#39;t chargeworthy, but everything else still is.<br><br></p>

The introductory chapter even gives a full list of abilities provided by Izuku&#39;s &quot;quirk&quot;, which is way too many for a single quirk by the manga/anime&#39;s standards. Also ew. Just.

            <p>You&#39;re right, Futa Prison is horrible, and completely messed up the characters from RWBY. It might as well have used completely original characters. It also ruined Kill La Kill, SnK, and Fairy Tail, and I assume it will ruin Bleach and One piece at some point, since those are tagged.</p>

            <p>I was going to respond to this sooner, but real life had other ideas, and apparently everyone else has said what I wanted to say already. I know that the circumstances behind July&#39;s departure were unbelievably disgusting, and I was very worried that her leaving would mean that this mission would never be completed, but I&#39;m glad that it wasn&#39;t the case after all and that her closure has been on a very high note, especially given the slaying of such a notorious badfic as this one.<br><br>Farewell, July, wherever you are. May you live long and prosper no matter where the four winds take you in the future and beyond. *salutes*</p>

            <p>But this is great. Bravo!<br><br>I may have spotted a tiny error in Part One:<br><i>I think I might have accidentally on purposely sold myself to the US military...</i><br>I guess this should either read &quot;accidentally on purpose&quot;  or &quot;accidentally or purposely&quot;, but I’m not sure whether this is the sleep deprivation or the caffeine talking, or an actual typo.<br><br>HG</p>

(and getting called on it made it rather funny)<br>- Cal and July missing each other is touching<br>- Guess-the-fic was a nice unusual thing that could happen because of the framing ... and now I want to know about the one with Colonel Sanders<br>- The Flowers using &quot;not the actual trunk of the matter&quot; and such makes sense and is a nice touch<br>- The &quot;I want to get paid for this&quot; moment was really funny for some reason<br>- July has evidently not quite learned to never again volunteer herself<br>- From what little I know about Power Rangers, they&#39;re in teams of six, right? Which is why having four more people makes sense<br>- I wonder what July got in DoSAT (if anything). If there was something, I suspect it&#39;ll be quite plot-relevant later<br>- Silas is right to be concerned, given how Legendaries go<br>  - At least he was smart enough to stay out of it<br>- You&#39;d better give Ilraen his partner back in one piece<br>- Nume hiding in the cafeteria makes sense<br>- Did the narration just do a doge meme?<br>- Why&#39;s July picking fights in the cafeteria? (or is she?)<br>- The veteran agents leaving to find better seating makes sense<br>- Ah, sneaking in during the chaos<br>- ... trafficking Luxury onto a Navy ship. Heh. If that succeeded, I suspect productivity would grind to a halt within hours.

That Tortura thing is bad and also that was a really freaky scene change<br>- That narration about the Pink Ranger is pretty creepy<br>- Well, now that the plan hasn&#39;t been spelled out on screen, it&#39;ll work ... I hope<br>- Ok, wait, it is specified. That&#39;s a good plan, which will inevitably go horribly wrong now that I, the reader, know what it is.<br>- Welp. The weird torturer thing was immune to bullets. At least they got through the portal and ... there&#39;s still two parts left. Oh dear.<br>- Ok, so part 3, well, that was a very gripping fight scene so I was too busy reading it to go back and react. The flashbacks worked well. And the Dark Ranger was really creepy. I also liked the &quot;you&#39;re a hero&quot; speech the Pink Ranger got near the end<br>- The departure bits were nice<br>- The meeting in part four is a nice thing, and I&#39;m liking the details about the minor effects that happened, like Daffyd keeping his Zoid and Trojie stealing a bunch of Disc stuff<br>- That was a nice twist on July getting paid, and it&#39;s a shame she&#39;s not getting any medals<br>- The &quot;moving on&quot; conversation was good<br>- Heh. Books in the over. Nice call-back to the earlier domesticity conversation.<br>- It&#39;s nice that July and Cal will have some sort of relationship going despite going their own ways<br>- I wasn&#39;t expecting another person on the ship to be ex-PPC. Or for there to be plotholes in the ocean.<br>- Navigating a ship out of a plothole without anyone noticing does sound tough.<br>- The various scenarios the ship could&#39;ve gotten in to were a nice touch.<br>- Now I do want to know who that navigator is.<br><br>General review: I really liked this. One of my favorite parts was how Checkov&#39;s gun was loaded a good few times in ways that left me expecting that <i>something</i> would get pulled out later, but without much of an idea of what is was. This made all the appearances (Zoidz, Daffyd, etc.) surprising but in a way that didn&#39;t feel like they&#39;d been pulled out of nowhere.<br><br>I also think that was a nice, unusual way to take down the fic, and from what I can tell it was canon-appropriate. You had me really worried at the end of part 2 that &quot;no casualties&quot; wouldn&#39;t happen (that is, good job building up the tension).<br><br>The whole mission also had plenty of silly moments, which is appropriate for the setting.<br><br>One complaint is that not much of the mission was spent on actually sporking the fic, but I don&#39;t think there were many viable ways to do that with a straight-up piece of torture porn. <br><br>- Tomash</p>

We don&#39;t know who she convinced, and we don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the white box July gave her, and...well, it&#39;s a good hook for wanting to read on.<br><br>All in all: enjoyed it a lot, both writing style and content (and Ilraen&#39;s cameo!)

            <p>A GOOD MISSION THE BEST MISSION<br>Ahem.<br><br>I&#39;ve gotten peeks at this at various stages of its writing process.  It really is a beautiful thing, seeing it all put together and fancy now.  In no particular order:<br><br>The treatment of the original fic-as-legendary is unigue, but subtle; the pall of off-ness in the surroundings in part two gets across the idea that something is wrong with <i>everything</i> without being overly dramatic or giving air time to actual torture porn itself.<br><br>The choices of color and creature for the PPC Zords are so spot-on and wonderful, and I love that the mission essentially follows the format of a <i>Mighty Morphin&#39;</i> episode.  But I love that bringing giant robots into the mission wasn&#39;t enough on its own—that the agents needed a canon character, especially the one the fic was trying to attack, to put in the really decisive victory.  Kimberley&#39;s speech against the dark ranger is perfect and wonderful, and I feel like the character deserved to give such a speech, both in this fic and in general.  And I loved that Bulk and Skull got a cameo at the end, not only for the fun of it, but because the characters who were always the silliest part of the show make an excellent counter to the serious, angsty subject matter of &quot;Agony in Pink.&quot;  (And their theme song played in my head of its own volition.)<br><br>The cameos from veterans of legendary missions past are excellent.  It makes for a great love letter to July&#39;s history with the PPC, and the teamwork aspect stands as a thematic contrast to the singling-out selfish wish fulfillment in the original badfic.<br><br>The goodbyes at the end, especially the one between Agent!July and Library feel so sad for me, but at the same time, July kept a note of hope in there, too.  The parallel is clear: that the friendships between us are bigger than the PPC, and can continue even as people drift away from the community.  Same goes for seaman!July using her PPC knowledge in her future career; I don&#39;t think any of us ever truly stop being PPC, and the knowledge and wisdom we gain in this community stick with us as we move forward and grow.<br><br>This mission is beautiful.  This <i>is</i> the PPC, both in-universe, and the community.  Thank you, July, for giving us this brilliant piece!<br><br>Go, go, Plot Protectors!<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know how much weigth it can carry, but I sincerly regret July&#39;s departure from PPC. For the really messy way it went, for not trying to discuss more with her and many people leving here, both for the interactions and the writing advices, and, well for the excellent missions like this one was. I really hope she gets to keep on the writing beyond the PPC, making this one the last hurrah would just be a damn shame. But, like she said, moving backwards wouldn&#39;t do.<br><br>Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers.<br>Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers.<br>Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers.<br>Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers. Here are spoilers.<br><br>As far as telling new things about how awesome that mission was for me, there was something darkly meta with the Dark Ranger babbling about making Kimberly &#39;legendary&#39;. The fact she was the one to make the win possible is also something really cool, and I guess meta too, since that&#39;s canon literally fighting back and winning. <br><br>I also chuckled with the last jab from the Flowers for the salary, and liked the reference to past agents. And, I&#39;m now really curious about this Navigator. I just can&#39;t help it, mysteries like Huinesoron mentionned only leave me hungry for more.<br><br>Also a very last thing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wt6XlVob_E">We can&#39;t have a Power Rangers sporking without an appropriate theme running on for the final.</a> Come on, if you didn&#39;t think about it, you never heard it before. And it&#39;s just perfect to listen to during Act 3. Dragonforce too, that said.</p>

            <p>As July says, I beta&#39;d it, so I&#39;ve been watching Part 3 in particular for a long time, but it&#39;s been ages since I went back and read the whole thing end to end. And... I love it. Part One showcases everything that is best about the world of the PPC, and starts building up the anticipation for the denument. Part Two builds the tension up to spectacular levels - and Part Three delivers. Oh, how it delivers. This is the most creative finale to a PPC mission that I remember reading, and I&#39;ve been here since &#39;03, so that&#39;s saying a lot.<br><br>Read this mission. Read it unspoiled.

            <p>I&#39;ve been around the PPC since... Jeez. A while now. Not on the board, not in the community, but reading missions at the very least.<br><br>As I said back after reading Part 1, this took me back. Back to the just straight-up FUN of some of the earliest missions I read. About half-bored, half-insane agents rocking out to heavy metal to distract themselves from agonizing fics as they tried to keep what was left of their sanity. This isn&#39;t a grim mission, or a bleak mission. It brought back both nostalgia and a genuine sense of joy at just how silly it was. It felt like the mission was enjoying itself, and I couldn&#39;t help but join in the fun.<br><br>The fact that it features Trojie and Dafydd (two of my all-time favorite agents) as well as a collection of other PPC legends really doesn&#39;t hurt either.</p>

            <p>And the spoilery one, too.<br><br>July makes PPCing a godawful NSFW Legendary <i>fun</i>. I can think of no higher praise than that. It was a pleasure to help bring this along, and I&#39;m proud to have been a part of it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>This review contains spoilers. You <b>should not</b> read it, or even click on it, without reading the mission first. Seriously. It&#39;s an amazing mission, and you shouldn&#39;t spoil it for yourself by reading my ramblings before you get to it.<br><br>~<br><br>~<br><br>~<br><br>Part One is a wonderful exploration both of July&#39;s return to HQ and the Flowers&#39; dealings with <i>Agony in Pink</i> (and Legendaries as a whole), then turns into the glorious Cafeteria romp. The whole section is stuffed with foreshadowing for Part Three, which definitely rewards rereading once you know what&#39;s coming.<br><br>Part Two does a marvellous job of gradually establishing just how tough the fic is going to be to kill, but is also a quality mission. I&#39;ve always preferred reports that don&#39;t linger on the NSFW parts of badfics - my <i>C<em>l</em>br__n</i> mission is the same - and although it&#39;s short, it didn&#39;t need to be longer. It establishes what&#39;s bad about the fic, shows us enough that we feel it, introduces the players for Part Three - and then isn&#39;t afraid to move on.<br><br>As for Part Three... in the original outline (I said I&#39;d been watching this for a long time), July introduced this section with the line <i>And then... Go Go Canon Rangers!</i>. It grabbed me by the fannishness and has never let go. I love the escalation over the course of the fight; I have to particularly highlight <i>&quot;I think we&#39;re about to find out what happens when a badfic fights back,&quot;</i> which stands as a mission statement for the mission that is spectacularly fulfilled.<br><br>Reading over this, and Dafydd&#39;s interactions, takes me back to the process of writing it. I tweaked a lot of what he says and does, but the core of it is straight from July.  (Though I will claim <i>Ambalenar Atsordë!</i> all for my own - ambale-nar is Quenya for &#39;fiery yellowhammer&#39;, while atsordë is a phonetic Quenyification of &#39;Zord&#39;).<br><br>The Dark Ranger is a perfect payoff to the setup in Part Two, and July was absolutely right to let Kimberly fight it. Some demons, you have to fight by yourself.<br><br>The Aftermath is a perfect ending: bittersweet levied with humour. I still have no idea who the Navigator is, but I guess some mysteries don&#39;t need to be answered.<br><br>I love this mission. It is a perfect farewell, one of the best I have ever read, and the only one that inspired me to create fanart:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PBYTBGP.png"><br><br>Thank you, July, and safe voyaging.<br><br>hS</p>
