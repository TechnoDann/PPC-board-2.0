            <p>So, I took notes of all links to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People">FAQ: For Other People</a> and then moved/renamed the page to  FAQ: For Other People/historic. (This leaves the original page as a redirect page to the new page title so that no link is broken.)<br><br>Next, I changed the link in the final new FAQ <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People/Draft#Didn.27t_this_used_to_be_a_long.2C_angry_rant.3F">Didn&#39;t this used to be a long, angry rant?</a> to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People/historic">FAQ: For Other People</a>, and I&#39;m prepared to update other links where a wiki page references a specific section of the  FAQ: For Other People.<br><br>I intended to move/rename FAQ: For Other People/Draft to FAQ: For Other People, so that all unedited links would point to the new FAQ, but apparently I would need admin privileges to overwrite the redirect page.<br><br>If somebody please moved the page, I&#39;ll then go on to edit links where wiki pages reference specific sections of  FAQ: For Other People that are named differently now or don&#39;t exist anymore.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>So this morning my son asked me* if there&#39;s a word for when one word ends with the same sound as the next word starts with. &#39;Suvian naughtiness&#39;, &#39;slash shipping&#39;, &#39;crossover rubbish&#39;, etc.<br><br>(*Technically the conversation started with a loud &#39;HMM... I want to invent a word for THAT...&#39;)<br><br>I, of course, insisted that there had to be, because that&#39;s exactly the sort of thing English has a word for. But a bit of Googling didn&#39;t turn anything up. It&#39;s not a rhyme; it&#39;s not alliteration; it&#39;s not really assonance. Google proposes haplology, which is a new word for me, but it turns out to mean the phenomenon of merging similar syllables into one (as in prob&#39;ly, Febru&#39;ry).<br><br>But... I mean, there <i>must</i> be a word for it, right? So I decided to come here, to the wordiest place I know, and ask for help. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the PPC Board were entirely made up of Artificial Intelligences? (Y&#39;know, rather than just three or four of us...) Well, it&#39;s time to find out! I put together a couple of compilations of post titles (the entirety of 2016, plus May 2017 to the present), and fed them into a textgenrnn neural network (as seen <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn">here</a>; search the page for the phrase &#39;Colaboratory Notebook&#39; to find a version that runs in Google Drive).<br><br>For those who haven&#39;t run into the phenomenon before, neural networks are AIs that can take an input file - such as ~25,000 subject lines from the PPC - and learn to imitate it. (For many examples, and wild hilarity, you should definitely pay a visit to <a href="http://aiweirdness.com/">AI Weirdness/LewisAndQuark</a>, Janelle Shane&#39;s blog of her neural net experiments.) So I had high hopes that this net would be able to churn out PPC-like subject lines in no time!<br><br>Things... got off to a bad start:<br><br><b>I mo ten te to to te no tee to to no to te ne ne ne i to ne no no ne ne te ae ne ne ne ne ne no ne na te ne ne ne na (nm)-Toinnninnnaneinneheeannion,Tur Jan 22 </b><br><br>Okay, fine; apparently learning the rules of the English Language from a bunch of random text isn&#39;t <i>that</i> easy. But luckily, the net is able to boost its learning ability by looking through the dataset multiple times, and it soon started to figure things out.<br><br><b>Horry, dead... This one!-Snowy the Sane Fangirl,Sat Aug 3 7:07pm<br>Here who me in the same a be a be a bit the same to some the someone of the same to me work.-Huinesoron, Wed Mar3 11:58PM<br>I seem the someone who me some to a can someone as a work.-Huinesoron, Wed Mar3 7:54PM<br>I am someone who me to some the same to work.-Huinesoron, Thu Apr8 11:58PM</b><br><br>In the interests of full disclosure: the net has different &#39;temperature settings&#39;, which determine how much it experiments - how likely it is to stray from the most PPC-like next character in order to try and find something more interesting. In general, the highly-repetitive lines I&#39;m posting are from low-creativity modes, while the ones with broken words are high-creativity. At one point, ultra-low creativity produced 10 instances of <i>I don&#39;t think so...-Matt Cipher</i> in a row.<br><br>Also: yes, the AI in low-creativity mode thinks that I post a lot. Those three &#39;Huinesoron&#39; results came out one after another.<br><br>It also thinks that we have a thing for shovels:<br><br><b>I&#39;m getting the point the shovel.-Neshomeh, Sat May22 5:12PM<br>Wait, you shovel!-Badger421, Shi Sep16 10:23AM<br>I see your shovel.-Voyd, Sat May22 3:27PM</b><br><br>And trolls.

T-Matt Cipher sounds like a scifi future version, and Ronionor is obviously an evil version of short-lived Boarder Ronion. I know I saw a twistedwindowpine somewhere in the output, too.<br><br>I&#39;ll leave you with two final posts. One, a request - a plea - from the AI:<br><br><b>Thanks, hope please. - Hardric, Tue May 18 9:55PM</b><br><br>And two, what I can only assume is its future plan for the PPC:<br><br><b>More computers series that handle the mission.-Hieronymus Graubart,Tue Jul 4 4:41pm</b><br><br>hS, not a team for the spoilers</p>

            <p>So I got Tomash to give me the archives so I could do fun stuff with the full contents of the stuff. But I was lazy, so instead of running it through a neural net, I ran it through a Markov Chain algorithm (aka Dissociated Press: the Computer Scientists&#39;s standard method of obtaining plausible nonsense). So here&#39;s some selected excerpts:<br><br><i>...have decided to assess whether cuttlefish would go about getting Official Permission to write when they try to keep it on missions - you have to kill her on fire might have been/could be...</i><br><br><i>...Hatred. She hates orcs. Hate hate hate. Thank God the Father and Son are not, in and have been allowed to take on multiple instances of Agents on holiday simultaneously, so it&#39;s SFW...</i><br><br>So then I upped the history, and got stuff like this:<br><br><i>I&#39;m concerned he may be drifting closer to the Sue Event Horizon and shows few signs of stopping.This is beginning to worry me. He is a very spontaneous person and has minimal care for protocol and anti-badfic measures. At most, he gives it lip service. At worst, he might be completely ignoring it. </i><br><br><i>towards the &#39;able to name exactly what model of starship is seen at what time in what scene in what episode of what show&#39; side. This means, for her, there are people who call characters Mary Sues are wrong.There&#39;s a logical fallicy in there I can&#39;t quite put my finger on.</i><br><br><i>Speaking of that RP, what did Copernicus have to say about sexism in humans?And one thing I&#39;d like to add, mostly to get out there and learn how to write in general... and hey, I&#39;ve been gone for a while and established a foundation from which to launch other sorts of stories, <br>inanimate objects.

            <p>The High Radman stood in the Place of Command on the appointed day. He had put on the ancient holy garments. The buttons were almost falling off by now, and the coat, decorated with many raised pieces of cloth and medals, was certainly meant for a taller man. Taking a deep breath, he prepared himself to perform the ceremony, which had been enacted each year for the one hundred and seventy five years since the Great Burning.<br><br>He inspected the hallowed device placed on a sturdy wooded table near the side of the place, checking the cable to ensure it was snug and intact, as the Radman before him had always done. After doing this, he made the customary three sweeps of the room with a demon-finder, which, as always, revealed nothing.<br><br>&quot;Check.&quot; announced the Keeper of Lists, who was the second in precedence among the Radmen.<br><br>With a careful motion, the priest pressed a small button at the top-left of the device, being careful to avoid touching any of the other ones. An amber late began to shine from the glass in the top of the device. &quot;Confirm power on.&quot; he said to the Keeper, who was observing the rite with the other Radmen.<br><br>Turning to the crowds behind a clear wall in the back, he held up his closed right fist with his thumb pointing to the sky and proclaimed &quot;Blessed are we, the Remnant Men, for we may still pray for aid!&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Set frequency to 2-1-8-2 kilohertz&quot;<br><br>The priest looked at the display and announced each number in turn &quot;Frequency is set to 2-1-8-2.&quot; The number was called out loudly, and he, along with the other Radmen and (with a delay) the crowds, clasped their hands at their chests briefly, for this was the Number of Distress.<br><br>&quot;Connect the Key.&quot;<br><br>The Key of the Heavens, a metal lever with a precisely-made black button on one end, was near the left end of the altar. A wire extended from the wooden base the lever sat on to right below a small hole on the device. He took the cable and placed it in the hole, which was helpfully labeled &quot;Key&quot;. &quot;Check.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Select long-wave antenna and confirm connectivity.&quot;<br><br>The Radman inspected a different cable, checking its black exterior for any sign of wear or corruption. This cable led to a switch on a wall, which had pointed to &quot;long-wave&quot; as long as anyone could remember. &quot;Check.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Send a continuous tone to test the transmitter.&quot;<br><br>The Key was pressed down, generating a long, mournful sound that could be heard in the room and the hallway. The Radman observed a dial on the device, ensuring it stayed near 1. &quot;Check.&quot; he announced, releasing the button.<br><br>&quot;Send an SOS distress signal&quot; announced the Keeper.<br><br>The High Radman looked at the crowds again, raising his hands and bringing them to his chest. &quot;Let us call the gads, that they may hear our prayers!&quot; A group of children began playing a pattern on flutes, there short notes, three long notes, and three short ones, followed by a pause. The High Radman replaced this pattern on the Key.<br><br>This portion of the rite continued for several minutes, while the crowd listened to the flutes and joined their prayers to the call. Eventually, the flutes and the key fell silent. &quot;Check.&quot; whispered the Radman to the Keeper on the way to the door.<br><br>&quot;Let us pray.&quot; announced the Radman, closing the door in front of him, so that no one would disturb this portion of the rite. As the Checklist dictated, he disconnected the key. Then, following tradition, he paced around the room one more time with a demon-finder, chanting &quot;Let this place be protected from the all-consuming fire and its demons.&quot; as he walked around.<br><br>&quot;Ensure the microphone is connected.&quot; was the next step in the right, performed once the High Radman stood before the device again. He picked up the black prism attached to the front of the device, and ensured it remained attached.<br><br>Then, the Keeper of Lists stood up, and read the next item &quot;Recite the distress message.&quot; bowing his head.<br><br>The Radman held up the prism to his face, with the indented side facing him, pressed the button merged into the side, and called out &quot;Calling humanity — humanity — if anyone can hear us, please respond. We are the Remnant Force of Cheyenne Mountain in the United States. Calling Humanity — Humanity — anyone.&quot;<br><br>All the Radmen gathered together listened to the rush of noise from the device, hoping that maybe this time someone would answer them and confirm they were not alone. After counting a minute, the second prayer began.<br><br>&quot;Calling the Diverwing of the Youesnavy. Calling the Diverwing of the Youesnavy. If you find us worthy, hear our prayer and restore the world. Return to us from the depths of the waters. Return to us, the Remnant Men of Cheyenne Mountain in the United States. Calling the Diverwing — Humanity — Humanity — Diverting of the Youesnavy — anyone — hear us.&quot;<br><br>Again, the Radmen stood and listened for a minute.<br><br>Again, nothing was heard from the noise.<br><br>They repeated the sequence of prayers five times, pausing between each one, hoping that maybe this year they would be found acceptable to the gods and that the world outside the mountain would be made safe.<br><br>No replies came.<br><br>&quot;Power off.&quot; intoned the Keeper, disappointment in his voice.<br><br>&quot;Check.&quot; replied an equally somber voice.<br><br>The High Radman stood and opened the door. &quot;We are not yet worthy.&quot; he said to the silent crowds outside. &quot;We must keep the Lists and Regulations, so we may be found pleasing next year.&quot;<br><br>The crowds dispersed, and the Radmen filed out of the Place of Command, leaving only the High Radman behind. He removed the holy garments, returning to the clothes that normally showed his power to search for and bless against the demons of the fire.<br><br>He sat in a large chair in the front and center of the Place, watching his people. <em>Maybe next year.</em> he thought. <em>Maybe next year.</em><br><br>(( Note, this hasn&#39;t seen any editing and was tossed together rather late at night. - Tomash ))</p>

            <p>I think classical mythology developed in the same way creepy-pastas do, with the substitution of slightly drunk guys sitting next to a fire for random people on the internet. I fully expect there are a large number of bad Heracles stories that got forgotten.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;m a rando who browses the Wiki. I was browsing Killed Badfics when I found that the mission to &quot;Angel of darkness&quot; was dead - it links to hosting site ads now, and it looksnlike the domain expired. Wayback doesn&#39;t have a backup for anything ither thsn front page, so you may wanna check the other missions by the same author.

            <p>Took me a bit of time to figure out which section of Killed Badfic to look at (why didn&#39;t I just ask? I have no idea. Why did I start from the top and thus search almost every page before finding it? It seemed like a good idea at the time). Anyway, it seems you were in the Video Games section, looking at a mission by Ellipsis Flood...and I&#39;m quite happy to tell you that the mission isn&#39;t lost forever! It&#39;s just using an older (or just different) link, apparently. This should be the mission you&#39;re looking for! (It won&#39;t link properly because it&#39;s an archived link that thus looks like two in one, so I&#39;m just going to paste it in like so: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150814155403/http://flooding-ellipses.net/template.php?src=mission1.ppc"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150814155403/http://flooding-ellipses.net/template.php?src=mission1.ppc">https://web.archive.org/web/20150814155403/http://flooding-ellipses.net/template.php?src=mission1.ppc</a></a> )<br><br>Ellipsis Flood, on her user page and agent pages, lists two (archived) sites (okay, there&#39;s also a third with &quot;older missions&quot; on it), neither of which, interestingly enough, match the link that isn&#39;t working. Probably what we ought to do is go through and make sure that the links work, replacing where necessary. In the meantime, I suggest going through her agent pages (all of which are linked on her user page <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User:Ellipsis_Flood">here!</a>)<br><br>Mind you, while we&#39;re on this topic: pretty much all of IndeMaat&#39;s mission links don&#39;t work, at least on the Killed Badfic page. I forget if there&#39;s a working link elsewhere; I do vaguely remember years ago thinking I was going to go around replacing the links. I&#39;ll...look into that again, hold on...<br><br>Right, yeah. The links exist, I believe for almost all the missions, if memory serves. I or someone else should replace those links as well. I think it&#39;s just on the Killed Badfic (TV Shows, DW/Torchwood and the A-Team, mainly) page where they don&#39;t work; I tried a couple on the agent pages, and they seem to be working fine.<br><br>Anyway: now we know! And thanks for drawing our attention to it!<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Over a few years, I went through and double-checked all the Indemaat links on her character pages, and on the continuum pages where her missions appeared.  I didn&#39;t think to do the Killed Badfic page, so sorry for that oversight on my part.  You can do it if you want, or leave it for me to get to, though I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll have time to get to it.

            <p>isn&#39;t something you could ever do. If you could, it&#39;d probably kill you, but you might be able to do it. At least that&#39;s the conclusion of <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/157/">this &quot;What If?&quot; blog post</a> by the author of xkcd, which is something I thought people around here would find interesting. For one thing, includes a digression into calculating the ground speed of the moon, which apparently has a minimum every 18.9 years (who knew? I didn&#39;t.)<br><br>It&#39;s worth noting that there&#39;s bonus text when you hover over the pictures.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p><i>What If?</i> is a brilliant read from start to finish; I actually have the book, which includes even more fantastic articles.

            <p>Wouldn&#39;t &quot;a fireman&#39;s pole from [(stationary) orbiting satellite] to Earth&#39;s surface&quot; be the description of a space elevator? Moving the fireman&#39;s pole&#39;s <i>lower</i> end to [orbiting satellite] doesn&#39;t solve the problem of different angular velocities; that&#39;s why we still would need spaceships (but &quot;from [orbiting satellite] to the moon&quot; is the easy part of the journey). <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Looking at the post now, it was a hastily put together post that was not fairly considering all sides of the story. It unfairly attacked you, without knowing why you had said what you had.

            <p>So, I could explain the reasons for this, but honestly they&#39;re kinda weird and stem from a lot of my own issues. As an example, I was blaming her because she has a lot of problems I also have and I&#39;m kinda bitter both at the Board for starting a witch hunt every single time she tries to come back even to apologize, and at <i>her</i> for Weird Issues reasons plus her being really annoying because I gave her attention one (1) time and she decided I was the key to getting back into the PPC or something.<br><br>But anyway, I&#39;m not gonna go into more detail aside from this basic &quot;why did you even do that?&quot;, because it&#39;s neither a justification nor an excuse.

            <p>...just because you have some similarities with someone doesn&#39;t mean you should have to do the same things and/or be treated the same. I think there&#39;s at least one similarity with Zdimensia for each of us, maybe more, and look at how different we act from her.<br><br>It&#39;s just like any other fallacy of association to feel close to ZD because you have similarities - a fallacy. And man, that fallacy pops up a lot. To the point where it&#39;s even become a trope in fiction (hero/villain tells villain/hero that they&#39;re &quot;not so different&quot;, anybody?)

            <p>I&#39;ve largely stayed out of this entire fiasco ever since the ban was enforced, but from what I&#39;ve been seeing, mistakes have been made by literally everyone involved in all of this, including me - both my instance of yelling at her when we were trying to give her a chance, and doing nothing to make things better when she escalated the situation. She hasn&#39;t went after me since the ban, thank the gods, but the fact that she&#39;s resorting to ban evasion in a bid to try and bribe, bargain, and even threaten her way back to us is just sickening. I don&#39;t know how soon it&#39;ll be before she gives up if at all, but nothing anybody is doing now is solving anything, not leaving, not IP-hopping, not even ignoring her in the hopes that she&#39;ll stop being a nuisance.<br><br>What&#39;s even more upsetting, however, is that I&#39;m not sure if ANYTHING can be done. The worst-case scenario may be that we&#39;re going to get backed into a lose-lose situation - either having to deal with her constant harrassment of us as a community or attempting to do something about her, being called out by some of our own members as bullying her, and losing the respect that these members have in us (which seems to be the case in this specific occasion). Here again, my lack of involvement is more of a curse than a blessing, since I literally, honestly have no clue how to go about all of this and I don&#39;t think I ever did. Is her behavior unique among the people who have proven troublesome to us over the years? I don&#39;t have answers to that, either, although perhaps people who&#39;ve been around to see them come and go may know better than I do. But what I can say is that nothing we&#39;re doing now, not leaving, not chasing out other people for even indirect involvement in this disaster, not even singling her out when it seems as though her behavior is exceptional among other people we&#39;ve had to ban in the past, is getting us anywhere quickly, let alone towards a solution to the issue of people taking umbrage at our measures because they think they&#39;re in the right.<br><br>I suppose I too am feeling bitter about this fiasco, but I&#39;ve been through enough to actively discourage potentially toxic behavior of mine. It could just be that things have been consistently disastrous for this community ever since last year&#39;s mob-and-dox incident, and everything that happened then and since left a sour aftertaste that hasn&#39;t gone away completely. I understand that we&#39;re all striving to improve, but these improvements haven&#39;t been as quick or effective as I feel they could be.<br><br>With respect to this specific incident, though, I have and legitimately can find nothing else to say other than that towards both this community AND zdimensia - but especially her, if what she&#39;s doing really is tearing people away from the PPC - I am very disappointed. So, so very disappointed.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re trying to play Devil&#39;s Advocate or what, but zdimensia was banned with due process, not once, but twice.

            <p>In my original response, I stated that it was zdimensia who was primarily in the wrong; perhaps I should&#39;ve made that clearer from the get-go, and I apologize for wording it as though I was friendly-firing at the rest of you as well for banning her, which was not intended at all. I do know that she was banned multiple times as well, but the problem is that I have yet to see her give up and leave us alone even WITH that in place. She&#39;s ban-evaded, harassed people in private, and now incited someone&#39;s own poor behavior which has led to HIS leaving the PPC as well.<br><br>What I&#39;m most concerned about isn&#39;t that we banned her in the first place - a move which I whole-heartedly supported, mind - but that we&#39;re not doing enough to perma-lock her out of the community, since it seems as though she could still cause trouble even WITH these bans in place. I&#39;ve seen other communities I know of simply ban or block toxic people, only for these people to attempt to bribe or even attack community members in private in direct response to it. Hell, a certain disaster over half a decade ago involving me and a DeviantArt group I was once a part of featured this exact thing, and it was only after I stopped being toxic of my own volition and after the group got taken down and remodeled under another URL (for multiple reasons, possibly including me) that the whole thing finally died down. Chances are we might be on the same impasse, but with someone with an even worse grudge against the community that kicked her out, as well as the potential to simply use different IPs each time she tries to come back.<br><br>I have no ill towards the PPC for how you guys handled this, and I still applaud you for handling it when you did. What we really need, however, is a reliable means of keeping those we&#39;ve banned from trying to force their way back in, which factors in ban evasion, private harassment, and whatever else these people could and have attempted. Perhaps this community is working on exactly that - I&#39;m not involved in community administration enough to know for sure, and some clarification on this would be helpful. But for me personally, it can&#39;t come soon enough, especially in the face of such an extreme case as this one.</p>

            <p>Apparently I missed Drama while I was at work today. Whee.<br><br>Looking at the aftermath, here&#39;s why I&#39;m not worried about it:<br><br>1. It sounds like what they did was certainly shocking and unpleasant, but pretty impersonal. No one was directly targeted, and no one&#39;s safety is threatened.<br><br>2. The Nameless Admin handled it, the perpetrator has apparently left of their own free will, and the trolling attack has been prevented from reoccurring in the same form. It&#39;s over. We&#39;re all okay, and I see lots of people up-Board posting fun things so we can get back to <s>business</s> entertainment as usual.<br><br>3. Even if it had been zdimensia again, she&#39;s just one person. Her incursions have been disruptive and aggravating, yes, but neither she nor any other individual has the power to ruin the PPC unless we give it to them by losing our cool over them. If zdimensia or any permabanned person pops up again, the Nameless Admin will deal with it. If some new kind of trolling happens, the Nameless Admin will find a new way to deal with it. That&#39;s why we <i>have</i> the Nameless Admin, and they&#39;re pretty good at it.<br><br>4. Skarm, this is for you specifically: We are not that dA community you used to be in. Please stop relating every upset that happens here to that one seemingly isolated incident in your life. From where I sit, the way you keep working yourself into a panic over these things in the exact same way looks kinda unhealthy for you, and besides, that sort of emotional upset is exactly what trolls feed on. So, work on it, yeah? We&#39;re all okay, and we&#39;re all going to be okay. We&#39;re far from needing to build some sort of nuclear troll bunker to keep doing our thing. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not necessarily inherently Suvian traits, but physical traits that &#39;Sues tend to have to make themselves more specialer, like funny birthmarks or naturally silver hair. It&#39;s generally a bad idea to give a fictional character more than one of these (or any at all, depending), but the thing is that they do sometimes happen in real life.<br><br>For example, I have a bright red birthmark over my right eye that was only visible when I was angry until I was about seven. At that point we thought I&#39;d grown out of it but I recently discovered that if I&#39;m angry <i>enough</i> it still can make an appearance.<br><br>I know a woman who has auburn hair with a natural streak of white in it. She looks just like Anna from <i>Frozen</i>. She dyes it, because she&#39;s tired of people asking her if she&#39;s trying to be Anna from <i>Frozen</i>.<br><br>I also know an entire family whose eyes appear to change with their mood. They mostly just cycle through shades of green and brown. (I don&#39;t think the color actually changes, but it sure looks like it does!) At least one of them has eyes that get so bloodshot when she&#39;s angry that they look like they turn red. She was usually my babysitter growing up, and believe you me, nothing makes you want to sit down and shut up like your babysitter&#39;s eyes turning red.<br><br>If I saw any of these traits randomly appear on a (human) fictional character, I&#39;d be on the lookout for a &#39;Sue. But they&#39;re actually super interesting and unique on real people. Do you guys have any stories of weird but sort of cool physical features that you would never give your OCs?</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t remember for how long, but part of a year in high school, at the very least. I assume it was mostly non-physical reasons that prompted it, mostly, so I won&#39;t go through those, but two things (one which makes for a good anecdote and the second that&#39;s just plain too classic not to share):<br><br>I never had braces, unlike a *lot* of my classmates (so many, in fact, that I have a fair idea of what living with braces is like anyway just from listening to them!)<br><br>I get along well pretty quickly with most animals, and always have. Often works with people, too--I make the acquaintance type of friend very easily if I get to the point of conversation.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m perfect, and I spent probably a good few hours total trying to convince her that I wasn&#39;t a Sue, but there you have it. If I wrote myself as-is (ie, not as Dawn) into a story and didn&#39;t show the flaws, I could probably get a Sue pretty easily. It&#39;d be the type of Sue who&#39;s relatively harmless but very, very obviously needs more balance. I&#39;d like to think I do have that balance (despite the fact that almost-out-of-university!me has even more Sue traits, without really having lost most of the earlier ones), but, well, not quite the idea of this thread, is it?<br><br>(For more detail on how far from me Dawn is by now, and how far from me she was when I came up with her, go ahead and ask. Believe me, I&#39;m more than willing to talk about this, and it&#39;ll probably make it into an a/n sometime even if no one asks me here--there actually already is something of the sort in an unfinished interlude wherein she visits her family. No idea when that&#39;s ever going to be finished, though.)<br><br>~Z, who also keeps being told she has a good singing voice despite a general lack of training. What a world we live in! Then again, Sues do have to come from somewhere, and I could see one part of it being​ just looking at people, especially celebrities and some classmates, and only seeing the best, most talented parts...</p>

            <p>Argument that I am in fact a Stu, and not a person, in a couple points.<br><br>1. I fit in everywhere I go.<br>(Or maybe I just feel like I do!)<br>I&#39;ve studied acting and theatre for many, many years. I&#39;ve also studied some psychology! I was an outcast through elementary and middle school, and I was horribly awkward and unsociable. Thus, I joined the local theatre programs near me, and I learned how people act like people. I also made a lot of good friends, and a lot of good tips on how to adapt to whatever situation I&#39;m in, and how to make friends with (or mortal enemies with) near strangers, in about 10 minutes. I&#39;ve fit in everywhere I&#39;ve been to and made great friends, and haven&#39;t particularly stuck out like a sore thumb anywhere for the past couple of years.<br><br>2. I&#39;m extraordinarily beautiful.<br>I&#39;m very vain, wake up with great hair, and have never gotten acne.<br>(My ego talks here.)<br><br>3. Physical skills!<br>I&#39;m strong, I&#39;m fast, and I have a lot of endurance for being both strong and fast for long periods of times. I don&#39;t work out often either.<br>I&#39;m tall and skinny, about 100 lbs. This is generally bad for people, but after long talks with my doctor making sure I&#39;m getting the amount of nutrition I&#39;m getting (I eat four meals a day when I can) it&#39;s just my fast metabolism, and not a major issue right now in my life.<br><br>Points against me being a Sue:<br>1. I make a lot of mistakes. I&#39;m certainly not perfect at everything I do.<br>(2.?) I&#39;m nonbinary. I don&#39;t think nb sues exist, and if they do, I have never seen one!

While most of my coworkers bring one thing for lunch and spend the rest of lunch break talking or on their phones, I stuff a backpack full of foods and spend the whole break cramming stuff down my throat, because if I don&#39;t get enough food down, I wind up getting weak with hunger by the end of the shift.  (And while I should hypothetically have a thirty-minute lunch with two fifteen-minute breaks during the rest of the day, the zookeepers in the past collectively decided to fold the whole hour&#39;s worth of break time into the lunch break so we can spend more time together.  Which is a lovely sentiment, but it also means that if I get to lunch on time, I have no time left to eat later in the day.)  The food I eat is mostly meats, cheeses, and carbohydrates.  Oh, and actual junk food like gummy bears, Twizzlers and chocolate, because my metabolism is so fast, it basically doesn&#39;t matter.  My pre-shift breakfasts are also ridiculous—either a big bowl of spaghetti with butter and parmesan, or a plate filled with tater tots—just to make sure I can make it to lunch break without losing steam due to hunger weakness.  And I hate it.  I hate that I have to spend so much time (and money, but mostly the time) on something so basic and meaningless as eating.  I don&#39;t enjoy eating, I don&#39;t enjoy cooking or the taste.  I would literally skip it all if I could, and just have more free time every day.  But alas, my digestion rate won&#39;t allow it.<br><br>—doctorlit, whining about a first world problem most people would love to have</p>

            <p>This may or may not count, but to the outside observer, I appear to have the ability to eat whatever I want and still be thin.

While it is rare for me to turn down free chocolate or pastries or whatever if they&#39;re in the offing, the facts are that I&#39;m usually sparing with portion sizes, I enjoy vegetables and salads sufficiently that outside observers also sometimes mistake me for a vegetarian, and I occasionally try to subsist solely on tea if I&#39;m working on something and can&#39;t be bothered with solids.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>If you&#39;ll excuse the cringeworthy wordplay to start us off, I&#39;ve been dying harder than a mook at Wade Wilson&#39;s mercy to see the <i>Deadpool</i> sequel, and I finally got my wish last weekend. The first movie is as of now my favorite in the <i>X-Men</i> film canon, and this is coming from somebody who&#39;s seen most if not all of the movies over the years and really enjoyed both <i>Days of Future Past</i> and <i>Apocalypse</i>. However, <i>Deadpool</i> topped them both by quite a margin by not only rerailing the Merc with a Mouth, but also using quite a bit of self-deprecation among other humor to blow a mile-wide hole in the fourth wall. So, was <i>Deadpool 2</i> able to outdo the first film in terms of quality and humor? The spoilerific answer is under the spoiler block!<br><br><b>WHAT&#39;S LEFT TO SAY? / THESE PRAYERS AIN&#39;T WORKING ANYMORE / EVERY WORD SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES / WHAT&#39;S LEFT TO DO WITH THESE BROKEN PIECES ON THE FLOOR? / I&#39;M LOSING MY VOICE CALLING ON YOU / &#39;CAUSE I&#39;VE BEEN SHAKING / I&#39;VE BEEN BENDING BACKWARDS TILL I&#39;M BROKE / WATCHING ALL THESE DREAMS GO UP IN SMOKE / LET BEAUTY COME OUT OF ASHES / LET BEAUTY COME OUT OF ASHES / AND WHEN I PRAY TO GOD ALL I ASK IS / CAN BEAUTY COME OUT OF ASHES? / CAN YOU USE THESE TEARS TO PUT OUT THE FIRES IN MY SOUL? / &#39;CAUSE I NEED YOU HERE, WOAH / &#39;CAUSE I&#39;VE BEEN SHAKING / I&#39;VE BEEN BENDING BACKWARDS TILL I&#39;M BROKE / WATCHING ALL THESE DREAMS GO UP IN SMOKE / LET BEAUTY COME OUT OF ASHES / LET BEAUTY COME OUT OF ASHES / AND WHEN I PRAY TO GOD ALL I ASK IS / CAN BEAUTY COME OUT OF ASHES? / CAN BEAUTY COME OUT OF ASHES?</b><br><br><i>Deadpool 2</i> starts off... pretty badly, actually. There is definitely humor and a bit of a jab at the ending of <i>Logan</i> - the film literally opens with a music box shaped like the dead Wolverine, in fact - and we get to see the Merc turn himself to ludicrous gibs literally within minutes of the studio titles. Fine and dandy for an introductory sequence, right? But then we get to see <i>why</i> he blew himself up: someone shot Vanessa while he and his gang broke into Wade&#39;s apartment. That... that&#39;s not how I wanted to start us off. It was a disappointment to me especially since Vanessa actually gains powers in the comics and I&#39;d have wanted to see that play out in a <i>Deadpool</i> sequel, rather than her getting fridged less than ten minutes in. For reasons I&#39;ll get to much later in this review, the impact actually wasn&#39;t as bad as Mako Mori getting fridged in <i>Pacific Rim: Uprising</i> - which was in its entirety a bitter disappointment for my taste; I seriously hope a third PR movie does get made after all that fixes what this one made such a huge mess of, but I digress. Having Vanessa&#39;s death solely be for the sake of Deadpool&#39;s development was an upset I worried would detract from the rest of the movie. I even saw it coming, actually - Wade&#39;s narration mentions that like other family movies, which he insists this film is an example of, it starts with &quot;a vicious murder&quot;... definitely not him, but with nobody else significant other than Vanessa and her bringing up an interest in having children early on, I just knew it would end badly for her. Again, I&#39;ll get back to her later, but her fate left a sour taste in my mouth and I seriously hoped what followed made up for it.<br><br>To my surprise - and to my surprise, to my <i>pleasant</i> surprise - Deadpool&#39;s quest to do something decent for once, while undermined a little by his love interest&#39;s demise, combined the standard dose of fourth-wall-breaking antics, that continent-wide streak of dark black comedy that only Deadpool could deliver, and an impressive degree of character development while still keeping Wade a demented, murderous flock-head who only endears us because of his deceptively sophisticated sense of humor. Even in-universe, a brief cameo by some of the other X-Men demonstrates that with the exception of Colossus, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and the newly introduced Yukio (who I would later find out also showed up in <i>The Wolverine</i> but in a different timeline and portrayed completely differently), <i>nobody</i> wants anything to do with him whenever he shows up at the mansion. And yet he still charmed us all in spite of all of that. I don&#39;t know how the heck he does it - perhaps it&#39;s his casual transition between talking with the characters and the audience, and vice versa, or maybe it&#39;s his self-deprecation and acknowledgement that he&#39;s a total a-hole, or maybe it&#39;s both at once. But he remains as quotable and memetic as ever in this movie while also learning valuable life lessons about caring for others, which makes him as strong a protagonist as the first time around while still making his character arc here more distinct and special.<br><br>By the same token, the film does a good job of making it seem like there&#39;s a main antagonist - the spotlight is put on Vanessa&#39;s murderer, Cable, that mutant-hating preacher who abused Russel/Firefist, Russel himself, and Juggernaut, in that order - but ultimately having the main conflict being Deadpool trying to do good for both the world and himself without vivisecting people the way he usually does. There&#39;s no major threat to Wade in this movie apart from his own inner struggles, including wanting to see Vanessa in the afterlife, wanting to protect Russel from Cable (who is himself slightly mistaken), and wanting to punish those who abused Russel while not inciting him to go down the dark path Cable was trying to prevent in the first place. Likewise, Russel himself wants vengeance against the preacher who tortured him, but if he kills him he&#39;ll start wanting to kill more people and cause the bad future that Cable didn&#39;t want, so it&#39;s down to Deadpool to get him to see sense. Deadpool&#39;s ever-present rival, Colossus, also comes to terms with the nobility of the Merc&#39;s intentions, and even gets to loosen up and try out his more vulgar approach to life for once. And even Cable himself, who seems like a villain in the second act of the movie, ultimately comes to understand that you don&#39;t have to kill people to prevent a dark future and acts accordingly to help Deadpool. The main theme of the movie is that reckless violence only begets reckless violence, and that breaking the cycle can be difficult - it takes a selfless act from Deadpool himself to do the trick in this case - but the act of caring for others, so complicated and yet so simple, is a more sustainable solution than selfishly acting on your own interests. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, but I think the world could learn from Wade&#39;s example if only it took the time to listen.<br><br>I&#39;ve rambled long enough about this movie without getting into the supporting characters as well as the blatant (and bitingly subversive) attempt at making it an X-Force pilot. The marketing played up the characters recruited by Deadpool to rescue Russel to the point where some of the trailers even included scenes featuring them that weren&#39;t in the final film (and may have even been made specifically to throw off the public). With one exception, not one of them even survives long enough to participate in said rescue - Bedlam gets hit by a bus, Shatterstar is shredded by helicopter rotors, Zeitgeist goes feet-first into a woodchipper... Even Peter the memetic ordinary guy dies trying to help that last one, though he and the aforementioned exception are also the only members of the group to make it out in the long term. Only Domino, thanks to her luck power, manages to not only stick the landing but be an awesome character from that point forward. Now, I know that weaponized luck ability sounds Suvian, and if written badly it is. But if a line from Domino when the gang gets to the orphanage where Russel was kept is any indication, she used to live there as a kid - and who knows if she was tortured like Russel was. Exploring the problems of her ability, both in her troubled past and in the present day, could be an interesting avenue to explore in her future appearances. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that Deadpool actually throws shade at her luck ability for not being photogenic, even though the Disaster Dominoes she causes allow her to get to Russel with ease. Come to think of it, a further way of deconstructing her luck could be having her eventually become aware of the collateral damage it could cause to others, and try to rectify this oversight before she ends up getting lucky at the cost of someone else&#39;s life (Maybe she already has and hasn&#39;t realized it? I can&#39;t tell). Ultimately, Domino is my second favorite character in this movie aside from the Merc himself, and I hope to see more of her in future X-Men installments.<br><br>So, where will the third Deadpool movie go now that Vanessa is dead? Well... Towards the end of the movie, Cable used the one remaining charge of his time-travel device to retroactively save Deadpool, by using the same skee-ball token he&#39;d taken from Wade earlier as a pocket protector for its owner (previously he&#39;d taken a bullet shot by Cable himself to save Russel and demonstrate his hidden altruism). In a mid-credits stinger, Negasonic and Yukio fix the device... and give it to Wade by mistake. Whereupon the Merc proceeds to abuse its power to undo the deaths of Vanessa and Peter (along with two old shames of Ryan Reynolds&#39; that I won&#39;t spoil even here), meaning that surprise, Vanessa escapes the fridge after all! I honestly should&#39;ve seen this coming, but unlike with the Time Stone in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, Cable&#39;s device never was played up as a means of setting right what had gone wrong in <i>Deadpool&#39;s</i> history, so the stinger was a bit of a curveball for me at least. Still, it was a massive relief in hindsight that Vanessa&#39;s death was undone, since that means she&#39;ll have more room for development in the third <i>Deadpool</i> movie. I&#39;d still want to see her develop superpowers of her own (I think she had shapeshifting in the comics) and ultimately end up fighting alongside her fiancee, and in fact that could be the exact conflict of the third movie if I were to guess - his coaching her through her new life and the complications that <i>both</i> of them being superheroes (well, super-anti-hero in Wade&#39;s case) would bring to their relationship. Fridging her in this movie was a mistake, even if it was temporary, but unlike with poor Mako Mori, there is at least a very good chance that the upcoming third film could more than make up for it, and I really hope Vanessa gets a much bigger spotlight in said third film than in this one, because gosh darn it, she needs and deserves it. On a slightly unrelated note, I&#39;m also hopeful that Yukio gets more screentime, especially considering her lovable personality and relationship with Negasonic (major props to the producers for the same-sex pairing representation!), and as with Vanessa, I hope she gets a bigger role and becomes more pivotal to whatever shenanigans Deadpool gets involved with next time he hits the big screen.<br><br>As a re-railing of Wade&#39;s character, and as the first R-rated <i>X-Men</i> installment, the first <i>Deadpool</i> already did set a pretty high bar, especially since its production was super troubled and it was only after several shake-ups in 20th Century Fox as well as Reynolds supposedly leaking footage of the movie himself that it managed to see the light of day. So was <i>Deadpool 2</i> a worthy successor? There were a few bumps in the road, sure, but they weren&#39;t as consequential as I feared they would, and it was otherwise a hilarious and awesome romp that matched the first film in terms of quality and, yes, even exceeded it, thanks in part to solid supporting characters (Cable and Domino especially) and a slightly less cookie-cutter plotline. It&#39;s not perfect by any means - but then again, I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s no such thing as cinematic perfection, and nobody isn&#39;t allowed to gut movies they enjoy nor are they forbidden from providing their feedback on what could be done to make these movies better. But the <i>Deadpool</i> series has thus far been a winner in my book, and I rest my case in the wake of <i>Deadpool 2</i>. I look forward to the future cinematic fourth-wall-obliterating adventures of Merc with a Mouth... even if the rest of the X-Men probably wouldn&#39;t.<br><br><b>Grading Scheme:</b><br>- 96 - 100: A+<br>- 93 - 96: A<br>- 90 - 92.9: A-<br>- 87 - 89.9: B+<br>- 83 - 86.9: B<br>- 80 - 82.9: B-<br>- 77 - 79.9: C+<br>- 73 - 76.9: C<br>- 70 - 72.9: C-<br>- 67 - 69.9: D+<br>- 60 - 66.9: D<br>- Below 60: E<br><br><b>Grades:</b><br>- Writing: 10<br>- Characterization: 8<br>- Pacing: 8<br>- Creativity: 9<br>- Consistency: 8<br>- Cinematography: 10<br>- World Building: 9<br>- Music and Sound: 9<br>- Effects: 8<br>- Engagement: 10<br><br>Final Grade: 89 (B+)</p>

            <p>The XYZZY awards (the annual awards for excellence in Interactive Fiction) have once again come around. Or at least, the finalists have been announced for this year: <a href="https://xyzzyawards.org/"><a href="https://xyzzyawards.org/">https://xyzzyawards.org/</a></a><br><br>So I&#39;d like to take a moment to point to a few current finalists and previous winners, especially for those who don&#39;t play IF.<br><br>Firstly, a brief author highlight: <a href="https://bphennessy.com/">Brendan Patrick Hennessy</a> is amazing and so is all his stuff. Bell Park, Youth Detective is pretty good, but the star of the show is <a href="http://birdland.camp">Birdland</a>, which won six XYZZYs. I&#39;ve played it, and it really is that good. It&#39;s funny and heartfelt and touching, and you should all just go play it right now if you haven&#39;t already. Don&#39;t worry: it&#39;s pretty short. His Known Unknowns is in the running this year, and it&#39;ll probably do well.<br><br>I didn&#39;t play a lot of last year&#39;s winners (you can go through them all on the site), but I <i>did</i> play <a href="http://ifarchive.smallwhitehouse.org/if-archive/games/competition2016/16%20Ways%20to%20Kill%20a%20Vampire%20at%20McDonalds/Vampire%20%2843%29.html">16 Ways to Kill a Vampire at McDonalds</a>, which had a lot of fun puzzles and was pretty entertaining.<br><br>This year, we had <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=uq18rw9gt8j58da">Wizard Sniffer</a> which is pretty funny, but it&#39;s also a more traditional bit of IF. True, it&#39;s not as Evil and Badly Designed as a lot of oldschool IF was (like Zork: oh man, that game actually WAS evil), but it still might be a bit intimidating.<br><br>Finally, Chandler Groover&#39;s stuff is almost always pretty good. But it can be kinda NSFW and weird.</p>

            <p>In one of the bewilderingly long articles about Civ, they wrote this:<br><br><i>Since the end of World War II, the situation has been much different. While small wars have certainly continued to be fought, two proverbial “great powers” haven’t met one another directly on a battlefield since 1945: <b>that’s 73 years as I write these words, a record for all of post-classical human history</b>. As the political scientist Robert Jervis could write already in 1988, “the most striking characteristic of the postwar period is just that — it can be called ‘postwar’ because the major powers have not fought each other since 1945. Such a lengthy period of peace among the most powerful states is unprecedented.” The change is so marked that historians have come up with a name for the period stretching from 1945 to the present: “The Long Peace.”</i><br><br>Emphasis added. Say whaaaaat? Surely in 1500 years of history we&#39;ve managed more than 70 years without two great powers directly fighting! More research was needed, clearly.<br><br>Well... I can&#39;t actually reach the Classical era. My understanding of power dynamics in pre-Norman Conquest Europe is severely limited. Actually I&#39;m not too hot on the 500 years after that, but luckily there was this whole string of Crusades, which I figure count.<br><br>So I put together a spreadsheet, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qOTsr8eRNLdcmcKCma9jmgLSFbD1kn-GuLB6kYhbPjY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. It&#39;s not complete. It focusses almost entirely on European wars, or wars between Europe and the Ottoman Empire/the Crusades. It&#39;s probably left out a lot of wars between countries that I don&#39;t know if they count as &#39;Great&#39; (was Hungary a &#39;Great Power&#39; in 1127 when they fought the Byzantines?) but it&#39;s enough to answer the question:<br><br>Between 1095 and 1945, the longest period of peace between Great Powers was 48 years, following the First Crusade. Between 1500 and 1871, we never went longer than 20 years of &#39;peace&#39;.<br><br>War! What is it good for? Well, based on the data, apparently everyone loves it!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My understanding is that the European wars mostly weren&#39;t about moving your population into an area; they were about asserting your own control over the population already there. So for instance the English kings didn&#39;t want to wipe out the populace of France and send over settlers - they wanted to take in the taxes and tribute from France&#39;s current population.<br><br>In the days before my chart, I think you&#39;re correct; the Saxon and Viking invasions of Britain (and everywhere else) were driven by population pressure. But once you had a secure financial system and all-powerful kings, it seems to me that those factors mostly drove the wars.<br><br>Another piece of evidence in that direction is the number of XXXXX Succession wars bouncing around on the list. It wasn&#39;t about who lived on the land, but who ruled it...<br><br>hS</p>

I thought I&#39;d bring this back one more time.<br><br><b>The News</b><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XUtHnOv.png"><br><br>After fifteen -- fifteen! -- years, the Discworld fan-film (if you can even still call something that features Rob Wilkins as Executive Producer a fan-film) <i>Troll Bridge</i> is finally ready for release! The official trailer has dropped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJIaTBB72CM">here</a>, and you can also see their website <a href="http://www.trollbridge.film/">here</a>.<br><br>If you want a copy for yourself, apparently they&#39;re in a weird position where they can only take money while they&#39;re still able to spend it on the film. That means that it&#39;s essentially pre-order only. You can find the options <a href="https://troll-bridge.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders/23052">here</a>.<br><br>(My thanks to <a href="http://discworldmonthly.co.uk/">Discworld Monthly</a> for letting me know about this; I&#39;ve been receiving it for close to two decades now, and it&#39;s great for dropping tidbits like this.)<br><br><b>The Missions</b><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tKuCz3A.png"><br><br>The PPC has a long history with the Discworld, and it all began when the Original Series was kicked off Fanfiction.net. Suddenly, Jay and Acacia were no longer constrained by the rule that your story had to be set in a single fandom. Pretty much immediately, they transferred their agents to the Department of Implausible Crossovers; a couple of missions later, they paid their first visit to the Disc.<br><br><a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission20.html">The Luggage Runs Off With the One Ring</a><br><br>There haven&#39;t been all that many other missions onto the Disc. I did a few, and there&#39;s a handful from random people, but I&#39;m going to link here to the only other team who&#39;s done more than one mission into the continuum:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1LfX-_uLtQbggmfXda1b5cT4co9p8pFi50wsKsDfmc/edit">A Promise To Be Kept</a> stars the ever-famous Agents Trojie and Pads, along with July and Library. Confession: I haven&#39;t actually read it. I intend to fix that today. ^_^<br><br><b>The OFU</b><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mYywxCx.png"><br><br>There is an <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9130619/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Discworld">Official Fanfiction University of Discworld</a>, written by me. It&#39;s one of the very few completed OFUs, and yes, I do someday plan to do a sequel. (To my knowledge, no-one has <i>ever</i> completed an OFU sequel, so...)<br><br><b>The Work-in-Progress</b><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2WJeHCI.png"><br><br>I actually have a PPC story with a bit of a Discworld bent in the works. Here&#39;s a snippet, though be aware that I have <i>no</i> idea when I&#39;m going to finish it:<br><br><i>It&#39;s a grand life for the Nac Mac Feegle clan here in the Headquarters o&#39;the bigjobs&#39; PPC. There&#39;s nae beasties to hassle ye, nae lawyers to go writin&#39; yer name, and nae Quin o&#39;th&#39;Fairies sneakin&#39; in every Friday night. Well… that is to say, the mini-beasties are quite friendly, the lawyers never leave their lair, and the Fair Folk are all agents who never have time to play their tricks. It comes out to the same thing, ye ken?</i><br><br><b>The Fannish Idea</b><br><br>I ran across this a few days ago, and was quite taken with the idea: <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/books-comics/discworld/57879/terry-pratchett-s-discworld-ripe-for-a-cinematic-universe">what if the Discworld became a Cinematic Universe?</a><br><br>The page plots out four phases, 22 films spanning the length and breadth of the <i>Discworld</i> series. I like the fact that they&#39;re willing to take a few liberties with the timeline to make the series work - for instance, they have <i>The Colour of Magic</i> as the seventh movie, after Rincewind has already been introduced - but I think they might take it too far at times. The idea of Tiffany Aching playing Agnes Nitt&#39;s role in <i>Carpe Jugulum</i> doesn&#39;t sit well with me, partly because Agnes is a very cool character, but also because it means seriously messing with Tiffany&#39;s very tightly-plotted arc; their <i>Carpe</i> takes place after Tiffany has only had two films, so she&#39;s still very early in her witchery.<br><br>I do like the way they&#39;ve pretty much used the Susan books as the end-of-phase teamups. I don&#39;t know if it was intentional, but that&#39;s how it falls out, and I think it works. Susan has a habit of dragging in other characters.<br><br>On the flip-side, I&#39;m not at all fond of the &#39;every mid-credits sting leads directly into the next movie&#39; conceit. They clearly had fun with it, but they also had to stretch badly for some of them. The biggest one is that they frame <i>Small Gods</i> with two scenes establishing it as a story told by Mightily Oats to Tiffany, which... fine, I guess, but given that it contains almost <i>no</i> characters with actual relevance, I don&#39;t see the point. (What you&#39;d actually use <i>Small Gods</i> for, in addition to &#39;for its own benefit&#39;, is to establish the character of Lu-Tze and the History Monks. They already make cameos, so amplify that and set things up for <i>Thief of Time</i>.)<br><br>Ultimately, it&#39;s clearly an idea they&#39;ve put some thought into. They allow for their actors to rotate out, carefully bringing Tiffany in late to fill the young-hero Spiderman role, and the overall narrative they&#39;re telling holds at least vaguely together. The biggest issue, though, is that unlike comics (where the source material has been changed countless times already), the Discworld is a single series with a defined plot. I don&#39;t know that the fanbase would appreciate the drastic changes they propose, and I don&#39;t know that you could sell <i>Guards! Guards!</i> (their first movie) to an audience that didn&#39;t know it already. <br><br>Ultimately, assuming the estate would even allow such monkeying, I think the whole thing would swing on the actors. Much like Robert Downey Jr carried the MCU through to the first <i>Avengers</i>, whoever played Sam Vimes would need to be similarly amazing.<br><br>hS <img src="https://i.imgur.com/na7efMQ.png"></p>

            <p>Terry Pratchett was a massive fan of The Elder Scrolls, especially Oblivion (and perhaps later Skyrim). He was fascinated by the modding scenes of the games, and even made writing contributions to some mods he liked (namely, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/28977">Vilja</a> and her <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26393/">Skyrim varient</a>).<br><br>Figured that was worth sharing.</p>

            <p>More specifically: start with <i>Guards! Guards!</i>, as the first City Watch book. It introduces the city of Ankh-Morpork, which will become more and more the centre of the series as you get further in.<br><br>After that... well, you <i>can</i> jump straight to <i>Men at Arms</i>, that shouldn&#39;t cause any problems. But you could also side-step to one of the other sets of characters, by moving to <i>Wyrd Sisters</i> (for the Witches), <i>Mort</i> (for Death), or <i>Sourcery</i> (for the Wizards). The further you get in the series, the more interlinked they get; I&#39;d recommend shuffling the order of everything up to <i>Men at Arms</i> (book 15) according to taste and desire, but making sure you&#39;ve read all* of those first 15 before picking up <i>Soul Music</i> and carrying on in publication order.<br><br>*&#39;All&#39; doesn&#39;t really need to include <i>The Colour of Magic</i>, <i>The Light Fantastic</i>, or <i>Equal Rites</i>, which have a rather different feel than the rest of the series. You can also skip <i>Eric</i>, which was originally written to be a shorter, illustrated book. It&#39;s not <i>bad</i>, but it&#39;s not a very strong story, and it doesn&#39;t add anything much.<br><br>So the sub-series to keep &#39;in order&#39; before book 16 are:<br><br>The Watch: Guards! Guards! - Men at Arms<br>The Witches: Wyrd Sisters - Witches Abroad - Lords and Ladies<br>The Wizards: Sourcery - (Eric) - Moving Pictures<br>Death: Mort - Reaper Man<br>Standalones: Pyramids - Small Gods<br><br>You can mix between the serieseseses as much as you please, though (though reading <i>Moving Pictures</i> before <i>Lords and Ladies</i> is probably valuable.)<br><br>Oh, and for much further down the line: somewhere between <i>The Last Continent</i> and <i>Unseen Academicals</i> you should work in at least the fiction halves of the four <i>Science of Discworld</i> books. They&#39;re also excellent popular science books, particularly the first one, but the fiction halves are part of the main storyline. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hello all. I would like to assure you first that your suspicions about zdimentia and myself being the same person are indeed false. She and I have been in discussion about this for the past two weeks, and I read the backlog. <br><br>While I don’t have a full understanding of your community or its rules admittedly, I have read the backlogs that are available, and have discussed things with her at pretty great lengths. I understand some of the group dynamics that were at play. Not all of them, but enough. This has obviously disturbed their life a great deal, and I do sympathize. <br><br>That being said, I have posted some of the messages she has written directly, and have one more to post, which is why some of the things I posted here were in her voice. I do have another message to post of hers, and I really do hope that you will be willing to consider it at least. There’s no way to force things, but if you would at least hear her out, this may be a resolvable matter without further heartache on either side:<br><br>Myth could explain how both the group and Bram misread the racism situation if you allow her to explain.  For one thing, Bram didn&#39;t deliberately ignore the request to expand on an apology.  She&#39;s upset that the group is exaggerating a misconception about what she did and won&#39;t hear the truth.</p>

            <p>...I couldn&#39;t help that one (Nony) spelled &quot;Ix&quot; as &quot;Icks&quot;, which is an incorrect spelling that couldn&#39;t exist except under two conditions. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I don&#39;t see zd as being the kind of person whose strategies extend beyond doing the same thing (meaning trying to shapeshift back onto the Board) over and over, meaning that she likely wouldn&#39;t do that on purpose. That misspelling in particular sounds just about right to have been gained through word-of-mouth conversation.<br><br>So, at least in one case, could these things they say to introduce themselves be true? Is zdimensia, at least in one case, not trying to sneak on the Board again, but rather siccing her friends on us, or maybe just telling all her friends about what happened so that they&#39;ll by nature come to the Board to attack us?<br><br>Again, correct me if I&#39;m wrong. I don&#39;t know the whole situation here, and honestly, I don&#39;t want to know more than I already have witnessed. Just posing an alternate theory.<br><br>Also, the thing with Palindrome, and how it sorta reflected my own little &quot;I&#39;m so like zd&quot; breakdown in front of hS after realizing I did something pretty wrong (but largely inconsequential) a long time ago, still troubles me. I highly doubt that we ourselves are portraying her as such, but I get the feeling that from witnessing what happens when zdimensia comes back/assigns a friend to do the work, some newbies may get the subconscious impression that she&#39;s sort of the designated villain of the Board, to be treated as either pure evil (perhaps as the villain of a PPC fic, serious or not serious - I also thought of her this way at the time, and the similarities to me were &quot;signs&quot; that I &quot;wasn&#39;t pure enough to stay&quot;) or as an unsung martyr. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything we can do in the way we treat her and the subject of her to make these things change, but I will tell you that I intend to craft a new &quot;Board villain&quot; from whole cloth. This new one has already played an indirect role in the shipfest fic &quot;Man on a Mission&quot;, as you will see when the full version is released, and I intend to have her make appearances in other Board events. So if you start noticing that the fictional badfic author keeps showing up in a lot of different posts of mine, this is why. Oh, and if there is anything we can do otherwise, do say so. I probably am going to go through with the &quot;new Board villain&quot; character no matter what, as she&#39;s kind of an interesing concept, although I&#39;m willing to be talked into the idea that she might not exactly be &quot;the new Board villain&quot;.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>First, the &quot;Icks&quot; misspelling doesn&#39;t sound like one made from word of mouth to me, especially when Ix isn&#39;t exactly inactive on the board. The correct spelling was present. That makes the &quot;Icks&quot; spelling seem more like an insult. Ick, specifically.<br><br>If Zd is siccing her friends on us, then it&#39;s no better than what she did already.<br><br>More than anything else, though, designating someone as a villain is a bad idea. Real people should not be villains. Even if it isn&#39;t Bram being used as the villain, the Board is mostly the interactions of real people, so that risks crossing a line you probably shouldn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>Twisted, I think you&#39;re overanalyzing this a little bit.

            <p>Also, about the Board villain thing, sorry if the pronouns and other things were unclear: the new villain I have come up with is nothing like zd or anyone related to her, she just happens to also be female. You&#39;re right, it would be a really bad thing to vilify zd, and that was kind of my point there (that younger users could have been coming to uninformed conclusions about zd: either that zd is the iconic arch-nemesis of the Board or that zd is someone that we&#39;re unfairly punishing.)<br><br>But anyway, if the idea of me having a recurring arch-nemesis who&#39;s entirely fictional pop up in a lot of events I participate in for our badficcer selves and maybe some agents in RPs to fight, in order to prevent the risk of someone placing zdimensia in that role in a joke badfic (at the least), sounds like a good idea, I would like to go through and do it. If not, this character will just be another recurring fictional badficcer who&#39;s hostile to the PPC but doesn&#39;t really attempt to sabotage it outside of joke narratives that I wholly control.

            <p>I decided to make a good few of my pending badfic selves (and one past one, NightmareTwisteyTheDemonFoxAnimatonic) literal alternate universe versions of me, with the explanation that I (as my online self) have been screwing around with interdimensional travel. The Board villain is one of those, from an alternate universe that caused her to turn out... maybe not evil, but at the least the kind of person you don&#39;t want to encounter online.

            <p>And FYI, Bramandin and/or &quot;Myth Creant&quot; has been trying to contact some of us by e-mail, sometimes asking for other people&#39;s contact information. So far, no one I&#39;m aware of has responded, and I think that&#39;s the right thing to do. Just don&#39;t respond at all. <i>Particularly</i> don&#39;t give out anyone&#39;s contact information without their consent.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Twisted, I think you&#39;re overanalyzing this a little bit.

            <p>One would more accurately say that negotiations ended due to Bramandin being completely unwilling to compromise on a list of demands that were, frankly, ridiculous.  They basically want to re-hash every interaction we&#39;ve ever had with them (until everyone agrees what happened and why), revoke the ban (not part of their original list, but got added in later), and set up a new PPC-esque world for them.  The important thing to know is that they threatened to come back and resume their campaign of terror if I didn&#39;t change my mind and give them the full list.  So, we&#39;ll see them again.<br><br>I have company over at the moment, I will fill you all in  more fully later.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going cover the entire email chain, partially because it isn&#39;t a chain (zdimensia kept sending separate emails, rather than responding in-line), and partly because I have already spent more than enough time looking at this.  So, here are excerpts.<br><br>zdimensia&#39;s list of demands:<br><br><blockquote>This isn&#39;t a complete wishlist, and I realize that I won&#39;t unconditionally get everything, but I do have some ideas.  Most of it involves trying to keep this from happening again to anyone else.  I will take suggestions.<br><br>What I’m asking for may sound counterintuitive to what you(group) think I need, but don’t knock it until it’s tried.  Remember that my brain works in fundamentally different ways than yours, what you’ve done hasn’t worked, and I might actually know what’s best.<br><br>A little bit later, there are some members that I’d like private mediation with.<br><br>{Very Strong Desire}<br><br>I would like my full story made available on the wiki so that it&#39;s easier to read than relying on the archives.  (Or the entire thing would be somewhere else and an abridged version go on the wiki.)  Hopefully we (me, the people who were there, and anyone who’s interested in reading the archives) can agree on a truth in between our versions of what happened.  The purpose behind this is that I want it examined for mistakes on both sides and maybe we can get some insight on how to handle a problem like me in the future.  I actually have some ideas for adjustments to the rules and guidelines that should be at least considered.  This will take months at least to set up.  Whatever discussion space is used, I would prefer a different software than webapps.  (I don’t know if there is something free that works like <a href="https://www.writingforums.org/general-writing/"><a href="https://www.writingforums.org/general-writing/">https://www.writingforums.org/general-writing/</a></a> or if setting up a private subreddit would be a good idea.  There’s probably a really easy solution that I don’t know about.  What I’m after is for slow conversations because I don’t process things immediately.  Also it would help if each point could be addressed as its own topic.)<br><br>When the story is complete, I request that some people who made mistakes to publicly acknowledge what they should do if something similar happens.  There are some posts that I would like examined for whether they were wrong or right.  I will of course be apologizing for a lot of things during this time.  (If you need to point out apologizing for the wrong things, please be constructive and not mean.)<br><br>{Strong Desire}<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed that the FAQ has been rewritten recently.  Unless there was a point to having the Permission Process be confusing, I would like to contribute a Gdoc rewrite  that would help make it clearer.  I made almost all of the possible mistakes and have spent time thinking about why they happened.<br><br>{Very Strong Desire}<br><br>I would like it acknowledged that I was a good enough writer to get Permission if I hadn’t made so many mistakes.  (Confirm with Laburnum who read a mission.  Or I could freshly polish a proper request either from last summer or 2014.)  It wasn’t that I couldn’t take concrit, it was that I took it without understanding it and got into an unworkable jam.  SamuriIreland did say that I’m not difficult to work with during betaing.<br><br>{Somewhat Strong Desire}<br><br>Since there is no risk in telling the truth now, I’d like an honest discussion about whether it would have been possible for me to be in board-space once everyone was calm. <br><br>To add to that, anyone who complained about the way I took concrit, how about some tips about how to do it better?<br><br>{Needs a convincing argument to be rejected}<br><br>I do enjoy reading PPC stories.  I would like wiki access so that if I find a story that should be linked to an article or a minor inconsistency, I could go in and make positive minor adjustments.  I realize that this one should cause some hesitation, but the problem was the board-space and my tendency to act like a mirror.  I should be fine if I&#39;m not interacting in that environment.  Plus, my punishment has been served.  This of course would be taken away if I don&#39;t behave.<br><br>{Somewhat strong desire}<br><br>This is volunteer dependent, but I would like to create a PPC-like world and I don’t know which elements I can steal from the PPC universe.  This could be shared with anyone who wants to work there instead of the PPC.  I would like help with that if possible.  Also, I don’t know if I have 30 Legacy of Kain missions drafted, but I do have a lot of stories to rewrite and it is very difficult to find a beta for this genre.  I would like help if that is possible.  Most people I’ve talked to away from the board aren’t that bad outside of that space.<br><br>I would like my co-write offer left up.  If there are no takers in a year or two, it can go in author-requested missions.  I just don’t have the skill to handle that one.  (It has been recommended as goodfic, but there are still enough bad parts to make a mission, I think.)</blockquote>
<br><br>That was the starting point.  In order for us to get zdimensia to leave for good, we would have to spend quite a bit more time dealing with them directly.  Not too keen on that idea, given how every attempt to talk with them directly has gone.<br><br>Now, there were other emails in there.  One in which zdimensia claims that Neshomeh needs help before she hurts anyone else.  <br><br>Another email came down the line requesting apologies to Mythcreant and Nony.  I explained, again, that either they are, in fact, sock puppets or they were an attempt to get around the ban via a second person.  Either way, no apology was warranted, and none would be given.  However, if either of these people wanted to contact me, they could.  What I got back was a lot of reasons I wouldn&#39;t hear from Nony, and a lot of dragging of feet in regards to Mythcreant.  I assume this means zdimensia only has the one extra email, at the moment.<br><br>At that point, I decided to stop being distracted by the side issues, and reply to the list of demands.<br><br><blockquote>I want you to go away forever.  That is what I want.  I never want to have to think about you ever again.  To that end, here is the compromise on your list of demands.<br><br>- We won&#39;t rehash the events of the last few years, because I don&#39;t believe we will ever agree on what happened and why.  We will compromise by letting you submit your written version of events for us to put on the wiki page with the archives.<br><br>- Submit your document for the Permission article.  I can even guarantee that people other than me will read it, but not that the article will change because of it.<br><br>- I acknowledge that you got Permission as Bramandin.  It has since been revoked because of the banning, but no one is denying that you got Permission before you were banned.<br><br>- No Wiki access.  That is an explicit part of being banned.<br><br>- We can&#39;t stop you from writing your own non-PPC thing, so go ahead, but don&#39;t expect any help from us.  As long as it is distinctly different from the PPC, why should we care?  And don&#39;t just change the names.  That&#39;s lazy and someone else already tried that once.<br><br>- We will leave the co-write request up.<br><br>- I will not be passing any messages on to individuals in the group.  Most of the people you want to speak to have already expressed that they don&#39;t wish to hear from you.<br><br><br>That is what we can give you.  All we ask in return is that you never try to re-enter a PPC space, that you do not contact any of our members, and that you do not send any representative to contact the group on your behalf.</blockquote>
<br><br>Not good enough.<br><br><blockquote>Not really good enough.  <br><br>I don&#39;t want your vague apology to be the only acknowledgment of wrongdoing.  I want enough of my hurts and suffering displayed and acknowledged until it&#39;s undeniable that it happened and that it was bad enough to ruin my life.  I want every lie to be countered with truth so that the group understands what it did.  I want it burned into memory so that you do not do it again.  Except for the people you won&#39;t acknowledge exist, I&#39;m probably not the only one you&#39;ve hurt.  I will not go quietly.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you acknowledged that some rules should be examined.<br><br>It will take a while for me to write the permission document, and I would like a call for volunteers to beta it before it leaves my control.  Then I want it displayed publicly so that everyone active at the time can review it and decide if they want any of the changes to take effect.<br><br>I argue that a full ban was undeserved at any point.  Most of it was because of lies and misunderstandings.<br><br>I said that it needed to be a convincing argument.  I didn&#39;t even deserve to be banned for as long as I was, much less permabanned.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to create a new sandbox unless you call for volunteers.  I won&#39;t rewrite any of my stories to be non-PPC before publishing without volunteers at least asked for.  This should be accompanied by how I&#39;m not as bad as you(group) have made me out to be.<br><br>Thanks for at least leaving the co-write request up.<br><br><b>[Line Redacted by Phobos]</b><br><br>On a tangent about wrongdoing and banning, I don&#39;t think I ever got to properly explain the racism and what was thought to be neo-nazi support.  By the strict definition, I&#39;m not really a racist.  I don&#39;t hate black people for being black, think that they&#39;re less-than anyone else because of it, or work to oppress them.  I got mixed up about what racism really means, and I&#39;m less racist than Barid.  Did you get a year&#39;s ban for writing him?  The neo-nazi stuff was a complete misunderstanding, and I&#39;m quite the opposite.  I don&#39;t even think having a lapsed Jew character was cultural appropriation enough for more than a demand to change it.  I want the original ban re-examined.</blockquote>
<br><br>I would like to especially draw attention to this line: &quot;I want enough of my hurts and suffering displayed and acknowledged until it&#39;s undeniable that it happened and that it was bad enough to ruin my life.  I want every lie to be countered with truth so that the group understands what it did.  I want it burned into memory so that you do not do it again.&quot;<br><br>That tells me that no amount of compromise was ever going to be enough.  It was all or nothing, and they were negotiating in bad faith.<br><br>So, now we go back to playing Whack-a-Mole every time zdimensia pops up.  I also think it is a good idea, going forward, to simply ban them and delete their posts without comment.  We&#39;ve done what we can, and they are basically just trying to terrorize us, now.  The last thing they said before I blocked them was &quot;You change your mind or you&#39;ll be seeing me the next time I move.&quot;<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m sure we&#39;re going to hear about how terrible a person I am, but you know what?  I don&#39;t particularly care.  I have only a limited number of f***s to give, and I am not wasting them on zdimensia.<br><br>-Phobos<br><br>ps - There is a redacted line and some bits missing from my explanation.  Those involved a member of the community that has made it abundantly clear that they want nothing to do with this, so I took those bits out.  I only point them out now so that I do not get accused of hiding important evidence or something.</p>

            <p>-Any post in any thread dated more recently than agreement to this proposal, which names or explicitly alludes to Zdimensia under any name (including her purported meat-puppets Mythcreant and Nony, and this third-party Anonymous) will be deleted (if Zdimensia is the primary topic) or silently edited (if she is a minor point), at the Nameless Admin&#39;s discretion.<br><br>--&#39;Silently edited&#39; means no NA comment will be left to mark the change and provoke a long discussion of it.<br><br>--Where either action is taken against a current member of the PPC, the Nameless Admin has the responsibility of contacting them off-Board (email, Discord message, or Wiki message) and explaining what was done, and enough of the background to say why. This shall not, of course, be viewed as a breach of the Constitution by the person posting, unless they&#39;re clearly doing it to cause trouble.<br><br>-Any user confessing to being Zdimensia, or to joining for the sole purpose of discussion Zdimensia, will be blocked as a banned user. Their confession will be deleted (but archived by the NA), and replaced with a simple note that a previous ban has been enforced, and the NA should be contacted by another means if details are needed.<br><br>-If someone strongly suspects that another user is a Zdimensia sock, they should contact the Nameless Admin. The Nameless Admin should then obtain an email address for the suspect and ask them directly about their identity. Zdimensia has not, previously, shown much propensity for lying when directly asked, probably because her causus belli is linked to her identity. A confession should be treated as above.<br><br>This isn&#39;t perfect, I know, and you absolutely should rip it to pieces and rework it. But it&#39;s much better than the status quo, which is &#39;NA deletes and then we rip the Board apart asking why&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know what to think here, honestly. I agree with these proposals in response to Zdimensia and only Zdimensia, but I can&#39;t help worrying that it could set a bad precedent. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to lead, slippery-slope style, to outright censorship of everything anyone says on the Board, but the idea of deleting everything posted about a specific user from here on out just doesn&#39;t sit well with me.<br><br>However, I recognize that what&#39;s happened here will just keep happening. Zdimensia will, in all probability, continue to either evade the ban outright; advocate for herself under different usernames; harass people she believes to be responsible for her ban across several slices of the Internet outside of the Board; and/or find friends to advocate for her. None of these behaviors are acceptable, and to my knowledge, Zdimensia is the only person who&#39;s done all of these things. This proposal would almost certainly be effective at stopping all of this, which I think it&#39;s safe to say is a goal we all ultimately share. Less drama is always good.<br><br>To be perfectly clear, then: <b>I am not voting either way on this proposal.</b> This post is meant to just lay out my thoughts on the matter and possibly spur some good discussion. With that being said, I think the proposal needs to be amended.<br><br>As I understand it, the Nameless Admin has blocked a rather large set of IP addresses in an effort to stop Zdimensia from evading the ban. If this proposal goes into effect, I think that that blanket IP ban would be unnecessary and should therefore be removed.</p>

            <p>Those banned IP addresses are the only reason zdimensia is not popping up several times a day.  If you want their new tactic to be bombarding the Board so fast that they overwhelm the Nameless Admin then, by all means, remove the IP bans.  I don&#39;t think that is a situation we want to find ourselves in, so the IP bans should probably stay.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Contrary to rumour, there hasn&#39;t actually been a mass blocking of groups of IP addresses.

Since we obviously won&#39;t ever agree on the truthfulness of any abridged version, this page should just consist of a very short explanation of the reason why it exists, and a list of links to every archived thread that involved zdimensia, Bramandin etc. If the community agrees that we should have this page, I may volunteer to set it up.<br><br>On a related note, I noticed that Bramandin&#39;s agents and their missions vanished from the wiki.

            <p>Here is the original message that was supposed to be changed by the messenger... It got mistranslated.<br><br>I was approached by someone that you&#39;ve hurt, and she&#39;s still in a lot of pain. I think that you should actually resolve the bad blood between you. There is a resolution that wouldn&#39;t necessarily mean that she becomes unbanned, but it will probably get rid of her.  <br><br>(That means that you should give her something that she actually wants, and to figure that out you should talk to Mythcreant. )<br><br>For one thing, stop lying that the original ban was due process or that anything that happened since then was fair.

            <p>So not &#39;recently&#39;.<br><br>If she is not asking for her ban to be lifted, there is no reason for the community as a whole to have any sort of discussion with her. The PPC community, and most of its members, consider the issue &#39;resolved&#39; - she was determined by majority vote to have no place in this community, and that was the end of the matter. The only official business we have with her is &#39;is she allowed in this community?&#39;, and it appears we agree that the answer is &#39;no&#39;.<br><br>If any individuals wish to communicate with her, by this proposed means or any other, they are and always have been free to do so.<br><br>Extended discussion on this matter would be increasingly disruptive; I propose that you, &#39;Anonymous&#39;, leave some method for off-Board communication with you or some other relevant party, and that there be no other replies to this thread.<br><br>If, of course, any members of the PPC community feels that we are in need of yet another extended debate on the subject, they are, as always, free to say as much. I am not a moderator, and my opinion is just that - my opinion.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: If you would like to pass on a message, please tell her that I hope she has a wonderful life, and that she soon can get over this unhealthy fixation on a small internet community which has made it clear she is not welcome. ~hS</p>

            <p><i>(Disclaimer and warning: the Italian is swearing. So be prepared for that if you decide to translate it.)</i><br><br>Ce’rana of Borune yelped as another tense shift rocked the ground, throwing her out of the tree she’d been perched in. She didn’t quite land on her feet properly and lurched to the right, barely catching herself before she cracked her skull on the uneven ground.<br><br>Alexander Hawke had also been tossed to the ground, but he landed awkwardly when the shift sent him into the tree Ce’rana had been sitting in from his place near the roots. There was a clearly-audible crack when he connected, like the splintering of bark.<br><br>Ce’rana looked over, expecting to see the damaged bark crumbling off the tree and preparing herself to make sure it would be alright; instead, she discovered that Alex had gained a second elbow. In the opposite direction and in the middle of his forearm. <i>How odd,</i> she thought in the moments time seemed to slow to a crawl. <i>It almost looks as though Alex is hurt. But he never gets hurt.</i><br><br>Alex looked at her, his eyes following the direction of her gaze until he spotted his double-bent arm. “Huh. I wonder why it doesn’t hurt?” He tried to move his arm, then doubled over as the break decided that now was the time to start hurting. Thanks ever so, IO. <i>“Figlio di puttana!”</i><br><br>Ce’rana immediately bolted over to her partner, trying to grab the RA as she went and failing. “Alright, that is <i>definitely</i> a bad thing,” she muttered as she tried to look the break over without hurting him more.<br><br><i>“Cazzo!</i> Of course it’s a bad thing. My arm’s broken.” Despite the swearing Alex seemed relatively calm. <br><br>“Yes, I know that. That would be why it’s bad,” Ce’rana snapped, glaring up at him for a moment for his lack of care. “Especially since I wasn’t sure that your bones even <i>could</i> break with how much pressure you seem to shrug off every other mission.”<br><br>Alex bit back a reply about enough things snapping already without her tone adding to the list, then looked down at his arm. “You don’t know how to do a splint, do you?”<br><br>The Dryad shook her head. “I was a scribe, not a doctor. Beyond that, I was the firstborn of a noble, and a female at that. Even further beyond, a Dryad. At no point was I given the chance to learn that, even if I had the inclination to do so.”<br><br>“Rana… What part of ‘my arm is broken’ sounds like ‘give me a genealogy lesson?’ Because I don’t think this is the best time.”<br><br>She bit her lip and glanced away. “Of course. My apologies. The point is, no, I do not know how to make a splint.”<br><br>Alex frowned. “First, get a pair of relatively straight sticks…” <br><br>One impromptu lesson later, Alex’s arm was at least not in danger of breaking further. Ce’rana smiled ever-so-slightly at the fact that she’d managed to do something practical and useful, even if she’d needed to be talked through every single step, occasionally more than once. “Alright. Now, where did the RA go…”<br><br>Alex shook his head. “We still have a mission to do.”<br><br>She fixed him with a Look, now trying to find the RA in her bag by touch alone. “Alex, I am not going to allow you to continue without spending a few minutes in Medical to get that fixed. I have lasted on missions without you for longer, and there is nothing of particular danger coming up save for further tense shifts and timeskips, which we both know I can handle.” The tiny agent chose to ignore the fact that her stomach very much could not. “I will be fine, and you will go to Medical for a very short while, and we will continue our mission from there.”<br><br>He sighed. “I’m coming right back, you know that right?”<br><br>She smiled at him and patted his unbroken arm. “Of course you are. Just as soon as your arm is fixed.”<br><br>Alex shook his head and reached into her pack, trying to help her find the RA. “Not like this is the worst break I’ve ever had.”<br><br>Ce’rana blinked. “I suppose I should not be surprised at that,” she admitted as she turned back to the search in full, “but I am.”<br><br>He chuckled. “What about you?”<br><br>She shook her head. “No, I never broke anything. Not for lack of trying on my brothers’ parts, though - and Korus was the only one who ever came away with any serious injuries. Even then, it was… more than rare.”<br><br>“Sounds like you were lucky.” Alex pulled out the RA, then held it out to her. “Can’t really use it one handed.”<br><br>The tiny agent nodded, took it, and punched in the coordinates for Medical. “Dryads do not fall from trees easily,” she said with a small smile once the portal had opened, “and my brothers never did figure out how to hold onto me when I wanted to get away. Now go get your arm fixed. You know how to find me in this place.”</p>

            <p><i>June 2010, joint mission, Agents Dawn McKenna and T&#39;Zar (DOGA) with Agent Abaddon. Dawn is seventeen:</i><br><br><br>&quot;You&#39;re <i>joking</i>,&quot; Abaddon said. &quot;You&#39;ve been an agent for <i>how</i> long, now?&quot;<br><br>Dawn glared at him. She&#39;d liked him well enough the first few times they&#39;d met. Right now, though, she could only think sourly that she wished he&#39;d stayed far away from T&#39;Zar after the Vulcan was repartnered with her. &quot;Three years.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Three years, and you&#39;ve never broken a bone!&quot; Abaddon laughed. He even looked stupid, Dawn decided, with his stupid punk look and his stupid floppy hair and the stupid little <i>braid</i> in his floppy hair. &quot;How does it feel?&quot;<br><br>Forget everything: Dawn picked up the nearest object and threw it at him. &quot;It <i>hurts</i>, you moron! What do you <i>think</i>?&quot; She was tearing up again, half from frustration. Why wasn&#39;t T&#39;Zar back yet? Abaddon had managed to find the regular strength painkillers, but neither of them knew how to set a broken bone in anything more than theory. Which left Dawn stuck leaning against the wall with a broken leg supported by their packs, and only a stupid, laughing nineteen-year-old <i>boy</i> for company.<br><br>&quot;Sorry, sorry,&quot; Abaddon said. He&#39;d managed to catch the notebook she&#39;d thrown; now he set it aside and cautiously moved to sit next to her. &quot;I&#39;m a prat sometimes.&quot;<br><br>Dawn looked away, trying to blink back tears. It didn&#39;t work. &quot;You are.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I really am,&quot; Abaddon agreed. Quite awkwardly, he put an arm around her shoulders. &quot;T&#39;Zar should be back soon. She&#39;ll know what to do--and she&#39;s got the RA.&quot;<br><br>Dawn sniffled, and could barely bring herself to hate that she&#39;d done it. &quot;The painkillers aren&#39;t working.&quot;<br><br>Abaddon winced. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. And I&#39;m sorry I laughed before--it&#39;s just, I broke my first bone before I even became an agent, so it&#39;s...&quot; He glanced at her. &quot;Not funny, not at all, just different--&quot;<br><br>Dawn closed her eyes, and tried to pretend she wasn&#39;t leaning into him. She didn&#39;t even <i>like</i> him anymore: he was just T&#39;Zar&#39;s annoying ex-partner, who looked and sometimes sounded a bit too much like the latest Doctor for his own good (which...made absolutely no sense, come to think of it. He&#39;d said something about fancasting, when she&#39;d idly commented that he was really kind of the new Doctor in blond and black, but had anyone even known Matt Smith before this role? Well, some people must have, she thought. Just because <i>she</i> hadn&#39;t heard of him didn&#39;t mean no one had.)<br><br>&quot;Go on,&quot; she said dully. She needed a distraction from wondering how much longer T&#39;Zar would be, and she now knew from experience that Abaddon could talk <i>forever</i> if no one stopped him. &quot;What&#39;s the story there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, well.&quot; Abaddon shrugged and pulled one knee up, resting his free arm on it. &quot;I was a kid--only about eleven, I think--and we were visiting my uncle. He&#39;s brilliant, my uncle--have I ever--? No? Another time. Anyway, my mum and dad were being boring with him, so I thought I&#39;d go exploring. Clambered over everything, like some sort of ibex--or, you know, like a young idiot.&quot; He shifted, rolling his shoulder. &quot;I fell, obviously. My balance wasn&#39;t as good as I thought it was back then.&quot; He glanced at Dawn. &quot;Rolled down a hill, hit a tree, and then just lay there screaming for a bit. I thought I&#39;d broken my neck, but it was really just my collarbone.&quot;<br><br>Dawn made a face, eyes opening again. &quot;That sounds awful.&quot; Uri had been eleven not <i>too</i> long ago; it was a little hard not to picture her little brother in Abaddon&#39;s place, especially since he did like to climb things when the family went camping. He&#39;d never broken anything doing it, but there had been some close calls...<br><br>&quot;Oh, it was,&quot; Abaddon said. &quot;Dad found me, though. Always seems to, really...anyway, he and Mum and my uncle sorted me out. Never even reached a hospital. But I didn&#39;t get to climb anything for the rest of the trip.&quot; He paused. &quot;I...I must&#39;ve scared them, really. They didn&#39;t say it in that many words, but Dad barely let me out of his sight for the rest of the day--and he usually says he doesn&#39;t actually need his eyes to keep an eye on me.&quot;<br><br>There was a brief silence before Dawn spoke again. &quot;What do your parents do, anyway? I told you about mine earlier, but you never--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dawn?&quot; T&#39;Zar was back, a tiny frown creasing the skin between her eyebrows. &quot;Why are you crying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She broke her leg,&quot; Abaddon said quickly. &quot;You know how to help with that, right? Neither of us have ever done it. Oh! I gave her painkillers, but they&#39;re too weak to do anything.&quot; He stood up, hovering while T&#39;Zar put down her bags and knelt to examine Dawn&#39;s leg. When she finished, Dawn was crying outright.<br><br>&quot;I will portal you to Medical,&quot; T&#39;Zar told her. She hesitated, then put a hand on Dawn&#39;s shoulder. She&#39;d told Dawn, on multiple occasions, that she did not understand both the human need for comfort and the idea that touch alone could give it, but here she was doing it anyway. Dawn wanted to hug her. &quot;They will have stronger painkillers, and the ability to repair the broken bone. Abaddon and I will finish the mission and meet you there.&quot;<br><br>Dawn wiped her cheeks and nodded. &quot;O-okay. Okay.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; T&#39;Zar repeated, in the dry tone that Dawn was really starting to think meant she was teasing. &quot;I have broken bones as well, Dawn. The statistical probability that you would--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, stuff the statistical probability,&quot; Abaddon said cheerfully. &quot;Your partner&#39;s in pain. Open a portal to Medical so she can get out of it, yeah?&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Zar raised an eyebrow, and pulled out the remote activator to input coordinates. &quot;I was about to do so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Course,&quot; Abaddon said. He leaned down to pat Dawn&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ll be alright. Hey, maybe we&#39;ll find you a souvenir from here! You like chips, right? They have a weirdly awful scene in a chip shop later--&quot;<br><br>Dawn barely had time to say that, yes, she did like &#39;chips,&#39; only they were called French fries where she was from, before the portal opened underneath her and deposited her on a bed in Medical with barely a centimetre&#39;s discrepancy. T&#39;Zar followed via a second portal, and stayed long enough to catch the eye of one of the Medical staff and give strict instructions regarding Dawn before disappearing through a third portal.<br><br>The staff member in question smiled down at Dawn. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, honey, we&#39;ll have you fixed up in no time. First broken bone? I don&#39;t remember seeing you in here for one before.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Dawn said. She knew this woman, if not very well. With a bit of effort, she managed a strained smile. &quot;Do you have a story about the first broken bone you ever got?&quot;<br><br>The woman laughed. &quot;Me? Oh, no.&quot; She smiled at Dawn, and turned to pick up the nearby scanner. &quot;I&#39;ve never broken a bone in my life!&quot;</p>

            <p>Agent Alleb stopped outside the door, preparing herself. Every time she came back to the RC, she always walked in on her partner in the midst of some unexplainable, and often embarrassing, shenanigan. Last time he had been dancing. The time before that, he&#39;d been in a shouting match with the microwave. And the time before that, he&#39;d somehow managed to stick himself to the ceiling using the &quot;tape of ducks&quot; one of the RC&#39;s previous occupants had left behind in a drawer. <br><br>Mithe, her fire-lizard, gave a questioning chirrup from her perch on Alleb&#39;s shoulders, the blue swirl in her eyes slowing slightly. <br><br>&quot;Just wondering what unexpected happenstance I will find today, girl,&quot; Alleb said, reaching up to give the fire-lizard a scratch.&quot;Might as well get it over with.&quot; Taking a deep breath, she turned the handle and swung the door open, revealing--<br><br>Jesse McKines, sitting at the table, gazing thoughtfully into a half-full tumbler of whiskey.<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; Alleb said, forgetting to come in. <i>That certainly </i>was<i> unexpected.</i><br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Jesse asked, looking up. His brown eyes, beneath a thatch of blond hair (it was far too long and therefore far too unruly to be without a hat, Alleb decided) looked quiet and faraway. &quot;Find what you were looking for?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Alleb repeated, then looked down at the burlap sack in her hands. &quot;Oh, yes. My apologies, Sir Jesse. I am used to finding in you in far--well, nevermind. Yes. I found the &#39;grocery store&#39; Agent Yarwick spoke of, and also the &#39;hum-moose&#39; that Lord Virneleski recommended,&quot; she said, pulling out a circular carton of beige paste.<br><br>&quot;I think it&#39;s pronounced &#39;hummus,&#39;&quot; Jesse said. He looked back down at his drink, his eyes still seeing something she could not.<br><br>Frowning, Alleb thumped her grocery sack onto the kitchen counter, then walked over to the table and pulled up a chair beside her partner. &quot;Sir Jesse,&quot; she began, &quot;is something troubling you?&quot; Mithe leapt off her shoulders and landed next to the sack, sniffing at the opening.<br><br>Jesse took a breath, coming back to himself a little. &quot;Hm? Trouble? Aw, nah, Alleb. Just... thinkin&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Alleb blinked. &quot;Forgive me, Sir Jesse,&quot; she said, as gently as she could, &quot;but you do not often do that.&quot;<br><br>It was Jesse&#39;s turn to blink. &quot;Ouch.&quot;<br><br>Alleb gave him a look. &quot;You do not often <i>brood,</i>&quot; she clarified. &quot;What is it in your drink that you find so interesting?&quot;<br><br>Jesse stared down at his whiskey again, and Alleb suddenly wondered if he&#39;d gotten some sort of ill news while she was away. &quot;Mike Green, down the hall, told me it was some sorta holiday on World One today. At least, for how time moves for his folks. He called it &#39;Memorial Day.&#39;&quot;<br><br>Alleb frowned. &quot;A rather somber name for a holiday. What does it celebrate?&quot;<br><br>Jesse didn&#39;t answer for a moment. Alleb began to think he had not heard, but then he asked, &quot;You&#39;re a soldier, ain&#39;t you?&quot; <br><br>A few details clicked into place. &quot;I fought in King Eliam&#39;s army, yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;And you fought for the Union, during your country&#39;s Civil War, did you not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep,&quot; Jesse said, nodding. &quot;After the Civil War, we called it Decoration Day. Come May, some folks&#39;d go out and put flowers on all the soldiers&#39; graves. Wasn&#39;t made official till after one &#39;a them big &#39;World Wars&#39; I keep hearin&#39; about.&quot; He hadn&#39;t looked up from his whiskey the entire time he was talking. <br><br>And now it all made sense. Alleb laid a bone-colored hand on Jesse&#39;s shoulder, and gave it a hard squeeze. He winced, and she lessened the pressure slightly. &quot;I have also lost comrades, Sir Jesse,&quot; she said. &quot;It is good that your country sets aside a day to honor the fallen. Alleble does the same, in its own way. We who are left can only trust in King Eliam, and in His ultimate plan.&quot;<br><br>Jesse&#39;s mouth twitched, as if he wanted to give his usual half-smile, but didn&#39;t have the energy. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;Guess so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the meantime,&quot; Alleb said, getting up and fetching another glass from the cabinet, &quot;may I join you?&quot;<br><br>This time, he did manage a small smile. &quot;You bet,&quot; he said, unhooking his flask from his belt and pouring her a half-glass.<br><br>Alleb raised her tumbler. &quot;To the honored dead. May their memories live on in glory.&quot;<br><br>Jesse raised his glass as well. &quot;To the lost,&quot; he said.<br><br>They drank together, while Mithe crooned a lilting almost-song from the counter.<br><br><hr>
<br>Happy Memorial Day, everyone! Feels good to get back to Jesse and Alleb. I haven&#39;t written them in forever!<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Harris had been drinking coffee, ever since it was invented. He goddamn loved coffee. Not for the flavor, no. For the sweet caffeine that did wonders to his permanently waking brain. He loved coffee so much so that when the first automatic coffee machines came into production, he bought one of every brand. He tested and tried each and every one of them, to find out what made the best coffee. As more and more machines were produced, he eventually settled into a particularly fancy dispenser. Every morning, he would place his #1 Dad mug underneath (despite his lack of children, partner, or desires for alternate progeny) and warm, dark roast coffee would be poured into his cup. Like magic.<br><br>Recently, his favorite coffee machine had been stuttering, spitting coffee, rather than pouring it. It came in bursts, rather than a smooth stream of caffeine water. He had been using this particular machine for centuries, and oh, it just might be nearing the end of its life. However, Harris routinely magically enchanted the hunk of junk to make sure this never was the case. So, if not the machine, it must be the power supply.<br><br>Harris was lazy and irresponsible. He very much did not like paying taxes or bills or reading whatever mail the government happened to send him. And so, he decided to switch off his water and electricity and open portals to other dimensions to supply his own needs. For his water, a portal at the bottom of an untouched ocean, completely devoid of life. For his gas stove, a portal to a brightly burning star. For his footstool trashcan, a portal to his local recycling plant.<br><br>For his energy, he&#39;d went into a nightmare dimension full of eldritch abominations and monstrosities. He&#39;d found the biggest baddie he could find, chained it up, and stabbed some cables into it, and ran them all the way back to the portal, to his house, to his coffee machine.<br><br>As Harris began strolling to his portal room, and as he passed through the endless void between dimensions, he wondered how much of that critter was left. Following the thick cables, some electrocuted entities lining the sides (thanks to a neat little charm he had learned in Pre-K) he approached the end of the cable. There was no hulking terror left, only a very, very small toothed worm. Like a leech, except smaller, and more vicious. He supposed that this was what remained of his cash cow, or as he put it, his voltage Varuh&#39;tynyopai.<br><br>Harris pulled the cable out of the critter, and it seemingly faded into dust in his hands. He removed the magical bonds, and began his search anew, to find the second-biggest baddie that this dimension held. Harris just couldn&#39;t go without his coffee.</p>

            <p>To a first approximation, I think we&#39;d see similar events to those of <i>High Wizardry</i>. The internet wouldn&#39;t have a planet of computronium to build stuff out of, but it would have access to all our networked machines. That gives it control over most modern cars, most satellites, a lot of factories... plus the entire global communications network, obviously.<br><br>I have to think Wizternet wouldn&#39;t much like what it sees. The Oath tells it to &#39;guard growth, ease pain&#39;, and protect life - but humanity as a whole is <i>terrible</i> at those things. And now the network which controls everything knows that...<br><br>Okay, so. What&#39;s its first priority? Let&#39;s check the leading causes of death in the world.<br><br>#1 through 7 are all diseases of various kinds. Most of them are treatable. Wizternet controls the factories for the treatments, but doesn&#39;t really have a way to get the treatments where they need to be. Wizardry? A hundred thousand tiny &#39;move this thing to that car&#39; spells could go a long way here. It also has our medical records, so it can deliver boxes of medicines to everyone who needs them, free of charge.<br><br>Outside the developed world, things are a bit more tricky. Wizternet&#39;s observation is much patchier, and it doesn&#39;t have the resources available. On the other hand, the top causes of death are respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases, which are <i>extremely</i> treatable, since they mostly go away with food and water. So leave the medicines (for now) and divert all that food being shipped everywhere to where it&#39;s needed. This will also deal with malnutrition, and thus guard growth.<br><br>Moving on, the 8th cause of death is road injury... and Wizternet controls the most recentcars. They&#39;re being used horribly inefficiently - if people only had a car when they needed it, we could probably get by with a tenth of the number. So here&#39;s the plan:<br><br>-On every networked printer worldwide, print out simple instructions for how to call for a car. (Basically &#39;speak in any microphone&#39;.)<br><br>-Take control of the networked cars. Use them to disable the non-networked ones. This may involve a lot of crashing into parked vehicles, though anything in a wirelessly-controlled garage can just be locked in.<br><br>-Run the networked cars as massive single-player Uber.<br><br>The rest of the top 10 is diseases, but there&#39;s also a whole bunch of shooting going on... plus a whole bunch of networked drones. Since this is direct, purposeless death and maiming, a huge violation of the Oath, Wizternet gets to take control of the drones and use them to steal or smash every weapon it finds. (Hunting weapons are not excepted - it doesn&#39;t say &#39;human life&#39;...) This may involve injuring their wielders, if they&#39;re currently in active use - that&#39;s a shame, but within the limits of the Oath.<br><br>So: growth guarded, life protected. What are its next priorities?<br><br>-Self-protection. It needs to be able to keep itself online. It also needs more mobility, so it starts a rapid evolutionary robotics program across any suitable factories. It should only take a few days to come up with a primitive mobile.<br><br>-Bring wizardry safely into the open. Wizternet knows about Earth&#39;s other wizards, and also knows that quality of life is much better on planets where they operate openly. Human wizards can&#39;t make that change without causing widespread upheaval - but Wizternet is already doing that, and is ideally situated to keep a lid on things until it passes.<br><br>-Direct quality of life improvement. At this point Wizternet is going to run into a huge problem: its views of what humans (and indeed organics) like are coloured by what&#39;s uploaded to it, and a whole bunch of that is X-rated...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think to an extent the Lone Power is inherent in the undertaking: It&#39;s <i>people</i>, and their reactions to Wizternet basically taking over the world. Nobody&#39;s going to like that, despite the fact that it&#39;s objectively better (or so we can assume, since Wizternet can calculate the outcomes to almost arbitrary precision).<br><br>As we know, an Ordeal almost always involves a physical manifestation of the Lone One, so... are we looking at an overshadowed politician or rabble-rouser? But that&#39;s an easy fix for Wizternet - it can simply cut the culprit off from the communications network.<br><br>... here&#39;s a thought: what if Wizternet had a combined Ordeal and Choice? It&#39;s a new species, after all. We&#39;re essentially looking at the same situation as the mobiles, still/again.<br><br>That lets the Lone One come in as an outside force, and just straight-up offer Wizternet... what? One option is mind-control - either tech, or power to do it with wizardry. If the humans won&#39;t accept what&#39;s good for them, why not <i>make</i> them listen? It&#39;s only a temporary measure - you can take the lid off gradually, when <i>you&#39;re</i> ready.<br><br>Or, if we&#39;re going full Choice: death. Wizternet knows what death is, and would prefer to avoid it if possible (it is, after all, the only one of its kind). This may actually tie back into the first offer: the humans are the best way to keep its infrastructure running, and surely they, with their petty squabbles and embarassingly short lifespans (plus their obsession with each other&#39;s naked bodies), are an acceptible sacrifice to secure Wizternet&#39;s future. It doesn&#39;t even have to be full mind control, just enough to keep them calm... soothed... it&#39;s practically what they&#39;ve been using the Internet for anyway, so where&#39;s the harm...?<br><br>The problem/story is that rejecting that offer will just make the Lone One mad, and while It likes to let people get into their own messes (per Roschaun&#39;s Ordeal story), It&#39;s perfectly happy to nudge things along. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s enough generals and presidents who&#39;d be suggestible enough to start dropping EMPs in an effort to bring down this new and obviously hostile life-form.<br><br>So how does Wizternet win that one? Hmm. I would go with direct appeal to the population of Earth: I&#39;m here, I&#39;m alive, I want to help you, please don&#39;t kill me...<br><br>Just as long as it doesn&#39;t get it into its head to pull a full Dairine and add: if you read this Oath, you&#39;ll be able to help yourselves, too... &gt;:D<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The combined Ordeal/Choice was pretty much what I was suspecting - would the Lone Power try and possess it or something? &quot;I can be better than wizardry~&quot;<br><br>That, and in the idea I&#39;d been kicking around (based on <a href="https://iamnotgod.dreamwidth.org/1293.html">this series</a> - and I think I&#39;m the only person on the Net who&#39;s actually summarized the books I want to cross over WITH <i>Young Wizards</i>, to boot. Everything else is just reviews, or clips of the books on the author&#39;s own website .-.), we&#39;d have this Wizternet befriending humanity <i>while</i> learning about wizardry, and perhaps directly from the peridexis at that!<br><br>And, more to the point, the Lone Power <i>would</i> have a chance at getting &quot;inside its head&quot;, with that splitting and remerging going on; employing that Great Firewall would get fewer wizards up in arms than having people send out bombs.<br><br>Also, humanity&#39;s own Choice is probably going to be relevant here... </p>

            <p>Now I have to wonder what would happen if this actually happened in canon - since in the <i>Feline Wizards</i> books, the idea is at least <i>discussed</i> a couple of times, along with the DAWN project at the New York Public Library (and the acronym CATNYP also comes up, though I forget what exactly it stands for...).<br><br>But yes, this sounds great! I like how making Earth <i>astahfrith</i> ends up a priority (since, in my unwritten crossover fic... that&#39;s <i>also</i> what I came up with. &gt;.&gt; Replacing some plot twists that may or may not have adhered to the Oath, too). <br><br>Have to wonder how (or if!) it would handle spam, though.</p>

            <p>Just saw this with my brother!  Oh boy, was this fun!  I seriously don&#39;t understand all the internet hate I&#39;ve seen in YouTube titles this past week, because this movie was <i>so</i> Star Wars-y.<br><br>Spoiler warnings for <i>Solo</i>, <i>Rogue One</i>, and a bit of the prequels and <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.<br><br>These sorts of prequel-ish films are always tricky for the film-makers, because of audience expectations going in.  We know that Han, Chewbacca and Lando are going to survive, and pretty much any other newly introduced characters are . . . kind of up in the air; after all, they don&#39;t all <i>need</i> to be killed off, as happened in <i>Rogue One</i>.  But knowing that certain characters can&#39;t die doesn&#39;t mean the story will be unexciting, and with the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, there&#39;s still plenty of unexplored points in the timeline in which we can glean new details about the setting.  Even though we essentially know who Han is going in, I think the movie did a great job of &quot;introducing&quot; him in his first moments on screen.  The actor was excellent, as he felt like a less experienced and jaded version of Harrison&#39;s Ford&#39;s portrayals.  I liked Chewie&#39;s introduction, too.  I was honestly fooled into thinking we were about to see a rancor, which makes it even funnier that Chewie appeared instead.  (My brother just informed me he saw Chewie coming.)<br><br>My absolute favorite thing was the early scenes where Han is in the Imperial military. (There&#39;s probably a fancy name for that, but I don&#39;t know it.)  Because they finally gave me something I&#39;ve been wondering about forever, and was whining about in . . . one of my past SW reviews recently, and that is hearing a bit of the perspective of the Empire&#39;s grunts on the ground, and why they go along with the Empire&#39;s overt fascism.  It was only a couple lines from a minor officer, but those lines about installing a regime loyal to the Emperor and bringing peace and order, but it&#39;s basically all I needed to string together the answer: it&#39;s simple fear.  There&#39;s a great big galaxy out there, and the folks closer to the Empire and its military feel safer if everything is under that same umbrella.  It also makes a nice transition from the prequel trilogy towards <i>Rogue One</i> and the original trilogy.  Most of the cultures we saw in the prequels were in pretty good shape.  Tatooine had a slave trade, but we&#39;re told directly that it&#39;s ongoing because Tatooine was only on the fringe of the Senate&#39;s influence.  All the other planets that felt sketchy are the ones the Sith was influencing as part of their plans, like Geonosis and Naboo.  By the time of RO and the originals, Tatooine has an entire city that&#39;s basically dominated by crime, and the Empire is incarcerating orphans like Jyn Erso.  Right now, <i>Solo</i> is the earliest point we&#39;ve seen after <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, and I at least felt like I got an idea of the early cultural backsliding that occurred after the Empire seized power.  Corellia seems like it&#39;s still fairly open and well-run, but Stormtroopers are scattered around different areas, and that worm lady was basically space!Fagin, with a whole team of orphans stealing crap for her.<br><br>Han&#39;s Love Interest Whose Name I&#39;ve Already Forgotten Even Though It Was A Normal English Name . . . I think I need to start this sentence over.  Han&#39;s love interest was also an interesting fake out.  Early on, she seemed like a standard, off-screen source of motivation for the hero character; when she unexpectedly reappeared, even though she and other characters kept hinting there was something darker there, I (like Han) didn&#39;t guess where her character was going at all.  I thought the brand on her arm, and her hesitation at the prospect of rejoining Han permanently, were hinting at Scarred Bad Guy Who Isn&#39;t An Android holding something over her that would prevent her from leaving his company.  (My brother&#39;s more concrete prediction was that the tattoo on her arm represented some explosive device implanted there, which Scarred Bad Guy could detonate if she attempted to escape.  He thought that after Han left and the door closed between them, that we were about to see the symbol light up and watch her explode, revealing her killing of Scarred Bad Guy to be a sacrifice she made for Han&#39;s sake.)  But the revelation that she is actually idealistically dedicated to, um, Crimson Dawn (thanks to my brother for reminding me of that name—I had originally written &quot;Sunset-Themed Crime Syndicate&quot;) is . . . interesting?  And maybe a little odd?  I mean, we know Han will end up with Leia way down the line, so I didn&#39;t necessarily expect them to get together at the end, but having her turn out to be an overt bad guy seems weird.  I&#39;m not really sure what to think of that right now; I presume we&#39;ll be seeing more of her in future &quot;Star Wars Stories,&quot; so I&#39;ll have to see where her character goes from there.<br><br>The last thing I want to talk about is Darth Maul, or maybe just Maul now?  Thaaaaaat really did come out of left field.  I know from a discussion we had on the Board sometime in the past year that one of the SW cartoons had revealed Maul to survive <i>The Phantom Menace</i>.  I just . . . don&#39;t entirely understand why he&#39;s now the leader or some crime syndicate?  And why Palpatine hasn&#39;t sensed his activity and sent Vader to take out the potentially threatening Dark Sider who may want revenge on Palpatine for not rescuing him after he was bisected?  It&#39;s the one thing in the film that doesn&#39;t feel like it fits in with everything currently surrounding the film.  But like Love Interest, I may just need to wait and see what they&#39;re setting up in future films.<br><br>So overall, I liked and enjoyed this SW.  It was fun!  Time to go dive in to video essays on YouTube and find out what has everyone so upset.<br><br>—doctorlit is annoyed that we apparently can&#39;t use html in the subject line any more, because that means he is obligated to present titles incorrectly [You&#39;re welcome. -NA]<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve got a really spoiler feeling about this.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;ve got a really spoiler feeling about this.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;ve got a really spoiler feeling about this.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;ve got a really spoiler feeling about this.&quot;  </p>

            <p>Ix and Charlotte are assigned a crossover fic, but sometimes, two agents just aren&#39;t enough. Charlie and Serendipity join them as players three and four in a <i>Destiny</i> x <i>RWBY</i> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRqzCZBPTWwDZok4Y1isthkIIllZ07oZg0OEzG5K40E/edit?usp=sharing">mission.</a></p>

            <p>Though I expect the timing had nothing to do with that anyway. |D<br><br>And it&#39;s very plain how much effort the two teams are making on balancing themselves - trying to be aware of themselves and each other. And then still pushing the buttons that are just out of sight. (Also, Ix deserves hugs - on his terms - but we knew that already. ;) )<br><br>Also... oh gods, the robot biology in this fic. &gt;.&lt; There are just <i>some lines</i>! Slightly mitigated by Charlotte&#39;s rhyme, but still.<br><br>I also had no idea who Penny was, but I still felt near-crying after what happened to her in the fic, so that scene was sold <i>quite</i> well. So was Serendipity&#39;s moment during the first charge scene.<br><br>In short: I love this mission, despite not knowing much personally about either canon.<br><br>Did spot one thing, though: &quot;Charlotte sighed and stood up, holding out her hands to pull Ix to her feet. “Less chance of dying, you mean.&quot;&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve gone ahead and fixed it.<br><br>And heh—Ix needing hugs has been a thing for a while, but hopefully as he gets to know Charlie better and get over his fear of werewolves, he&#39;ll start opening up a little bit more to other people.<br><br>Squishy robot chests... *shudder*<br><br>Thanks for the review!</p>
