            <p>(I&#39;m not one to break a theme, after all. ^_~)<br><br>We should be able to come, but will have to bring the kids along. If the Gathering takes place at a museum-y-type-place, Kaitlyn has offered to split off with them once they get too antsy. So... how does the Science Museum sound? It&#39;s free, it&#39;s easy to access (right next to the Natural History Museum), and it&#39;s the one we were going to do last time if we had time, but didn&#39;t.<br><br>Also, y&#39;know... science.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That&#39;s when the Science Museum opens, so it makes sense. The queue doesn&#39;t get too long there, so just meeting outside the front door seems plausible; I think we mostly recognise each other by now.<br><br>There&#39;s the usual flexibility in when to end the Gathering; we&#39;ll probably have to duck out early once the kids get cranky, but anyone who needs to go can go when they need to (if that makes sense).<br><br>On past evidence, we&#39;ll probably spend the whole day in the Science Museum; it has a range of options for buying food, from burgers to salads to milkshakes, plus a couple of nice &#39;picnic areas&#39;. There are various things you can pay to access (a practical science area called the Wonderlab, an IMAX screen running space shows, I think there&#39;s a flight simulator too), but it seems unlikely we would.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hello, I&#39;m Shade, and I&#39;ve decided I should introduce myself before losing myself within TOS and the mission stories. I generally lurk in FanFiction.net, but have dipped myself within AO3. My fandoms are; Harry Potter, Merlin (Tv Series) LOTR (Do you accept abbreviations?) Skulduggery Pleasant, Fate/Stay Night, Percy Jackson and Avengers. I’m a student in Australia but I have American roots, which makes for a horrible accent.<br> I love games, and I’m currently hooked on For Honor and the Witcher 3. I got here from browsing fanfiction.net and saw a reference a ‘Tenth Walker’ and ‘Mary Sue’. One thing led to another and now I’m here.<br>On a side note, please don’t murder me.<br>(Please note Australian English is different from American and British English)<br></p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>Since you&#39;ve already got plans to read the Original Series, all I really have left to do is point you at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>. That and TOS are pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>(I&#39;m an American student in London right now, so I get a lot of side-eyes for my accent, too.

            <p>Huh. I&#39;ll keep my eyes open for that.<br><br>In the meantime, if you have Netflix, check out <i>The Dragon Prince</i>! It&#39;s by the same people, and has a lot of the same charm as A:TLA with fun characters and an interesting new fantasy world. The animation style is a little strange—I think my friend told me it&#39;s 2D painting skinned over 3D frames? It&#39;s pretty, though a bit jerky. It&#39;s a little distracting at first, but I got used to it. Only one season at present, alas. I look forward to the next one.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Very funny!  I could pretty much tell from the lead-up that <i>something</i> was going to happen, but I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be so dramatic.  I had forgotten Aiden had firebender heritage!  I like Aiden&#39;s characterization in general, very realistically &quot;little kid&quot;-esque.  But his reactions to discovering fire and playing around with it to experiment were superb.  I like how Fellrazer goes from seeing Aiden as a source of cuddles to an actual playmate after the firebending begins, too.<br><br>I loved Gall&#39;s reaction, too.  She&#39;s so used to brute-forcing her way through problems, but here, she met a situation that couldn&#39;t be solved through punching, and I could read in her dialogue and behavior how exhausting the situation became for her.<br><br>Too bad Aiden didn&#39;t get to see <i>Dumbo</i>, though.  He would have liked the scene at the end.  With all the fire.<br><br>—doctorlit, worrying about the books in RC 555 now</p>

            <p>To clear things up, I have learned that Huinesoron is pronounced &quot;HWEEN-ay-SORE-on.&quot;<br><br>And about me...<br><br>1. My username is made up of English words, so I’m pretty sure you’d know how to pronounce it. And “Twistey” is pronounced how it’s spelled, or at least how the misspelling “Twisty” is spelled.<br>2. I’m a pasty, skinny white girl, 5’7” and a half, with brown hair about chin length and green eyes with glasses. This time of year, you can usually find me wearing a T-shirt and jeans or comfy pants, with a watch on my left wrist, a bracelet on my right, and a navy blue hooded jacket over it all, but my “official” outfit with regards to how I draw myself consists of a black shirt with a minimalist-style luna moth on it, jeans, tennis shoes, and a grey jacket over it all. You can also put me in a black floor-length robe with thin red and gold trim on the sleeves (in that order from the ends), coupled with a long red preacher-scarf-thing (with some occult symbol on the ends) and a talisman with a large red jewel in the center. This odd, cultist-y ensemble is for reasons I shall explain further in point 3.<br>3. I’m the PPC’s resident wild card, and I always have been. I found the PPC by chance, I joined on an impulse without any prior research whatsoever, and I’ve been off-and-on falling down the metaphorical stairs and having to deal with the consequences ever since. As such, a lot of the jokes I make about myself on the Board involve me doing things that either are outright stupid or leave everyone scratching their heads. Also, with regards to the virtual persona I’ve created on the Board, thanks to the power of badfic, I’m mostly human but partially a decoy (from Wolfenstein 3D - ask me if you want to know more about them, including their canonical name). So you can make fire jokes, you can make mannequin/puppet jokes, you can make occult jokes, and you can make &quot;unable to open doors&quot; jokes. Finally, I also love anything glowy and sci-fi, or that otherwise looks cool, and as I was raised on music, I love putting music in the background of things.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>If you haven&#39;t played Fall of Cybertron, not only is it an excellent Transformers game, it&#39;s a great game in general. Reason I bring it up is because it&#39;s a third-person shooter where at the push of a button you can swap perspective from over the left shoulder to over the right, or back again, allowing you to make creative use as cover while at the same time technically allowing all the characters to be left-handed in the game&#39;s continuity.  (Ugh, whyyyy did they have to shoehorn Bayformers into the sequel rather than keep going with the Aligned continuity...&gt;()</p>

I find interesting things in various colors and patterns in resale stores. Tend to favor blues and reds, but I can go for just about any color except yellow, bright orange, or bright/too-yellow green, since they can make my skin look greenish or jaundiced. Usually pants, often grey or black, but sometimes a long skirt; my usuals are khaki, dark olive green, and blue.<br><br>On my left hand, a white-gold engagement ring with a white- and rose-gold wedding ring (<a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Neshomeh/media/Hand%20-%20Lf1.jpg.html">visible here</a>). On my left wrist, a sterling silver cuff bracelet inscribed with &quot;not all who wander are lost.&quot; (Serious Tolkien buffs will note the missing word &quot;those&quot; between &quot;all&quot; and &quot;who.&quot;) I also often wear a necklace.

            <p>1) Hellga is pronounced Anna.  Yeah.  Though back in the last millennium when internet was young and I didn&#39;t use my real name anywhere online, it was HELL-gah.<br><br>2) Tall (5&#39;10&quot;), reasonably in-shape woman with eggplant-colored shoulder-length hair (going gray in my 30s kind of sucks, but if I have to color it, I might as well color it something fun) and brown eyes behind pink-rimmed glasses. <br><br>3)  Most people think I am kind and friendly when they look at me.  This is merely part of my job.  I am actually very evil (but too lazy to actually do anything evil... other than increasing entropy of the universe, of course).  Oh, and I speak English with an accent that I always ask people to guess, if they do ask me where I am from. :) </p>

            <p>I never wear all black unless I am heading to a funeral.  It&#39;s my pet peeve with New Yorkers - prevalence of black on the streets.  I even bought a hot pink coat to wear in the winter when I head into the city, because I felt my red one was not enough to cut through all the dullness around me.  I prefer bright, happy colors (except no yellow/orange, they make me look like a wax figure) and bold patterns.  And I wear mostly dresses (I own over 70 of them, in different cuts, colors and patterns). </p>

Not more than anyone else I&#39;ve ever met or anything, but...), and I&#39;m typically dressed in whatever came out of my wardrobe first, in the kind of total disregard for fashion that can only exist out of habit, with a general messiness and disorder around me to match.

            <p>I hate multi-player games, I never play them.  And I don&#39;t play much now anyway, I just don&#39;t have time - but sometimes it&#39;s nice to spend an hour or two with an old favorite.  The best old game is still XCOM:TFTD and even if graphics are outdated, game is the best.   I liked the Might and Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic series though I haven&#39;t played any that were released after 2001 or so - I like M&amp;M 7 and 8, and HMM3 - I loved HMM2 but I grew to love HMM3 more.  And I always will have a soft spot for Warlords which I also haven&#39;t played in probably 25 years - it had fully customizable units, something I don&#39;t recall in any other games.  My best friend and I had a ball coming up with all kinds of them...  I also have a soft spot for Barbarian - that&#39;s a true oldie, from the 80s, but when my parents took me to work they would park me at a computer with Barbarian, Digger and Tetris on it and it was fun.  Then the Lost Vikings came out sometime fairly soon after that, too... <br><br>Now I played the old Warcraft 1 and 2, but never any of the new versions - I never really got into them anyway, I played them mainly because my brother did. And Dungeon Keeper, and Allods, and Diablo 1 and 2 and other games that I can&#39;t remember anymore, but the MM/HMM were the ones I played the most.</p>

            <p>I remember that HoMM3 felt weird when I first got it because I spent countless hours playing HoMM2 for a couple years, but I ended up liking it more and now I think it is definitely the better game.  Though the version on GOG is not the same as the original 1998 (?) version, they made Castle less, ahem, Sue-ish, otherwise it was way easier to win playing that city vs. any other.  It still is, though.<br><br>I never played the original XUD, only TFtD.  I remember that I kept getting stuck, until my Dad got the saved game from one of his colleagues, and from his saved point mid-game I was able to play to completion.  When I replayed it as an adult some 10-15 years later I was able to actually win it on my own start to finish (though I did read some tips on development).  The trick is to choose the right development strategy and to ruthlessly dismiss any recruits who are subpar. </p>

            <p>How to pronounce &quot;Huinesoron&quot;: learn Elvish.<br><br>1. I doubt anyone is confused by mine, but it&#39;s &quot;lit&quot; as in &quot;literature,&quot; not pronounced like &quot;light.&quot;  For the record, I&#39;ve used this name since long before &quot;lit&quot; became internet vernacular in the last couple of years.<br><br>2. 5&#39;7&quot;.  Brown hair that is officially buzz cut low, but I let it grow out to roughly bowl cut length before I buzz it again, because it&#39;s a question of convenience (not spending time on my hair) rather than appearance.  Um, white boy, thirty-two years old.  Above-average muscular arms and legs, but shapeless blobby torso.  Eyes that look blue or greenish depending on what clothes colors I&#39;m wearing.  Scar on white cheek from a toddler-era surgery.  Always clean-shaven when in public.  Need thick-framed glasses for distance vision.  Tiny teenager hands with short fingers.  Usually wear cargo shorts and collared shirts.  Prefer flip-flops over tennis shoes, but open-toed shoes aren&#39;t allowed at work.  Forego socks early in morning so they don&#39;t get wet spraying down exhibit rooms.  Terrible at describing appearances.<br><br>3.  Not really sure what&#39;s being looked for here?  I feel a desperate need for stories, to the point where I pretty much call consuming fiction &quot;feeding&quot; in my mind any more.  Don&#39;t like people, and feel U.S. society teaches people too much to obsess over feeling fun and happy all the time, when our time is best spent taking care of the planet so our species can endure for forever.  Obsessed with the idea that only things that last forever matter, and put as much of my time as possible into workaholism because the work I put into the world is the only part of me that will last forever.  Also secretly desperate to become immortal somehow.  Incapable of sitting still and just relaxing/thinking, always need some form of &quot;assignment&quot; to occupy my brain.<br><br>—doctorlit doesn&#39;t know where to go from here</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve already made some PPC &quot;memes&quot; via Walfas. Three of them included how various Boarders are perceived by badficcers and by newbies versus how they actually are, one of them was a random Huinesoron quote in visual form, and one of them was about the 2017 Badfic Games. Since I now have to download Walfas in order to use it, I&#39;m going to be using other programs instead, but PPC memes shall be in order.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

<li>My username isn&#39;t pronounced weirdly, so I&#39;ll say this instead: if it&#39;s too clunky &quot;Moons&quot; tends to be the easiest part to make nicknames out of.<br>2. Teenage girl. Average height, very skinny, pale-ish. Shoulderblade-length wavy (and usually pretty messy) copper hair. Bangs. Green eyes, glasses. I have a sharpie tattoo on the inside of my left wrist (a semicolon with the name TAYA written under it) and make an active effort to never cover it unless it&#39;s cold enough to be wearing gloves. I usually wear a chaplet of blue glass beads with a Celtic knot pendant at the back, and a short beaded strand finished with a wings pendant hanging from that.

Whenever someone uses &quot;god&quot; as part of an exclamation, I&#39;m more likely than not to respond with &quot;yeah, but which god?&quot; I&#39;m very picky about music and get kind of defensive about my tastes in it.

            <p>When I tried for permission, hs asked me for an extra piece of writing. Here it is:<br><br>Rasputin Gibbs would have felt a lot better about life if he had known where he was, but the featureless corridors of the PPC headquarters seemed intent on getting him lost. On the plus side, Colonel Bradbury had a seemingly endless supply of anecdotes, so what could have been total boredom had turned into a fairly educational delve into his partner’s psyche.<br><br>“So I had about half a minute to create an explanation for the non-existence of the Bureau of Military Acupuncture, and all I could get out of my mouth was ‘503.’ The Policía Militar thug paused in confusion, and this gave me enough time to turn my random utterance into something I could use. So I said I wanted a signed 503 and an initialed 22b or I would court martial the poor schmuck. Now, that was in no way within my power, but I figured that anyone who got sent to deal with stuff this dumb wouldn’t know that.”<br><br>At this point Gibbs interrupted him: “Wait, so you just made up a branch of Sanitary and Health Command?”<br><br>Bradbury didn’t answer, instead holding up a closed fist in the universal gesture for “stop.” He then turned and whispered to Gibbs: “There’s someone up ahead. I think we have a problem.”<br><br>“I see someone,” said Gibbs, “but not the problem.”<br><br>Gibbs looked again at the agent approaching them, just to check, but from his limited experience she seemed to be a standard PPC agent: a frazzled-looking human female with glasses.<br><br>Bradbury’s voice took on a more urgent tone, his mind buzzing with the application of inapplicable life experience. “We’re about to have authority abused at us.”<br><br>Gibbs was about to reply when the human coming towards them noticed the crate Bradbury held, and asked with mild interest: “Running errands?”<br><br>Bradbury knew how this would go. In his hind-brain this was 2022, he was a Subteniente being hassled by someone more seasoned, and it wouldn’t end well. The important thing was to confuse the issue.<br><br>This line of non-thought led to his next utterance: “Drain cleaner.”<br><br>The agent looked at him for a moment, one eyebrow raised: “Then why do they have hand-written labels saying: ‘Colonel Bradbury’s Old White Lightning’?”<br><br>Bradbury didn’t even blink. “I’m smuggling it. For the good of society. I’m thwarting the tyrannical excise-man and bringing cheap goods to those who need them.”<br><br>The agent’s mild curiosity had turned into severe confusion. “You do realize no government has jurisdiction in HQ, right? There’s no one who can tax goods.”<br><br>Bradbury took this curve-ball and, to mix a metaphor, ran with it. “Exactly. I can buy and sell anything here totally duty-free. Why do impede me in my quest? Do you hate the poor? Are you some kind of Communist? Are you some kind of Capitalist?! DO YOU WANT THE POOR TO HAVE MOLDY PLUMBING?!”<br><br>Gibbs wondered what it was like to be an awkward twenty-something confronted by an old guy shouting for no reason. It was all he could do not to explode into a pile of laughter, or whatever it was humans said.<br><br>Bradbury turned and whispered to Gibbs, total calm in his voice: “On my count, run. One. Two. Three. Now.”<br><br>Bradbury dropped the box and ran headlong down the corridor. Gibbs went with the flow, but managed to get out an incongruously cheerful “Bast Chauble!” before he left the bewildered young agent’s hearing range.<br><br>After they had gotten themselves even more thoroughly lost, Gibbs turned to Bradbury: “So, in the end, how did that whole Military Acupuncture thing play out?”<br><br>Bradbury thought about this.<br><br>“Upon reflection, it doesn&#39;t seem that important.”</p>

            <p>I probably should&#39;ve read the other parts of your Permission attempt before I read this one, as this left me just a tad bit confused (not too much, though).

            <p><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=318261;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">This</a> was the post in which I asked for an additional writing sample, for reference.<br><br>I&#39;m going to lead with this: <b>Permission granted</b>. This piece addresses most of my concerns, so based on my previous post, I&#39;m happy to sign off on this. Good job!<br><br>The reason for that &#39;most&#39; is the characters themselves. I can see you&#39;ve tried to work in both &#39;Gibbs is a lizard&#39; and &#39;Bradbury is Argentine&#39;, but the way you&#39;ve done it is fairly superficial. I can demonstrate this in five words:<br><br><i>Colonel Bradbury’s Old White Lightning</i><br><br>-Why &#39;Colonel&#39;? You use the Spanish <i>Policía Militar</i> and <i>Subteniente</i>, but then return to English for the booze.<br><br>-Why &#39;Bradbury&#39;? He&#39;s Argentine! <a href="https://surnames.behindthename.com/top/lists/argentina/2006">Here&#39;s</a> a list of common surnames in Argentina, actually around the time Bradbury was born. Note the lack of stereotypically English names. Now, he could be a son of immigrants - but then why is he named Caleb? <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/0_popular-baby-names-from-around-the-world_1429034.bc#articlesection2">Here&#39;s another short list</a>.<br><br>-Why &#39;Old White Lightning&#39;? That&#39;s a US English term for illicit booze (ie, moonshine). What&#39;s the Argentine term? That was an excellent place to show off his heritage, but you chose(?) to stick with an American term instead. <br><br>My point isn&#39;t so much that Caleb Bradbury can&#39;t be from Argentina, but that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any reason to think he <i>is</i>. Yes, he uses a few Spanish terms. But he&#39;s still blatantly a Victorian English pip-pip-chocks-away-chap. I don&#39;t understand why you would assign him a really interesting backstory, and then essentially ignore it.<br><br>(For the record, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshine_by_country">Wikipedia doesn&#39;t list Argentina&#39;s</a> variant of moonshine, but points me at Peruvian <i>pisco</i>, or Ecuadorian <i>puro</i>, <i>trago</i>, <i>puntas</i> or <i>fuerte</i>. That took me about two minutes to figure out.)<br><br>Gibbs is much the same. He&#39;s a giant lizard whose people run the world! Other than &#39;two of your huuu-man centuries&#39;-type talk, there&#39;s nothing to showcase that at all. I can think of half a dozen ways to play off it with the story Bradbury tells at the beginning (his people are so hierarchical that lying like Bradbury did would be high treason! Or they&#39;re so used to lying to the humans that he just assumes this is normal! Or he doesn&#39;t know what a &#39;caught marshall&#39; even is! Or he doesn&#39;t Get lying because his race can read emotions and sense dishonesty! Or he just figures this is how departments get created in human militaries! Or... etc etc etc); instead, he reacts like anyone else.<br><br>Which is fine sometimes; no story can hold up to &#39;Agent Qaarg, who was an alien, alienned alienishly up to his partner and said, in Alienese, &quot;Hi; I&#39;m an alien.&quot;&#39;, but if you don&#39;t give us <i>anything</i> to differentiate him... why make him a lizard at all?<br><br>So that&#39;s my concern, and the thing I think you should look into. But Permission Granted, woot woot, on you go. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>by Stephen King.  Yay, a bonus <i>Dark Tower</i> novel!  While the <i>Dark Tower</i> series as a whole is very cool, there were definitely a lot of things that never got answered in the original seven novels.  So an extra installment in between novels four and five was very welcome!  Spoilers follow for <i>The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass</i> and <i>The Wind Through the Keyhole</i>.<br><br>One unfortunate thing about putting all the novels in order is that TWTtK comes immediately after the one that was already a novel-length flashback to Roland’s youth, which means there’s now a huge section right in the middle of the series where the present-day action barely moves forward, while Roland is telling stories to his friends.  Buuuuuuut I don’t totally mind, because we get some more world-building for two separate periods of Mid-World’s history!<br><br>First, the old in-universe legend of Tim and the worst stepfather ever.  This is the only piece of TDT literature that confirms the connections to Arthurian legend in Mid-World’s past, rather than mentions of “Arthur Eld.”  The name “Maerlyn” had been used in the original novels as a possible alternate name for the good old Man in Black, the most recurring Stephen King villain there is.  I feel dumb now, because I never understood that “Maerlyn” was supposed to be a corrupted version of “Merlin.”  But having Merlin himself appear on page does a lot to make Mid-World’s past feel less like an unknowable legend that everyone alive was just guessing at, and more like the actual magical history the setting deserved to have.  (Though it’s still awkwardly and confusingly mixed between real Earth history and its own fantasy elements.)  We also get a dragon!  I didn’t know Mid-World had dragons, and it’s kind of cool that they’re intelligent enough to let a little kid go after he apologizes profusely for disturbing her, rather than just being aggressive, mindless predators.  I’m looking forward to reading <i>The Eyes of the Dragon</i> now, as I’ve heard that the Man in Black appears there too, which makes me wonder if it’s actually set in Mid-World.<br><br>As for the actual story-within-a-flashback, eh.  I mean, it’s well set-up and all as a story, but as someone from a step-family, I’m never a fan of the old Cinderella-style cliché of “the step-family is evil.”  I mean, I guess in fairness, Big Kells starts out evil first and only becomes step-father later . . . eh, doesn’t really help for me.  Oh, and the appearance of the Man in Black in the story is interesting, because that means Roland heard fairy tales of his own future arch-nemesis when he was tiny, though admittedly, nothing in TWTtK indicates that Roland actually recognizes the character as such.<br><br>One interesting note is that when one character describes the ability billy-bumblers have to sense dangerous storms in advance, she called it their “bright.”  This sounds a lot like the way characters are said to have a “shine” when they have the Shining.  I’m not sure this is a connection King was trying to make, though, because up until now, only human characters have shined, and I don’t understand how an entire species of animal could have the Shining that way.  But who knows?<br><br>Moving on to the flashback itself, it really ties up the emotional fallout we never got to see after the flashback in WaG, when Roland was tricked into shooting his mother.  We knew Roland felt conflicted about it, due to his love for his mother, but also the betrayal he felt in her cheating on his father.  But we never knew his father’s reaction, so it was nice getting more of Steven’s personality.  We also get to see more of Mid-World’s slow descent into anarchy and rebellion against Steven’s rule, and even though our first-person protagonist is the king’s son, it’s actually pretty easy to sympathize with the lower class members of the society.  With every aspect of Mid-World running down year by year, from the technological knowledge to the soil to time itself, survival becomes harder and harder, and Gilead’s resources for taking care of everyone and enforcing peace farther out from the capitol are clearly beginning to fail.  (I mean, Roland’s inner monologue realizes that the mine workers are essentially paid slaves, and proceeds to do nothing about it!)  I wonder if Roland himself ever understood that, or if he still feels bitter about the overthrow of his father?<br><br>The skin-man is a seriously scary monster.  Obviously based on skin-walkers of Navajo legend, it evokes all the terror of that legend, and mixes in the usual Dark Tower technology through the fact that the creature was created when a man crawled into a crack in the mine and came in contact with technology from either our era of Earth, or from our future.  It adds to the hints that Mid-World may have been an Earth itself at some point in the past, with both Earth tech and Earth legends still haunting little nooks and crannies in the world.  I’m curious if the green light pouring out of the crack in the ground where the miner was transformed into a skin-man is supposed to be a hint at the green crystal ball, though I’m not sure we learned enough about it in the first novel to say for sure.  Either way, the variety of animals the skin-man transforms into in this novel is pretty cool, especially the final one.<br><br>—doctorlit wonders if we’ll ever get more info on Roland’s backstory</p>

            <p>I agree with all of this, although I didn&#39;t read this one till after I finished  the rest of the series. So most of what I enjoyed were the moments we got to share with the Ka-Tet again.  I love the development they share throughout the whole series--they really feel like a family and they seem so *real* and natural.  I found myself sliding back into the atmosphere of the setting as if I walked with them.  Also, did you read Hearts in Atlantis? I was pleasantly surprised to find a short Roland story mixed in with the others! Namely, Little Sisters of Eularia. (sp.?)<br>Also. I wonder if Tim&#39;s quote, &quot;GET ME OFF THIS [CENSORED] ISLAND&quot; was in the version Roland&#39;s mother told him as a child...<br>Anyhow. Glad to see more Boarders have made the pilgrimage to the Tower!</p>

It&#39;s a role-play from after Agent Halley got stranded in Mid-World for a while, which may or may not have existed as a published story at some point; we&#39;ll never know for sure, since the Bad Role-play Department has vanished from the internet.

            <p>I think what we were seeing in Wind Through the Keyhole was, in between the introduction of the story and Roland&#39;s own memories, the actual original events the story was based off of, implying that there really was a Tim Stoutheart, and the bits about him were the original events, whereas Roland was actually telling a different version, do ya kennit?

            <p>Although while present-day Roland would definitely make the connection, I&#39;m not sure the teenage Roland during the skin-man mission would have realized?
