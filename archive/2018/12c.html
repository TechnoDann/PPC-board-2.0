            <p>I&#39;m probably a member of too many fandoms if I have to be honest. I can&#39;t really say I have a favorite fic, but I have to say that I enjoy the &#39;what if&#39; fics the most.

            <p>Let me think for a second about fandoms... I belong to the Rick Riodan fandom, Harry Potter (of course), David Eddings, the Mistborn trilogy (haven&#39;t picked up some of the more recent books from that series, but loved the first three), Dragonriders of Pern, kinda sorta the Wheel of Time, How to Train Your Dragon (started reading the books when I was younger, enjoyed the movies, although they could be closer to the book Canon,) and a bunch more. <br><br>Thank you for the feather, and I&#39;m sure that the Spikes will come in handy.

            <p>As for bleepolate...it&#39;s a portmanteau of bleep+chocolate. There are probably other pronunciations, but I tend to go with &quot;BLEEP-oh-let&quot;.

            <p>It kind of went a little off-topic. I thought I&#39;d give Tiger just one triumph, seeing as it is Christmas.<br><br>The drawing room was filled with people, all smiling and drinking except Tiger, who was crouched in a corner. He didn’t much feel like celebrating. He never did.<br><br>The door swung open and a fat, red-faced man in a white apron entered, holding a covered dish, entered.<br><br>“Excuse me,” he said loudly, and everyone turned to look at him. “There’s… err… been a bit of a problem with the turkey.” He whipped the cover aside to reveal a charred black turkey.<br><br>Tiger expected his father to immediately take charge and start asking questions, but nothing happened. Instead, everyone started talking at once.<br><br>“When did this happen?”<br><br>“How did that turkey get burnt?”<br><br>“Who did it?”<br><br>Tiger said nothing. He was thinking. It seemed very weird. It was too half-hearted, too small. No-one here would want to do something like that. Unless…<br><br>“It’s a distraction!” he said triumphantly, but no-one heard him. The room was rapidly dissolving into chaos. Fingers were being pointed, people were being blamed, everyone was trying to test the turkey with different kinds of magic…<br><br>Where had all this come from? Where was the ordered, measured, thoughtful reaction that usually met any problem, however small?<br><br>Then Tiger realised.<br><br>His father wasn’t there.<br><br>He quickly cast an amplification charm on himself and then yelled “SHUT UP!” <br><br>Everyone turned to stare at him. That had come out a lot louder than he had intended. He took a deep breath and then said calmly, “My father isn’t here.”<br><br>Instantly the chaos returned, except even more chaotic than before. No-one knew what to do any more. There was no clear leader to organise and plan things.<br><br>From out of the mass of voices, one emerged loudly: Holly’s.<br><br>“Tiger!” she was saying. “What have you done?” She marched up to him, deliberately invading his personal space.<br><br>Tiger shot her a look but didn’t step backwards. “Nothing,” he said, trying to keep his voice level.<br><br>“You liar! You’re the one responsible for this! You’re the only one who has a motive – “<br><br>“Holly,” said Tiger, “Are you even more of an idiot than I already knew you were? Everyone here has a motive, what we need to consider is opportunity. Who could have done this?”<br><br>“You!” Holly screamed. “You did it, you liar!”<br><br>“Do you have any actual proof?” he asked, mind whirling. People here distrusted him, and quite a lot wanted him gone. If he couldn’t do something fast, he might be in danger. He needed to figure out who had really done it. <br><br>“I heard you muttering to yourself! I saw the notebook with the plan in it!”<br><br>“Blatant lies,” said Tiger. Who could have made Francis Moon vanish? Surely no-one could. It was completely and utterly impossible. Tiger couldn’t even imagine how to go about it without being caught within seconds.<br><br>“I didn’t do it, Holly,” he said, struggling not to panic and keeping his voice carefully level. “I’m fifteen. There is no possible way I could have done this.”<br><br>“Then who did?” challenged Holly boldly. Everyone had now turned to look at the siblings. Tiger knew he was trapped. He had seconds to come up with the answer.<br><br>In a flash, it hit him. It was obvious. <br><br>“He did,” said Tiger. <br><br>The door swung open. “Well done, Tiger,” said Francis Moon. “Yes, I did it. The turkey was my doing as well – I thought it would make a good distraction.”<br><br>Tiger fought to keep the smug look off his face. “Why did you do it?” he asked, genuinely puzzled.<br><br>“Can’t you work it out?”<br><br>“It was some kind of test…” Tiger said quickly. His father was always testing everyone around him. <br><br>He hesitated. “You wanted to see… how we coped without you… Am I right?”<br><br>“Absolutely!” said Francis, smiling. “And I’m afraid you rather failed this particular test. Now, shall we all proceed to the dining room? The <i>real</i> turkey is cooked to perfection.”<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve finally re-subscribed to SWTOR for the first time in a long time.  A while back on our Discord I had mentioned joining up with PPCers.  There was some degree of interest, but it never really went anywhere.<br><br>So I figured I would post it to the Board to see what interest there is.  Either in just joint questing or perhaps establishing a Roleplaying Guild initially targeted for PPC players.  <br><br>Now is a good time as any to join/rejoin as there is an extra EXP event going on (at least for Subs, I cannot confirm if it is for F2P).  For those interested my Characters with Levels are on the Star Forge server.<br><br>If your interested just let me know here your Character&#39;s Name, Faction, and Server.  I have a 50+ Republic Character, a 50+ Empire Character, and a 70+ Empire Character, as well as multiple lower level characters depending on how you want to participate. </p>

            <p>A Guild seems like a good idea to me, assuming that we can get this off the ground. In all honesty, I probably wouldn&#39;t do too much RP (outside of picking my character&#39;s responses in the dialogue trees - if I&#39;m playing the game then I probably want to actually be <i>playing</i> the game), but it&#39;d be useful to have a group to go to, and I&#39;m sure there would be other useful stuff - like access to the guild shared storage. I had a couple of high level crafters that I used to use to give my mates and I an edge when we were playing regularly,  back before all the Zakuul nonsense, and ridiculous XP gain. I don&#39;t know if player-crafted gear will actually be relevant now that you can gain levels so quick, but they might be able to create some useful stuff for sharing around. <br><br>My main is an Imperial Operative named Sephler, on the Darth Malgus server. I don&#39;t really have a Republic main at the moment, because there wasn&#39;t much point once the two factions got merged into one storyline. If you do make a character on Darth Malgus feel free to drop me a line. <br><br>There&#39;s also a couple of other people I know that might be up for joining in: the guys I used to play with, and an ex-WoW player or two that used to do raids - they might be interested in the group content like flashpoints. I could reach out and see if they&#39;re interested, if you&#39;d like? I know you originally pitched it as &#39;PPCers playing SWTOR&#39;, but it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s that many of us that play. <br><br>-Irish<br><br> </p>

            <p>I remember experimenting with some characters on the US servers when the server character limits were much lower, and I only had lag issues in high population areas like the space stations (although I had slight lag issues in those areas in the European servers anyway). I suspect a bigger issue may simply be time difference / availability. <br><br>Through various consolidations, all of my characters are on the Darth Malgus server. I&#39;ve got one of each class to 50+, with a few extras thrown in at various levels. Only really progressed through the more recent expansions with one character - well, what was the point in running it multiple times when all the content would be virtually identical?<br><br>One thing that I&#39;d be very much interested in, if possible, would be getting groups together to run the flashpoints (and, dare I dream, the Operations?). I think I&#39;ve seen pretty much all the content you can see as a solo player, but I&#39;ve barely seen anything intended for groups. Which still seems a bit odd for an MMO.<br><br>So yeah, I usually only return once or twice a year to run the new content with my main, but I&#39;d be up for playing regularly again if I could do something fresh. Playing the old content with a new group would be different and interesting enough, but seeing the content I&#39;ve been missing out on so far would be best. <br><br>-Irish</p>

            <p>This is my first real post (I&#39;m not counting my introduction post or the Boarders according to Willis thing), so yay! Now that I&#39;ve been introduced to the PPC I&#39;ve been noticing tropes in the books I read a lot more than I did before, and thought it might be fun to see what books Boarders have found that contain a lot of tropes.<br><br> If you want to add a book full of tropes, please start with the title of the book so others can avoid unwanted spoilers, and list some of the plot and the tropes in the book.<br><br> For me, one of the most trope filled series I have read is the Summoner series. It starts out with an orphan being left outside a remote town and adopted by a kind yet stern man, who helps him grow into a good moral boy. This trope often occurs so that we feel empathy for the protagonist but they still have a guiding figure. The boy, named Fletcher, is very hard working and kind. He is fairly poor and is enemies with the son of the richest man in town. This is a huge trope; sometimes it seems that every poor child in a novel has a rich enemy. The rich kid tries to murder him after Fletcher beats him in a tavern brawl with the help of a tramp that the rich kid mocked, but Fletcher discovers he can summon demons in this moment of need. He is forced to flee town and goes to a magic academy where he learns to cast spells and summon more demons. He makes a friend group from other unpopular kids, and they are often picked on by the snotty nobles, because there&#39;s no such thing as a nice high-born person. Oh, except the elf Fletcher has a crush on but the nobles hate. So here we have the tropes of the rich and the poor at odds AND a forbidden love type trope. They work hard and catch up to the nobles despite their advantages, and Fletcher manages to win the final magic competition at the end of the year despite the judges cheating and showing favor to the nobles. Another example of the rich vs poor trope, where the hard working poor boy beats the nobles in a &quot;surprise turn of events&quot;. He also learns that the demon he owns is very rare and slightly more powerful than average, and one that has only ever been wielded by their enemies. This is another trope, where the protagonist has unusual and slightly dark powers that no one really understands. My summary here is obviously biased towards showing the tropes, but they&#39;re apparent at every turn in this novel. (Also, this book has a similar plot and similar tropes to Harry Potter, but I won&#39;t go into that)<br><br> Another novel with an even more unbearable trope for me is The Ship of the Dead, the last book of the Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard series. In this book, Magnus has to defeat the god Loki, and challenges him to an insult contest that shrinks the loser down to the size of a powerless bug. But Magnus doesn&#39;t win the insult contest through insults, oh no, he does it through telling Loki about how wonderful Magnus&#39;s friends are and about the power of friendship, and telling Loki that he is all alone. This is a lovely message, but very, very common. It&#39;s also much too in-your-face. Magnus is quite literally saved by &quot;the magic of friendship&quot;. Not even by his friends themselves, but by essentially the concept of friendship. If this was through a sacrifice or finding strength in his friends this would be fine, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s quite literally a speech/rant that defeats a god.<br><br> Well that&#39;s all I have, I look forward to learning about other tropes filled books!</p>

            <p>As Mikey Neumann recently put it, &quot;if you repeatedly tear stories down to their bones, all stories look like nothing but bones&quot;. To me, it doesn&#39;t necessarily matter that genre or stylistic tropes are present in a given work. Far more important is what the author or actor or director or whatever is <i>doing</i> with them. Otherwise, you&#39;re not engaging with the work. You&#39;re just going THIS HAPPENED SOMEWHERE ELSE <b><i>DING</i></b>.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll admit that I was very sarcastic about the tropes in these two books, partly for humor and partly because they are very predictable tropes. What I was trying to do with this post is get a collection of books with tropes and the tropes in them as a way to get a sense of what tropes are most common in books, and what genres have a lot of tropes in general. I also wanted to see if I recognized any of the books listed as a way to learn more about the books I like. I definitely wasn&#39;t trying to create a list of &quot;bad books&quot;; I enjoyed both of the series that I mentioned. I don&#39;t think that having a lot of tropes necessarily makes a book bad, but I do think that it can often make a book predictable and less engaging since you can guess what&#39;s going happen. I agree with what you say about only looking at the tropes in a book. I don&#39;t read through books looking for tropes, I just notice them while looking back on the book.</p>

            <p>Just a little, though. While it does help to have a realistic or less-used portrayal of the trope, seeing something you&#39;ve seen before can make you start predicting what&#39;s going to happen next, which in turn detaches you from the story. Unless it&#39;s satire, in which case you end up loving it more.<br><br>That&#39;s why, when my writer friends use common tropes, I warn them to be careful on not just how they handle these things, but, yes, how many they use.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t enjoy stories less because of that. I&#39;m a technically minded person, and I enjoy looking at the nuts and bolts of things.

And then there&#39;s the DLC where you&#39;re in a mental hospital. Much trope.<br><br>Yandere Simulator is about high school anime tropes, and even stars one, the infamous yandere archetype. Among the other characters are the other dere types, the Japanese equivalent to a mom friend, the genki girl, a bunch of busty women who are in one way or another linked to sex, and of course, your senpai, who everyone else really wants. Better sharpen those knives.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Mostly with new cheat code modes and other Easter eggs, but definitely with a lot of new content, too. YandereDev is pretty intent on fleshing out his tropey world. And I&#39;m impressed by the amount of work he&#39;s put into it. But I can still see why the folks at your school didn&#39;t like people playing a game about violence at a high school.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Not going to post the whole fic as it&#39;s fifty-four pages long, but here&#39;s the prologue. <br><br>Prologue<br> In a clearing in the middle of a lush green forest was an old, large rock, bleached white from many moons of sun. Four huge oaks stood around it, old and withered, but immensely tall. There was a rustle in the nearby bushes, and a flame-coloured tom padded out. He padded to the rock and leaped onto it with his muscular hind legs. He seemed to be waiting for something. A moment later a small black-and-white tom with a very long tail padded out of the bushes. <br>“Tallstar! Good to see you again!” mewed the flame-coloured cat. Tallstar nodded. <br>“And you, Firestar. Have you seen the others?” Firestar shook his head. Just then, a huge white tom with jet black paws joined them, dwarfing his companion, a spotted she-cat. <br>“Blackstar! Leopardstar! What kept you?” asked Tallstar. Blackstar sighed. <br>“Stonefur came along. He wanted to know what we were doing.” The bushes rustled once more, and a grey-and-white tom joined them. <br>“Sorry I’m late,” he mewed, “but it’s a long journey.” Firestar raised his tail in greeting. <br>“Cloudstar, it’s moons since I last saw you!” Cloudstar purred. <br>“You too. Without you, I wouldn’t be here.”<br>A fifth cat joined them. He was almost as large as Blackstar, but a dark, mud-splattered, grey.<br>“Greetings. I meant to arrive sooner, but I lost track of the time.”<br>“Does any cat here know when moonhigh is?” Blackstar mewed sarcastically.<br>“Typical ShadowClan!” This was the first time Leopardstar had spoken.<br> Another cat came through the bushes, small, blind and ugly. He was followed by a badger. <br>“At last!” mewed Blackstar. “Now can we start?” The ugly cat, Rock, nodded. <br>“Six moons have passed since the Great Battle.” The seven cats and the badger nodded. <br>“Clans have enjoyed moons of peace.”  , the badger murmured. <br>“But a new evil is rising.” mewed Rock. “Five Clans and Tribe will be in danger.” They padded through the bushes to another clearing, in the centre of which was a large, clear pool. <br>“One cat alone can save Clans.” growled the badger.  The seven cats and the badger stared into the misty depths of the pool. For a moment the water shimmered, and then the cats and the badger could see, in the depths, a light brown she-cat and a russet-brown tom curled up in the hollow in the roots of an old elm tree.<br> “She is the one.” The group all nodded. <br>“Bright leaves can halt darkness.” mewed Rock. “I will tell Jayfeather.” The badger nodded.  “That is good. All six must know. Tell Willowshine, Kestrelflight, Echosong, Littlecloud and Stoneteller.<br>Rock mewed, “Each leader should tell their own healer. Firestar? You must explain it to her.” Then the group merged into the bushes, and the pool shimmered once more, and then returned to clear water, as if nothing had happened. <br><br><br><br>Apologies for the lack of paragraph breaks; I&#39;m reproducing the original format. *cringes madly*<br></p>

            <p>One of HQ's moderately-sized empty rooms was nowhere near empty a few hours before 2019 began (in UTC on World One, because that seemed like the easiest reference point). A string of large paper numbers covered in gold glitter, spelling out "2019",  had been hung from the ends of the ceiling. The far end of the room held tables piled with all sorts of party food (including something rather tasty that looked like blue spaghetti) and drinks. About half of the room contained tables of varying heights, some of which had chairs. The tables had started out with large stocks of noisemakers,  paper hats, and masks, though a few of them were running low. The other half of the room didn't have much furniture so everyone could mingle. The dancefloor was near the door, shielded with sound dampening to prevent the rest of the party from being drowned in the music.  Balloons hung in the air, either still tied to something or drifting.</p>

<p>Overall, everything seemed to be set up for a good party[1].  Some people were already in attendance, while the main group of partygoers was still filling in.</p>

<p>[1]: Assuming, of course, that the food and drink kept coming. Otherwise, it would be less of a party and more of a minor riot roaming the hallways looking for the promissed free refreshments.</p>

            <p>A garish green vending machine and his hoodie wearing friend walk in. The vending machine looked festive, wearing a gold top hat style party hat and Mardi Gras party beads while twirling one of those noise makers. "Oh yeah, time to make 2019 twenty fine-teen!"</p>

<p>His less than festive companion gave him a deadpan. "3 seconds in and I already need drink. Thank you Spensor."</p>

            <p>She was alone; after the disaster that had been Halloween Edward had point-blank refused to come. That suited her, as she was able to socialise without her embarrassing brother tagging along and annoying everyone. </p>

<p>Kat wore a simple pale blue dress made of light material and fairly unremarkable black shoes - not high heels, they were far too uncomfortable for her. </p>

<p>Glancing around, she saw that there weren't many people (or other sentient beings) there yet. She wandered over to one of the tables and picked up an orange paper hat, which she placed carefully on her head. It was a little big but would probably stay balanced if she didn't move around too much. She considered a plain white mask but decided against it. Kat preferred to be recognised.</p>

<p>She wandered over to the food and drink table, making up her mind that she'd have a few snacks and maybe a drink and wait to see if anyone wanted to talk to her.</p>

            <p>Since last year&#39;s NYGE didn&#39;t pan out so well, you know what this means... It&#39;s time to start a new one! So without further ado, here be the rules:<br><br><b>ADMISSION AND SETUP:</b><br>1. You need to have Permission and at least two agents to enter this event. You don&#39;t have to have the teams participate in their entirety, either - any one of your agents can opt out based on whatever&#39;s most convenient for you.<br>2. All Boarders and agents will be going in basically blind - meaning that nobody will know who sent what until all the gifts have been opened! Hence, in order to enter, send me an e-mail (my address is clickable) with your attending agents and which gift each will bring. This may be either a &quot;souvenir&quot; from a mission you&#39;ve published previously, or just something they happen to have that they want to give away. As soon as you&#39;ve sent the e-mail, reply to this post with the word &quot;Sent&quot; and no message content, so everyone will know who&#39;s participating.<br>3. For the sake of organization, I will take just four or five other Boarders for this year&#39;s event, so the first five Boarders to submit applications will be the ones attending.<br>4. Anyone with Permission can host this event. One of their agents must serve as an in-universe host for this event, but all agents are required to participate as players, including the host. I will confirm who the host will be if and when anyone steps forward - otherwise, Falchion will be the host this year. (My other participating agents will be my DIC and DMS-VG teams, but no other agents of mine will be participating, for some very spoilery reasons.)<br><br><b>EVENT RULES:</b><br>5. Once everything&#39;s been set up, the Boarder volunteering the event host will set up an introductory post on the T-Board for this event. The most important rule: NOBODY MUST KNOW WHAT THE GIFTS ARE UNTIL THEY&#39;VE OPENED THEM. All of the gifts will be wrapped and put in a big pile at the start of the game.<br>6. Once I&#39;ve tallied the full list, I&#39;ll provide a list of the players, and a list of the gifts, but not a list of who sent what. The starting player will then be selected at random. Then when that player opens a gift, the agent who submitted it must speak up and confirm that they were the one who did so. Then that agent is the next to play! Thus, in general, the person who will play during each turn is the one who volunteered the gift revealed during the previous turn.<br>7. For each turn, the agent currently in play can either choose a gift from the pile (I&#39;ll provide the full list of gifts on the Posting Board) or, if others before them have already chosen gifts, they can &quot;steal&quot; a gift from the previous owner. A gift can be stolen up to twice; after that, it is locked to the agent it&#39;s ended up with, and cannot be stolen again. Note also that if a gift is stolen from any agent, THEY CANNOT STEAL IT BACK.<br>8. The game ends once everyone has received a gift. Since the first agent cannot steal, he/she will be given the choice to steal after everyone else has played.<br><br>Once again, if anyone wishes to participate, just send me an e-mail with the agents planned to be involved and the gifts they&#39;ll bring. Let&#39;s hope it works out for real this coming year!<br><br>In the meantime, after over <i>two years</i> of not being able to write a single mission, I decided to finally get off my tail this past week and put one under Lilac&#39;s belt. So here&#39;s a healthy dose of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S26aR5yeGorMFcQRgi8-KraNOHsWHrgdsMS4WJntcro/edit?usp=sharing">&quot;Tunnel Vision&quot;</a>, wherein she is led by Falchion and Sarah into a <i>Team Fortress 2</i>/<i>The Incredibles</i> crossover and ends up facing an existential nightmare. Enjoy, guys!<br><br>(BTW, this mission doesn&#39;t count towards the countdown to Operation: [REDACTED], because it&#39;s an immediate follow-up to the aftermath of said operation - though without spoilers pertaining to it, don&#39;t worry.)<br><br>Now, onto 2019!</p>

            <p>I think you did a good job in this mission of laying out the tension between Lilac and the more veteran agents.  The question of Lilac’s identity is constantly on all their minds, but rather than having the characters talk about it bluntly, you let it simmer in the background.  It bubbles out into the dialogue occasionally, but mostly, you communicate it through speech tone and facial expression.  That said, I’m not totally on-board with the conclusion to the conflict.  Right in the opening scene, you establish that while Lilac believes herself to be <i>a</i> Violet Parr, she already recognizes that doesn’t necessarily make her the same as the one in the movie:<br><br><i>&quot;&#39;I know it sounds weird, coming from someone who diverged from Vi a long time ago, but I at least have the decency to take her character seriously,&#39; said the newbie.&quot;</i><br><br>[Sarah] <i>still couldn’t believe that the new girl had yet to accept that she was not, in fact, an alternate-universe Violet in all but name.</i><br><br>This at least shows that, even if Lilac is choosing to believe herself the canon Violet, she also recognizes that alternate universe versions of a character can exist, and she even refers to Violet as a separate character.  So at the end of the story, I don’t understand Lilac’s surprise when the Violet in the fic turns out to be the real one.  It seems to me she was already aware of the possibility of other Violets being real, so potentially, this wouldn’t even change her beliefs.  Is there some aspect to her character or history I’m not understanding?<br><br>I liked that you had your agents discuss the fact that <i>Team Fortress</i> isn’t a very rigid canon, and that they weren’t judging the badfic on that angle.  I like to communicate in the mission when things aren’t charge-worthy, or are only ambiguously so, so it’s good to see other PPCers do the same!  I also loved the gag behind the disguises.  Very clever!<br><br>Some typos:<br><br>&quot;&#39;<i>Team Fortress 2</i>,&#39; <b>Sarah</b> explained. &#39;It’s like, this darkly comedic team-based first-person shooter. That’s where the Spy is from, and I think he’s a lot older than, say, Tony Rydinger, for example…&#39;<br>&#39;I’m not so concerned about that.&#39; <b>Sarah</b> punched her palm. &#39;Isn’t Vi only fourteen?!&#39;&quot;<br>Sarah is talking to herself.<br><br>&quot;&#39;Besides, I’ve been wondering…&#39;<br>&#39;<b>Of</b> what, exactly?&#39; asked Falchion, earning him a slightly annoyed look from his adopted sister.&quot;<br>I’m not familiar with &quot;wonder of&quot; being used as a verb phrase.  I think you can drop the &quot;of&quot; here and retain the same meaning.  It sounds a bit awkward to me this way.<br><br>&quot;The agents stepped out of the portal and back into the base, abandoning a plate of cold bacon that had been sitting there in the kitchen. Said bacon was gone in a matter of minutes, courtesy of Falchion.&quot;<br>For me, abandoning food means <i>not</i> eating it.  Unless you meant they’re abandoning an empty plate that formerly contained bacon?  But &quot;a plate of cold bacon&quot; reads to me as a plate still containing bacon, so I’m a  little confused about the meaning here.<br><br>&quot;The agents hid in the very darkest corner of the room as her gaze fell upon <b>them</b> the men before her, and then focused on Violet herself.&quot;<br>Extra word.<br><br>&quot;There was this one time, for example, when she and the canon Stratogale had <b>laid eyes</b>, and the poor agent had gone into a minor existential meltdown, not that she’d let her companions know it.&quot;<br>I know this phrase as &quot;laid eyes on each other.&quot;  I’ve never seen &quot;laid eyes&quot; used in that shortened form before.  If that’s longer than you wanted in that sentence, you could also potentially use &quot;met eyes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Maybe it’s ‘cuz she’s too young for the job?&#39; asked Sarah.<br>The agents were silent for a few moments.<br>&#39;Or maybe,&#39; <b>she</b> mumbled, &#39;that is NOT the real me.&#39;&quot;<br>I’m pretty sure that &quot;she&quot; is supposed to be Lilac, but as these sentences stand, it sounds like it’s Sarah speaking more.<br><br>&quot;&#39;. . . by order of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, you are hereby charged with being a character replacement on account of willingly agreeing to being conscripted to the BLU team, knowing full-well that they can’t care less about the lives of others, and are willing to take <b>them</b> if it means getting paid.&#39;&quot;<br>That &quot;them&quot; is out of place in this sentence; there wasn’t really a plural noun before it for &quot;them&quot; to serve as a pronoun for.  Were you maybe wanting to say &quot;take those terms&quot; or some-such?<br><br>—doctorlit in a busy week</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad a lot of my strengths showed through with this mission, and while I was worried that the discussions of whether Lilac is the real Violet or not would overtake the story itself, I&#39;m glad you feel they fit in well enough! You can thank 1visible for the idea of the paper masks; the previous draft involved the agents basically cosplaying as some of the mercs, but their suggestion was even funnier and made SO much more sense. xD<br><br>That sentence you bought up as an issue was actually an artifact from a previous version of the story I had planned, where Lilac acknowledged herself to be different from Violet and, as such, was more upset at the way Violet was being treated on principle rather than projecting herself onto the canon character like in this version. When I go back over this mission to fix the typos you discussed (thanks btw!), I&#39;m probably going to change it to:<br><br>&quot;&#39;I know it sounds weird, coming from me, but I at least have the decency to take my character seriously, even if I&#39;m no longer wearing my old suit,&#39; said the newbie.&quot;<br><br>Or something like that. And I&#39;ll probably look over the rest of it and adjust her dialogue accordingly so Lilac believes herself to be the real Violet, which actually WAS a part of her creative history. Let&#39;s just say that V-Wrex wasn&#39;t my only attempt at writing Vi over the years, which isn&#39;t surprising considering that I crushed on her when I was like ELEVEN or so, to the point where I had a version of her as an imaginary friend.<br><br>...Hmm. Now I&#39;m seriously tempted to send poor Lilac into a <i>Foster&#39;s Home For Imaginary Friends</i> badfic someday...</p>

            <p>This is one of the rare occasions when someone&#39;s said that I haven&#39;t made SPaG errors, so it&#39;s nice to see my writing&#39;s improved over the years! I&#39;ve been practicing. ;)<br><br>That last bit with Lilac hugging her shield was my favorite part of this mission to write; it was in fact one of the first things I typed for it, since to me it really sells Lilac&#39;s acceptance that she&#39;s not the same as canon!Vi. Also, the arrow was in fact not connected to the scene dividers, being instead based on a literal take on a choice of words in the fic itself. It would&#39;ve been interesting to weaponize the dividers at one point lol, but I couldn&#39;t find any room. Oh well, maybe in a future mission...<br><br>Hopefully 2019 will give me more opportunities to write more missions! God knows I could use a ton of those lately... X&#39;D</p>

            <p>In both cases where you wrote &quot;bought&quot;, I think you actually meant &quot;brought&quot;, and in the final notes, &quot;spoke&quot; should probably be &quot;spork&quot;.<br><br>I’ve gone invisible for longer than ever, but I’m still lurking, and I still can’t not notice these things.<br><br>Happy New Year.<br><br>HG</p>
