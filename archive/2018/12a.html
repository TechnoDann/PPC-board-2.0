            <p>Hello there, Board! I found this place because I&#39;m Twistey&#39;s boyfriend and she told me to come here! I&#39;ve read through about 17 or 18 of the original story, and so far I like Makes-Things the most. I like reading a lot, especially fantasy and science fiction books. The books and series I like most are Artemis Fowl, The summoner, The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, Septimus Heap, and The Dwarves. I like puzzles such as Rubik&#39;s Cubes and knotwork, as well as creative writing and DnD. Any advice you have for me on the board would be appreciated. (I&#39;ve already read the FAQ, the FAQ for Newbies, and the Constitution but I haven&#39;t signed yet.)</p>

            <p>Hi, PPC board! This is my first post in this community, and I am happy to be part of one!<br><br>Favourite books: The Hobbit, Alice in Wonderland, countless dinosaur books.<br><br>Favourite fandoms: Tolkien&#39;s works, anything to do with fantasy.<br><br>Here&#39;s a story I wrote!<br><br>&quot;The hunter stepped through the portal his time belt produced in front of him. He planned to travel back to the early Cenozoic, to hunt some early lemurs or something. He didn&#39;t really know what his objective was. Anyway, whatever the plan, he was going to do something. He entered the portal.<br><br>The portal happened to lead to the Eocene Messel formation. The hunter spend his time dodging Gastornis, killing Leptictidium and Godinotia and pummelling Eurotamandua. Eventually, the hunter got bored and started jumping around like a spoilt brat having a temper tantrum. Suddenly he had a brainwave - he was going to travel before the dinosaurs.<br><br>He opened another portal with his time belt, leading to the late Permian. He walked through, with a dazed Eurotamandua hanging uncertainly to his backpack. As he entered the portal the confused xenarthran hopped off, crashing onto the ground. The hunter saw a completely different landscape.<br><br>There were sand and rocks as far as he could see, with volcanos bordering the western and northern sides of the lands. There was a forest in the middle. &quot;That&#39;s where I&#39;m going to go.&quot; The hunter said. He walked nearer and saw a predator, around 3 metres long. A Gorgonops. &quot;They probably hunt in packs so I&#39;m gonna kill it to attract more of &#39;em.&quot; He said.<br><br>He got out his sniper and shot at the Gorgonops. The proto-mammal yelped and fell on its side. Dead. He walked over to the body and stepped on something. Some sort of therocephalian, he thought. As the creature stopped struggling, he suddenly felt sick. As if he had done something seriously, seriously wrong.<br><br>A lion-like roar echoed across the landscape as another Gorgonops appeared. It roared at the hunter, who tried shooting it. His gun clicked. He tried to activate his time belt, yet didn&#39;t succeed. The creature charged as he finally managed to activate the time belt and run through.<br><br>He was greeted by a coastline in some unknown era. He looked around and saw what looked like a reptilian seal behind him. &quot;What the ... hell are you?&quot; he said, once again feeling sick. The creature let out a seal-like bark as the man screamed and disappeared.&quot;<br><br>Thanks for reading this!</p>

            <p>Only constructive criticism I have is how much the hunter seems like he&#39;s surmounting challenges a little too fast, but I know it&#39;s a very short, abridged story and that can be fixed by expanding it more. I&#39;d like to hear more about it, though.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m Twistey, or you can call me Twisted, &#39;cause it fits me. I&#39;m the PPC&#39;s resident catalyst of chaos. If you have an idea that likely won&#39;t fly by the rest of the Boarders, you can bet I&#39;ll take interest. I also write original stories, but none of them involve dinosaurs. I believe that&#39;s all I can say right now.<br><br>As for your newbie gift, here&#39;s a grab bag of Jurassic Park merch. I figured you&#39;d love to have one. No, there&#39;s no amber with a mosquito in it. I&#39;ve trusted newbies with powerful genetics-altering substances before, but I can&#39;t trust a newbie with that. *wink*<br><br>Nice to meet you! I hope you have a great time here, and welcome to the PPC.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hey.<br><br>This is more a personal update than anything else, and it&#39;s *not* going to be a fun read. So please, don&#39;t feel pressured to read this.<br><br>You might&#39;ve heard about this if you hang around the PPC Discord a lot, but my mother died unexpectedly two days ago.<br><br>I&#39;m telling you guys this because even though I don&#39;t tend to hang around the Board a lot (I&#39;m more active on the Discord), you guys are my friends, and I don&#39;t want to leave you in the dark about why I might not seem like my usual self for a while.<br><br>And this is also a shoutout to everyone here who&#39;s given me support. Times like these, it&#39;s the little things that count. All your kind words, all your prayers, all your hugs, they mean more to me than I can possibly articulate.<br><br>When the Raven calls, what choice do we have but to stick together? And when she calls for us, what choice do we have but to go?<br><br>Thank you. For everything.<br><br>I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d be without you guys.</p>

            <p>Heyo everyone! Every once in a blue moon I pop in and this time I am here with news about <a "http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2018/href">Tumblr banning 18+ content</a> which could also potentially result in blog deletions ala Strikethrough.<br><br>I personally don&#39;t think I will be too affected by it, but I also know the algorithm for flagging NSFW stuff on that site atm is a bit wack, and I think there&#39;s a slight chance my PPC missions may be caught up in it. If there&#39;s interest in preserving whatever I wrote in my PPC tag, I can send someone archive/Google Doc versions of them? Let me know, otherwise I may just leave them on my works Tumblr... or eventually find time to import them to WordPress or DW or something.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep anyone interested posted about the sitch because if I do switch the missions to another platform I&#39;ll probably need to change the links on the Wiki or something. So yeah.</p>

            <p>Though it didn&#39;t pan out quite like Ix said.<br><br>The Sues were actually from different stories, and the agents on different missions; but since they were so similar (I think it was that both Sues were &quot;the most beautiful woman Jack had ever seen&quot;), they sort of started bleeding into one another. The Sues fought and the one with the more cohesive story (including SPaG!) won.</p>

            <p>Wow, yeah, this kind of scene looks like it was tough to write.  Very introspective and subtle; I&#39;m not sure I even could have managed it!  You guys did a good job, though.  It&#39;s a little too abstract for me to really go int detail about <i>why</i> it feels so real, but it very definitely does have the right feeling about it.  The visualization of Derik&#39;s feelings through Thoth&#39;s sensations of them was interesting, and felt appropriateyl complex and shifting.  I&#39;m a bit saddened by Derik&#39;s mental health state being a bit worse than I though up until now, but I&#39;m glad he&#39;s a got a meditation teacher to help him through it.<br><br>One specific thing I like is the contrast between the first two scenes and the third.  When we&#39;re inside Thoth&#39;s mind, his emotions and thoughts are stated plainly, showing his straightforward and calculating way of thinking.  Then the last scene is largely from Tom&#39;s perspective, and we see how inscrutable and closed Thoth is to the outside observer.<br><br>—doctorlit, reading things</p>

            <p>Thanks!<br><br>Yeah, Derik does look pretty rough here. In part it&#39;s because this is a less comedic piece, and as such it&#39;s also the first opportunity I&#39;ve had (or taken) to show how I&#39;ve imagined him to be between missions, without anything to distract him: volatile, even hostile, and generally difficult to be around. Also, I figure his ability to keep a lid on it has deteriorated as he&#39;s adjusted to life in the PPC and the bizarre has become mundane. At first there was culture shock, adventure, a kender, near-constant adrenaline; now, not so much. He&#39;s cultivated active hobbies to make up for it—exercise, AHAIRQ, carousing with teammates—but now Thoth is asking him to do precisely the opposite of that. And doesn&#39;t seem to get why his distant, calculated approach is not helpful...<br><br>~Neshomeh lives for overly detailed psychological analysis of characters.</p>

            <p>Thoth will certainly take some convincing about how alike they are. Derik, not so much, but this really didn&#39;t go like he wanted it to. There are some fairly significant differences in approach and outlook to be overcome. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Masterfully done. The way they rebound off each other is...complex yet somehow relatable.  I very much look forward to seeing it from the other end in the next part.<br>Honestly, though, my favorite part is exploring the developing bond between the two. How it&#39;s full of emotion and tension without being cliche (not that I&#39;d expect cliches from either of you) or overly angsty for the sake of being angsty. &quot;Everything has a purpose...the Emperor ordains it so,&quot;  and every word of this piece did exactly what it meant to do.<br>Side note, have we got M:tG alignments for either of them?

            <p>Well, I&#39;d say the Angels are closer to Black/Blue with their focus on secrecy and their stratified knowledge and revelations as a Marine progresses further through the ranks.  (Some may never reach the final layers of secrets or know the real motives behind the Hunt.  Leonidas, as a Company Master, has served in the Deathwing and is thus a full member of the Inner Circle, however.)  And Black as primary reflects their willingness to sacrifice their honor and even their lives as penance for the actions of their predecessors, the Fallen.  Supreme Grand Master Azrael reflects in Legacy of Caliban that should their worst fears be realized and the Dark Angels&#39; secrets are exposed, they will not fire a single shot in self-defense against the Imperium.<br>At the same time, there&#39;s an argument, made by Master of Sanctity Sapphon, I think, that the Chapter must survive at all costs, on the grounds that many more innocents will die without the Dark Angels  to defend them.  Considering the clout of the Unforgiven Chapters as a whole, he&#39;s not just bragging. And I think the High Lords and the Inquisition appear to recognize this as well, which is why they accept the Dark Angels&#39; zealotry and outstanding battle record as an excuse for their isolationist and questionable (at times) actions.</p>

            <p>So! Leonidas himself strikes me more, as you said, Black/White. Mostly because he hasn&#39;t let the Hunt and the secrets of the Chapter overtake his personality and ideals, such as they are. He&#39;s stoic to a fault, and does his best to keep in mind that he, too, was once mortal.  He holds onto his ideals of discipline and leading by example with a deathgrip, and has taken to heart the Lion&#39;s teachings--namely, being slow to anger and quick to action.<br>As for Sammy, he&#39;s definitely White/Red--outgoing and animated where Leo is grim and silent.  He&#39;s friendly and up for almost anything, yet difficult to truly provoke. In Gunpla battles--the closest he&#39;s been to combat of any sort as of yet--he fights defensively at first and gradually shifts to a more offensive and hotblooded stance and attitude as he gets the measure of his opponent, until he puts them on the backfoot and presses the advantage home.  It doesn&#39;t always work, of course, but he&#39;d say that&#39;s no loss since it&#39;s Gunpla battle, not war, and he learns things even when he loses.</p>

            <p>So nearly Christmas, but not yet. Back to the traditional format of Prompts for this one (although Sprint Prompts will return).

            <p>Tiger glanced at his watch. It was precisely midnight. “Happy new year!” he announced, smiling as he looked round at his fellow boys. “May it bring many victories!”<br><br>“To victories!” echoed Tim, Andy and Seb. They all raised their plastic cups and took a swig of lemonade. The solemn note was rather ruined when Tiger coughed: the lemonade had been a little fizzier than he’d expected.<br><br>“Time to change watch,” Tiger added. Seb groaned but got to his feet, working his way past the blankets to the exit of the en-suite bathroom.<br> <br>A couple of minutes later, the three remaining boys were joined by Robin.<br><br>“Fancy a round of cards?” asked Andy.<br><br>“You’re only saying that because you always win!” said Tiger. “I think we should go over the plan again.”<br><br>There was a collective groan.<br><br>“What’s the signal?” Tiger asked.<br><br>“A red flag dangling from the ceiling,” said Robin. “Seb’ll stick it out as soon as he sees the girls.”<br><br>“And what are you each going to do?” said Tiger, pointing at Andy first.<br><br>“I’m the emergency backup,” announced Andy. “I get to stay where I am!”<br><br>Tiger nodded. “Tim?”<br><br>“I go and sit out and twiddle my thumbs to lure the girls in,” said Tim.<br><br>“Robin?”<br><br>“I sneak round the right line of blankets to ambush.”<br><br>“And I’ll take the other side,” Tiger concluded. “The door should be unlocked, so what happens when the girls come in?”<br><br>There was a pause. Tim filled the silence. “Seb shuts the door with his lever up there once two of them are in. Then Robin and Tiger launch their ambush.”<br><br>Tiger nodded. “Now, there’s a high probability that Holly will try and blast the door in, which means we need to work quickly to avoid being overwhelmed. Aim to – “ he made quotation marks with his fingers – “kill them more or less straight away. If we’ve lost no more than one – ideally, we shouldn’t lose any – by the time we’re done, we attack. We’ll outnumber them and we can beat them easily. If we don’t win, everyone except me attacks. Aim to take out as many as possible no matter what. If you could leave Holly to me, that would be great, but don’t worry if not.

            <p>Amber waited. Jokes about going to some spaceship and being KILL BY DEMONS made her smile, even as reality proved the spaceships to be in limited quantities and the demons all too real and in disturbingly large numbers.<br><br>Being a Trainee, she found herself in a position most actual Agents would&#39;ve envied: long periods of downtime without the Console BEEP!ing every time someone needed a break.<br>Amber would&#39;ve switched in a heartbeat. She <b>wanted</b>  to go out there and face the demons. She <b>wanted</b> her Console to finally, at oh so very long last, blare to life and assign her a Trainer, a partner, a mission, <i>anything</i>. <br>But instead her Console remained as silent as always, ever since she was first assigned her RC.<br><br>She sighed. Waiting was always the worst part.</p>

            <p>Crack a book or start playing a video game. Easy way to make the console go off right quick.<br><br>But yeah, this is overall pretty good (though short, so it&#39;s hard to have extensive comments), though I don&#39;t get the &quot;KILL BY DEMONS&quot; bit.

            <p>Reproduced below in its entirety:<br><br>John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn&#39;t see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br>John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad &quot;I want to be on the ships daddy.&quot;<br>Dad said &quot;No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS&quot;<br>There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.<br>&quot;This is Joson&quot; the radio crackered. &quot;You must fight the demons!&quot;<br>So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.<br>&quot;HE GOING TO KILL US&quot; said the demons<br>&quot;I will shoot at him&quot; said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br>&quot;No! I must kill the demons&quot; he shouted<br>The radio said &quot;No, John. You are the demons&quot;<br>And then John was a zombie.</p>

            <p>Ce’rana of Borune hummed softly as she pulled another stitch through, flicking her eyes back to the cloak hung from her tree. <i>Time to change colors again,</i> she thought as she compared the crest on its back to the incomplete copy on the cloth in her lap. She reached for her tiny, bird-beaked scissors to snip the blue thread short, then reached for the red spool to re-thread her needle.<br><br>Alex probably wouldn’t be happy if he found out Ce’rana had borrowed his cloak; it would be unavoidable come Erastide, but for now, her tree would keep quiet and it wouldn’t be difficult to hang it back where it belonged. The thing had been sitting in there untouched since they’d moved in, unless Alex had been using it when she wasn’t paying attention; there wasn’t much call for formal attire around HQ, especially not when it came to garments of situational practicality. In all likelihood, he wouldn’t even notice she’d gone into his wardrobe at all.<br><br>But even if he wasn’t wearing it often, Ce’rana had grown up around the Imperial Court. She knew how much a family crest meant, and there was nothing else this could possibly have been. Heraldry was the end-all be-all for some; in all likelihood that wasn’t the case for him given how rarely he displayed it, but still, having a hanging for his half of the room bearing something of such significance would have to be a joy.<br><br>The Dryad dipped needle back into cloth, humming a half-remembered melody to herself as she worked. Even if it turned out Alex hated this present, it would still be a gift given, and… well, maybe she wouldn’t enter it into the logbook after all. Even he deserved a break for Erastide.<br></p>

            <p>Ce&#39;rana definitely does <i>not</i> like her partner. It is simply Erastide, and it is custom to give gifts in celebration of the creation of the world. Something individually meaningful will of course build greater favor, and...<br><br>Yeah, we all know she actually does like Alex. She just wants to be a good friend-slash-partner-slash-sister. Bit difficult for her, but she <i>is</i> trying.<br><br>As for the thought processes - I&#39;ve got a thing I wrote a while back about that, with her just sorting through a couple things.

            <p>Alright, this is my second time asking this year. I am looking for Betas too look over my permission request. My agents are a slacker and a vending machine (no really). Our slacker has been assigned to oversee the Cybertronian agent&#39;s probation. Hilarity ensues.
