            <p>Since <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314971">the nomination thread</a> is rather dead at the moment and about to fall off the front page, it&#39;s about time to call some elections and ask for more opinions in others.<br><br>First off, I think it&#39;s safe to say, <b>Larfen J. Stocke, esq.</b> and <b>Hieronymus Graubart</b>, please come to the podium to receive your official Permission Giver hats! Congratulations, both of you.<br><br>Second, to keep all the results in one place, <b>Akrinor</b> has been elected as a Discord moderator for about two weeks now.<br><br>Third, I, <b>Tomash</b> was nominated for moderator (which, if it had gone through, would have been my second time holding that position per <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315192">this post</a>). Given that PoorCynic objected, and not many people actually had an opinion, I&#39;m going to say the nomination fails (barring the case that almost no one actually saw the nomination and a whole pile of people come out to be in favor of it).<br><br>Now, on to potentially unfinished business:<br><br><b>doctorlit</b> has six votes below, and the only person who&#39;s unsure about the nomination is doctorlit himself, who&#39;s concerned he won&#39;t be active enough to be a good PG.  I&#39;m currently interpreting <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315189">his post about this</a> as being hesitant about taking the job but not actually turning it down, so I&#39;ll say if we get another 5-6 more people in support of the nomination, doctorlit will get a hat too.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Yes, Diskord - with its rolling hills, and misty mornings, and the long fields of rustling grass, and all the wolves and buzzards that are constantly following me around waiting for me to be weakened enough by the elements to that they can eat me. <br><br>Ah, but the Riding of Sittories! How can I forget her gulleys, her dramatic crags, her majestic pine trees, like pillars to hold up Heaven itself, and the wild dogs and crows that replace the wolves and buzzards and also follow me around waiting to eat me. <br><br>But worry not for me! Call me not &#39;vagrant&#39; or &#39;homeless&#39;; for I am an eternal wanderer, and my castle is the land, itself - yes, all its high, cold places, to the damp, dark ones, with their roots and secrets. <br><br>But, y&#39;know, I think a shack would be nice. Or at least some sort of umbrella. And perhaps something to scare all the hungry wild animals off me. <br>I probably ought to get a proper flag, too, given that my current one, made out of a potato sack drawn on with charcoal, has been torn terribly over the years, partially on account of all those wolves and buzzards and such. <br><br>(I always <i>did</i> feel like my relationship to fandom and the PPC was generally pretty well analogous to an ambulatory homeless man<br><br>Lord knows how that Barony ended up on him!<br><br>And, uh, I should also probably figure that whole heraldry stuff out, too.) </p>

            <p>In those days, the citizens of Diskord were debating among themselves, for many of them had concerns about the state of the Confederation.<br><br>&quot;There should be a circle of Writin,&quot; many said, &quot;so we may properly worship the gods again.&quot;<br><br>The Dizzy Chords and even the cities of Borrd (for there had been some worry there about the Diskorders weakness of faith) rang out in support of this idea, and then the Mords made it so.<br><br>Then, through his stone, Sir Tomash spoke, saying &quot;We should build a hall of welcome at the port of Landen-zon, so that foreigners coming to our land may hear of the customs of Plort before venturing too far inland.&quot; The people of Diskord agreed this was a good idea, and the Mords made it so, setting aside a place for the hall, which was built and richly decorated with illustrations from the Efawkews.<br><br>Then, another proposal arose from the distributed crowd. &quot;We ought create a circle for discussions of the Marizu, so we may better prepare ourselves for battle.&quot; The Mords heard this, and, since they thought the proposal a good one, made it so. The new circle was named Badvik, after the mountains in which many of the knights of Plort had trained over the long years.<br><br>Since some discussion was going on, Baroness Juliette, who was speaking while traveling to the council, said &quot;Shall we elect new Mords? I often watch the stones alone, and this is wearying. There is also rarely any Mord awake when I sleep, leaving our fair land unwatched.&quot; The citizens chattered amongst themselves, and wondered who would make a good Mord. &quot;Not I&quot; said just about everyone, for their own reasons. Within the chatter came a shout, &quot;Akrinor for Mord!&quot;.<br><br>This proved to be a rather popular idea, since Akrinor was well-respected within the Confederation and often awake when the Mords slept. So the initial shout grew into a chant of &quot;AK-RIN-OR! AK-RIN-OR!&quot;<br><br>Akrinor was reluctant to take the power offered to him at first, but eventually he declared &quot;I will do it, for now. If, within the month, anyone objects to my rule or I realize I do not want the robe, I will step down.&quot;<br><br>Hearing this, Baron PC, who held the Master Stone, which could raise Mords, brought Akrinor to his castle. There, he draped a fine purple robe, the symbol of the Mords, over Akrinor, and stood before his stone, proclaiming: &quot;Ahteverione,&quot; he began, the magic words causing stones to glow or vibrate throughout Plort, &quot;behold Akrinor, the Mord you have chosen!&quot;<br><br>And thus, Akrinor joined the ranks of the Mords, kicking off a round of celebration and feasting throughout the land.<br><br>(( Since recent Discord stuff needing Plortifying.<br>Everyone with lines has approved of them.<br><br>- Tomash ))</p>

            <p>The classic geography of far-eastern Konti-Nyuum would say that Landen-zon is probably on the coast east of La Wunj, at the mouth of the Nechsiv. That&#39;s certainly possible, but it continues to leave the Diskord very empty, particularly in the east.<br><br>Is it possible that this is a previously-unmentioned port at the mouth of the Sozeri, down on the southern coast?

            <p>&#39;I can smell the blood on ye, hound! Ye blasphemous wolf, dripping in the blood of the innocent and the wretched! Away, away, I say!&#39; Larf J. Stockins waved his crossbow, his trusty Finch, in the air. It groaned and whined and was a single knock away from exploding into woody shards. This was fine for Larf J. Stockins, who tended to have more various injuries on his body than he did clean water. But it certainly wasn&#39;t for the courier. <br><br>&#39;Errrrrrr,&#39; said the courier, clutching the message, hunching down. It had actually not been particularly difficult to track down Larf J. Stockins, on account of the small battalion of carnivores that always seemed to follow him everywhere. You had a lot of things to follow - tracks, signs of destruction and struggle, blood, horrified villagers. <br>It was these signs that he followed, to here - a desolate coastal field, the wind battering the thin grass, sea mist swirling around the knifelike grey stones at the bottom of those warped layered cliffs. His hair was flowing, and his tunic, and the message flapped in his hands, trying to escape. It didn&#39;t seem very baronial. It might have made a good spot to dump the body of a baron you didn&#39;t like very much, but that was it. <br><br>&#39;Don&#39;t make me shoot! I will do it, sir! And even though I am entirely unable to restock my supply of bolts, for sheer lack of resources, shoot I will, if I find it necessary!&#39; <br><br>The messenger was trying to sweat, but the wind kept pulling it off his face. &#39;Sire, uh, Larf, I have a message for you.&#39; <br><br>&#39;And I to you!&#39; he, again, waved the crossbow at him. It groaned like a dying man. <br><br>&#39;You have become a baron, sire.&#39; <br><br>&#39;Er?&#39; Larf J. Stockins tilted his head. <br><br>&#39;It says so right here,&#39; said the messenger. The note spasmed in the wind, but it could be clearly seen that it included the word &#39;Baron&#39;, the name &#39;Larf J. Stockins&#39; and the seal on it. It was a collection of things Larf J. Stockins was certain he would never see together. It looked unjust, somehow. <br><br>&#39;Really? Why?&#39;<br><br>&#39;I don&#39;t know!&#39; <br><br>&#39;But - <i>why?</i>&#39; <br><br><br>((La Wunj is still an abandoned city sort of thing, isn&#39;t it? I could picture him <s>scavenging for bare survival</s> living around there, at times. Shack and all and such.))</p>

I&#39;m thinking Carnelian for Hieronymus and perhaps Tanzanite for Larfen, but am open to suggestions; the currently-active stones are listed <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Baron">here</a>, and we&#39;ve also had Jasper, Amber, and Topaz in use.

            <p>&quot;Lords and Ladies, knights and civilians of Plort, I don’t know even half of you half as good as I should, and I don’t like half of you even half as much as you probably deserve – nah, wrong canon.&quot;<br><br>Hieronymus the hermit stood on the highest top of the Auriantym Chain, practising the address he hoped to get away with never actually delivering. He didn’t quite remember how he had gotten there. This was probably the price he had to pay for delving into magic, bartering the ability to stay in one place – and visible – over an extended period of time for the ability to travel instantly to any place he wanted to visit, and go unnoticed until he revealed his presence.<br><br>Last he knew, he had been at Los Taelis, thinking about some constructive details of the Halley-Talia-Barracks and the Echo-Kat-Shooting-Range. There they got onto him – about a dozen knights and barons with an odd civilian in the mix. He didn’t stand a chance, and his boss didn’t help at all. Might she even have been part of that conspiracy, sending him to Los Taelis in the first place? <i>Nah</i>, he thought, <i>that’s paranoid. Mylady Neshomeh has always been benevolent.</i><br><br>So now he was a baron, looking over the land that had been thrust into his hands, and strange thoughts whirled through his mind. Far to the east, beyond the fructuous fields and lush meadows of the Riding of Sittorese, a dark line loomed above the horizon – the edge of the Kar&#39;eer Forest.  <i>I thought I had that left behind. For Kanun’s sake, I’m retired! If Baroness Juliette wants to keep the Southeast of the Riding, she can have it.</i><br><br>(to be continued)<br><hr>
<br>In other words:<br><br>The Sozeri may be a natural border, but Juliette absolutely deserves a part in the Riding of Sittorese. Just draw a line from the forest’s western corner (is that river the Meibot or a southern tributary?) southward to the coast, and we are good. (We may need to name the bay or cape where that line ends, but I’m not good at that. Is that grey line there the Coastal Ridge, and does it end where I expect the border to be?)<br><br>I didn’t notice any gulleys, crags, pine trees and wild dogs in the Riding of Sittorese (the crows though, the crows!), but then I never visited the north-eastern region that was still a part of Iric when the Riding was designed to be Plort’s breadbasket. Baron Larf may be up for a surprise when he wanders closer to his western border.<br><br>I’m too tired to finish this today, and I’m not sure yet whether it is Part 1 of the New Tales.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Much nearer than the distant forest, a flock of huts and sheds huddled against the landward slope of the Coastal Ridge (which may deserve a better name) – the rural village of Reewryght.  <i>Does this compel me to rewrite the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies to make it canon? If I ever find a way to make it goodfic while keeping it funny...</i><br><br>Even closer to where the hermit stood, the market town of Koewryght bustled with life. <i>Someday I must visit this place. But not yet; right now I like my solitude.</i><br><br>The hermit turned to the left, his gaze sweeping over the border rivers Meibot and Jid&#39;ryv – Barony Larf J. Stockins, Barony Eshakar and Barony Huinesoron, <i>a good neighbourhood</i> – and the Auksidentym Chain, until it rested on the wide dale between the two branches of the Raeltym Mountains. He still didn’t feel fully at ease with taking this away from his Master. But then, Castle Fanvik, except for the Whirl, had only just been a museum for so many years now, and somehow, the Fanvik Whirl had always been Baron Huinesoron’s domain. Which brought another thought to mind: <i>After three years of apprenticeship, the time may come when I have to be a journeyman, and this not involving an actual journey may suit an old man quite well.</i><br><br><i>Ach, we’ll see what comes from this</i>. Hieronymus rammed the staff that doubled as a flagpole into a crevice and began to gather stones and rubble. After several minutes, he stopped to wipe the sweat off his brow, glanced over the small square he had outlined on a somewhat smooth piece of rock, and started to do some calculations. Somehow, rigging up that shelter in Fanvik-Neht had been much easier. Building the Scowler’s Hermitage would take a lot of time. <br><hr>
<br>In other words:<br><br>Prepare for the <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2016/06c.html#post-138160">octogonal snowflake</a>.<br><br>Did I mention that I would like Agent Androia to get some experience before she meets Agent Hieronymus, but don’t want to invent some more agents for that? The problem there is that Androia’s internship must have happened <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2016/01c.html#post-147213">in or before January 2016</a>; I may need to take the traditional <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Luxury"> option B</a>.<br><br>@foreigners who may not know: In the ancient German/European tradition that is not followed much anymore, being a journeyman <b>does</b> involve an actual journey, working for several employers over several years. It’s the pre-internet way of innovations going viral: journeymen learn what they couldn’t learn on their apprenticeship or previous employments while they also teach what may not yet been known at their current place of employment.<br>@Huinesoron: If you find a more reliable site for the Fanvik Whirl, but it’s all just too much work, and you trust me with the keys, I’m here to help and earn me a new title.<br>@Neshomeh: If Huinesoron takes up that offer, Hieronymous the journeyman will skip the part where he should keep a distance of at least three days walking from the place of his apprenticeship. Since he doesn’t intend to ever claim mastery, breaking the rule can’t be held against him.<br><br>In case you are acquainted with Isaac Asimov’s <i>Foundation</i> series, you may remember that “scowler” is the Hamish word for “scholar”.<br><br>I can’t say that these tales write themselves, but I’m amazed how well this all fits. Apparently the Edict of Bast can read my mind.<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll try to be more explicit.  What I was trying to get across with my post is that I felt that it would be redundant to make me a PG, considering all the existing ones, including the two new ones, are guaranteed to be better than me.  I only would have been willing to accept the nomination if there was a need to balance out the workload for the existing PGs.  Considering Huinesoron <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=315193;search_term=requests">pointed out</a> that we haven&#39;t had any permission requests yet this <i>year</i>, I don&#39;t feel that is the case.<br><br>So unless someone can present an argument to me that shows we are in major need of one more warm body to serve  as PG, I am indeed <b>declining</b> the hat.<br><br>—doctorlit hates wearing hats in real life, too</p>

            <p>Dax and Lorson have a funny banter dynamic going, and their clashing personalities (and Lorson&#39;s utter newbieness) led to some good lines throughout (&quot;Doctor what&quot; and the Dex score scene are standing out to me right now for some reason).<br><br>And then the ending happened, and ... hoo boy, I wonder what Lorson&#39;s in for in the inevitable followup interlude.

            <p>Dax&#39;s character sheet—Dex score and all—are going to be referenced pretty heavily at least a few times. I like to imagine Medical has a copy of his stats as part of his records. No guesses as to where his Charisma score is sitting at... :P<br><br>They&#39;re definitely going to have to talk some stuff out.

            <p>Ah, this was a nice, calm mission.  A good example of a more experienced character leading a newer one through the ropes, and letting them learn about missions first-hand.  I&#39;m amused by Lorson learning to read the Words by adjusting the settings of his prosthetic eye.<br><br>And that nice, calm set-up sure gets ended with a bang.  I did not see that coming at all.  On Lorson&#39;s side, it shows both the level of confidence he felt when operating in his previous role as a part of the <i>Star Wars</i> canon, and the fact that those experiences really didn&#39;t prepare him for PPC missions at all.  On Dax&#39;s end, I like that he broke from his usual lighthearted, flirty tone to display to Lorson how serious his actions were.  It&#39;s fun because it shows that the serious agent of the pair has a careless side, while the easygoing one has a duteous side.<br><br>—doctorlit knew nothing about Padmé&#39;s family before now</p>

            <p>The eye adjustment was actually one of the later additions to the mission! Before I was just going to have Lorson do the usual eyes go out of focus deal, but I like him fiddling with his eye a lot more. If he&#39;s ever without it, though, he&#39;s prooobably gonna have a hard time. :P<br><br>I&#39;m glad the end did what I wanted do, showcasing that there&#39;s a bit more dimension to these two than &quot;flirty&quot; and &quot;cranky&quot;. Lorson&#39;s definitely rather reckless, especially compared to Dax. He&#39;s not used to operating by rules like this, and rules are made to be broken anyway, right?<br><br>(I knew nothing about Padmé&#39;s family before this, too, so yay for Wiki research. Seriously, how do you get the names right but the genders mixed up? I ask you...)</p>

            <p>Lorson&#39;s used to a &#39;shoot first and ask questions later&#39; approach and he&#39;s just a wee bit ticked at having to do this silly charge list nonsense.

            <p>Nick.com has most of the show available to watch for free. Each episode is only 11 minutes, and this fandom could use some help.</p>

            <p>Nobody gets into a show just to spork some fic that someone else wants sporked. It&#39;s clear that this show interests <i>you</i>, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to interest anyone else.<br><br>Maybe if you told us a little bit about it, and why you love it, and showed some emotional enthusiasm for it?<br><br>But that&#39;s no guarantee.

            <p>I love how the show is a throwback to all those 90&#39;s Nicktoons, and especially love the animation, which is inspired by comic strips of years past. Another thing I love is the characters.</p>

            <p>It always helps to have more than the title when someone&#39;s trying to rec you a new thing and get you excited and curious enough to want to watch it.<br><br>What kind of plotlines do the episodes have? Is the show fantasy, or fiction? What do you think is the best episode, or the most interesting one to watch if you want to get a taste of the show to see if you&#39;ll like it?<br><br>A single episode can easily provide a gateway into a new show: I got into Supernatural after my friend told me excitedly about a new (at the time) episode called &quot;The French Mistake&quot;, in which the main characters got sent into an alternate reality where their lives were a TV show, and the entire cast basically just poked fun at themselves and it was hilarious. (It&#39;s in season 6, if anyone&#39;s curious.) That hit my love of AUs and meta, and so I went home and watched first that and then another handful of episodes that looked especially interesting...and then I just went and started from the beginning. I stuck with that show for a good...nine seasons, I think? Maybe ten? I&#39;ve fallen out of it over the past few years, but that&#39;s not the point.<br><br>The point is that if you can get someone excited about a book, or a show, or a soundtrack, or a movie, or a group...that&#39;s what will make them more likely to check it out. They need to catch some of your excitement. That won&#39;t always work, obviously--outside of time constraints and so on, people won&#39;t necessarily share your taste enough to get excited to begin with--but if you tell them a bit more than the title (say, the show&#39;s premise, particular actors, characters or plot premises you think they&#39;ll love, the things Neshomeh mentioned), there&#39;s more of a chance they&#39;ll get into it.<br><br>~Z, with apologies for any uncaught typos. Autocorrect is an interesting thing.</p>

            <p>The show itself is slice of life. I&#39;d recommend starting with S1E1 Left in the Dark. It provides a nice introduction to the characters, especially Lincoln Loud, the only boy among 10 sisters.</p>
