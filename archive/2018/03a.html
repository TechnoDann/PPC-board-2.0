            <p>I forgot to post on my actual Boardiversary, February 1st, and only remembered yesterday. But, anyway, I&#39;ve been here for a year! Which is... just crazy. I still feel like a newbie. <br><br>Thanks for doing so much for me, PPC, even though I haven&#39;t really done much in return as far as community goes. I&#39;ve learned quite a few life lessons, made some very dear friends, and this place has helped me through some hard times. I do hope I&#39;ve matured since my introduction post, though (seriously, it was really embarrassing and I blush just thinking about it).<br><br>Also, I&#39;m changing my name to AC. Everyone calls me that on the Discord already, and... well, my original one is pretty dumb and narcissistic.</p>

            <p>Happy March, everyone! This day means a few things to me, but the only one presently relevant (subject to change) is that this marks me being able to make this.<br><br>Shipfest Sign-Ups!<br><br>For anyone who wasn&#39;t here last year, this is the thread where you opt-in for being shipped (and if you do not want to be shipped and are worried about it happening anyways, you&#39;ll be happy to know about that) and post your desired ships, the ones that do not include yourself unless you&#39;ve talked it over with the other member/members of said ship - otherwise, it could be Pretty Creepy(tm) - and definitely any limits you have on being shipped, such as &quot;not with men/women&quot; or &quot;not this particular thing&quot; or &quot;use THESE pronouns&quot;. You&#39;re also welcome to add suggestions, like saying you get stressed a lot so there&#39;s plenty of potential for Hurt/Comfort.<br>It would also be really, really handy to provide an actual description of yourself.<br><br>Cheers, all!</p>

            <p>Goodness me! Alrighty! I&#39;m in and shippable--although I&#39;ve been so silent for the past few months, I don&#39;t think any of our newbies have even encountered me. Hello to anyone I haven&#39;t met yet! No slash or genderbending for me, and please keep it SFA. For any newbies that (for some reason?) want to ship me and haven&#39;t encountered that term, SFA is SFW, but more so. Basically, keep it PG, please ^_^ <br><br>As for the description, I&#39;m female, average height, with dirty blonde hair that sometimes likes to be brown and sometimes likes to be a weird sort of reddish-brown. It curls a bit when it feels kind and gets weird waves when it feels grumpy. I have dark brown eyes, and fairly dark eyebrows that I like to call female-Gandalf brows (cf. the description of Gandalf in the Hobbit).<br><br>Also, I&#39;m not quite buff like Agent Alleb (yet) but I&#39;m actually starting to get a bit of definition in my arms! Yay for working out! <br><br>I don&#39;t have any ships yet. Gotta get back in the shipping mindset; we&#39;ll see what I come up with later on. <br><br>Also, Larfen, I think I still owe you payback for that me/Marty Robbins fic last year. It&#39;s on.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>You can also contribute ships (and stories!) even if you have opted out, if you want to. None of this is even *remotely* mandatory, and opting out of one part doesn&#39;t prevent you from joining in on other ways if you want to. Like the badfic games, this is meant to be purely for fun.

            <p>I also play stupid dress-up games for girls because of that same urge to have a little masochistic-but-actually-harmless fun.<br><br>So... my entry. I&#39;d probably have to reveal my age to do that, but well, the fact that I&#39;m cautious about revealing my age definitely does say something about my age. SFW, please, and if there is a such thing as SFW BDSM or SFW romantic role-playing, no on the first and sure on the second. I&#39;m female, very very white (as far as I know, none of my heritage is non-white, but having heard that most people have at least a little, I think there might be some. I don&#39;t know.) I&#39;m straight, but you can ship me with women or do gender-bending for extra shipping masochism.<br><br>Okay, further details on the appearance. Short wavy brown hair, hazel eyes, skinny. Signature outfit in drawings of myself is a black jacket over a red high-neck shirt, dark gray pants, and gray shoes or boots depending on how edgy I&#39;m feeling. I&#39;m easily flustered, especially with all the NSFW thoughts I&#39;ve had lately. I get really bad ideas when I&#39;m tired, but then I get really freaked out if I make a mistake (as hS knows). Feel free to rescue me from evil ghosts/demons/kings/mechsuited dictators/etc.<br><br>I don&#39;t have any ships to offer. I really don&#39;t ship real-life people unless there&#39;s been some sort of funny build-up to it (e.g. my friend agreed with me that Kylo Ren is hot and then was like &quot;OH SHOOT I SAID THAT OUT LOUD&quot; so I ship that.) I&#39;ll have to see what happens here, and I might jump on the bandwagon for another ship.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

If you&#39;ve been in a voice chat with the two of them, you know what&#39;s up.<br>- Granz/Thoth. Since all the other permutations of Cal, Granz, and Thoth have been suggested, and this one&#39;s somewhat more plausible. <br>- ... Cal/Granz/Thoth, because decisions are hard.<br>- Delta/Ix, because of all the RP they were doing in the Discord before Ix left the chat.<br>- doctorlit/Skarmory. One&#39;s a zookeeper, the other&#39;s an intelligent bird, you do the math.<br>- If he shows up, Katlyn/Avarice - oldest Boarder/newest Boarder<br>- hS/Katlyn/Novastorme/... - Britship. Featuring copious amount of tea and creative uses for scones.<br>- Guardsman Tom/Akrinor/Hardic/... - Euroship.<br>- (Commander) Horvat/Guardsman Tom - Sure, that&#39;s BLAMworthy in the Guard, but when did that stop anyone?<br>- Phobos/Thoth/[people I can&#39;t remember] - Surely someone can turn a game of MtG into shipping?<br>and finally<br>- Thoth/parentheses - He&#39;s a LISPer, this should be obvious.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Granz, Thoth, and I legitimately spend hours each day cuddling one another. If ships involving us don&#39;t also involve cuddles, snuggles, nuzzles, huggles, the booping of snoots, or some combination of the above - at least a little - they are wildly inaccurate and will be deemed heresy.<br><br>(That or kissing one another on the forehead.

            <p>I don&#39;t think there is a reg stating that you can&#39;t have a relationship witha a subbordinate, but you would still face repercussions as the commisar or someone above you would likely have an issue with it. Also, while there isn&#39;t (so far as I am aware) a regulation against a formentioned relationships, it is probably implied in some other reg that jt isn&#39;t okaya.</p>

            <p>So, yes, I am in and super excited for this. Let&#39;s get this description rolling!<br><br>I&#39;m around five-foot-eight (not short, dang it) with somewhat-wavy hair to my shoulderblades, which actually stick out a little bit, fun fact. Pretty pale skin, seeing as I never go outside if I can help it, plus eyes that are <i>usually</i> hazel-green, though sometimes they shift to hazel-brown. I have no idea why. Given that I&#39;m about ten pounds under at last check, I can safely say I&#39;m Kind Of A Twig.<br>As for clothes, jeans, tee, and unseasonally warm coat, plus a pair of purple glasses. It&#39;s possibly worth noting that I have no idea why everyone else thinks heels are hard to walk in because three-inch stiletto boots are easy as pie to me, though I do sneakers for everyday shenanigans.<br>For an alternate appearance, add in cat ears and tail, because being a cat is fun.<br><br>As for shipping limitations: no bloodplay, no shipping me with my brother Lore, and for the love of the gods no shipping me with a bloody weather pattern. But fruits and fursuits are totally fine.<br><br>And, of course... ships. All the ships. <i>manic grinning</i> I&#39;ll have to add those in a bit later, but they are coming, mark my words.<br><br>(I&#39;m looking at you, Team Prospit. Be prepared.)</p>

            <p>My poor friends. I do not have <i>All</i> The Ships, but I do have a few here.<br><br>Let me start this off with one that might seem slightly... <i>odd</i> to anyone that wasn&#39;t here for all of this: <b>The Party,</b> being Thoth, Granz, myself, and Mikel. We talked the proposal of this ship over before, don&#39;t worry. All of us got fairly close during this four-month-long roleplay (and yes, it really did take that long), in a lot of different ways. And, of course, this is to be divided into two sub-ships, only one of which I will hereby propose: <b>Team Prospit,</b> being Thoth and Granz. Because gods above have you heard these two ever? I&#39;m serious, they are the cutest bloody thing.<br><br>Beyond that, I heartily recommend:<br><b>Granz/Every rulebook in existence</b> because seriously, child, you have an Obsession;<br><b>Thoth/Code/Tomash</b> what with how much they discuss it;<br><b>Horvat/Military Fortifications</b> because he is fortifying this position;<br>And, of course, anything else I think of in about ten seconds. Because gods only know there will be more.</p>

            <p>A&#39;right. 18 year old white male with some stubble,shortish brown hair, brown eyes with a hint of grey to em. Tall, somewhat stocky. Red scar on back of left hand. Wears glasses with rectangular lenses. Favors khaki cargo pants and t-shirts, occasionally a grey polo shirt if I feel like being more formal. Male pronouns, heterosexual as far as I know, though I don&#39;t mind strictly platonic cuddling with others regardless of gender. Assuming I know them well enough.<br>Don&#39;t ship me with Thoth, or Horvat, or Avarice please. And if you want an alternate appearance/avatar to represent me, just use a generic mail-armored dwarf with axe and shield. Or a Dark Angels Company Master from 40k. That&#39;s all I think.

            <p>It&#39;s pretty hard (or impossible?) to search the Board archives in the Board for usernames, but searching &#39;Ninny&#39; got me to some mentions back in March and April of 2017. That does give at least a little context, though--I don&#39;t remember that screen name very well, but I do remember seeing it. Bassman or Bass man is completely unfamiliar, I&#39;m afraid.<br><br>Generally, it&#39;s helpful to have only one PPC screen name, even if you&#39;re on both the Board and the Discord--it really, really helps eliminate confusion.

            <p>You as well? Maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been inactive the past few months. Need to fix that. The reason I was interested was because of story writing.

            <p>We&#39;re not going to stop talking about the thing this Board exists to talk about. {= )<br><br>Mostly what we talk about is our own spin-offs and characters, though, I think.

            <p>Honestly, this is the best place I have in terms of an active writing community. Others I&#39;ve been to are too toxic, inactive, or just plain uninteresting to follow. I even think there was a group that only had one admin and a bunch of sock puppet accounts. I know the basic premise of the PPC, and I would love to follow it. But I can&#39;t do it right now. Like I said before, I&#39;m having trouble just catching up on them, let alone dig through the wikia in search of plot points and references.<br><br>I feel like an attention whore right now.

            <p>There&#39;s a really cool thing that&#39;s been going on the last few months, which is that every two weeks on a Thursday, Novastorme posts a writing prompt, and whoever feels like it responds with a short scene. (I&#39;ve been hitting about 1.5-2 pages, nothing huge; nothing I can&#39;t bang out in a couple of hours, and I&#39;m slow.) It doesn&#39;t <i>have</i> to be about the PPC (Nova has made a point of making the prompts open enough for any setting), it&#39;s pretty informal, and it&#39;s a great way to develop characters and get some feedback. I&#39;d recommend jumping in there.<br><br>It is polite to comment on other people&#39;s prompt pieces, especially if they comment on yours, but you shouldn&#39;t have to read any missions or backstories to be able to follow little one-shot character vignettes. Not saying it wouldn&#39;t help, of course, but it shouldn&#39;t be <i>necessary</i>. And hey, maybe reading some very short works will introduce you to some characters you like enough to follow in their spin-off, and you can get to know the PPC better that way. Each spin-off is pretty self-contained, so there&#39;s really no wrong place to start. There&#39;s a saying in comics: &quot;Every issue is someone&#39;s first.&quot; I figure that can go for PPC stories, too.<br><br>If even that seems like too much, I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. I don&#39;t know what in your life is holding you back, but like anything else, you&#39;re only going to get out of the PPC community what you&#39;re willing and able to put into it. At some point, you gotta make an effort.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

That&#39;s part of why I&#39;ve been so active on the prompts threads; they&#39;re short enough that I can get them finished before my brain starts screaming at me about how useless the story is.<br><br>Thank you for the kind words, though. I appreciate it. =]</p>

            <p>Blimey, two years already. Time really does fly when you&#39;re having fun, huh?<br>And it has been fun. Really don&#39;t know where I&#39;d be without this place, there&#39;s nothing else quite like it. It&#39;s irreverent, heartfelt, comical and comforting all at once, and full to bursting with the best people I&#39;ve ever met. It&#39;s a joy to be around, and the only place on the Internet I&#39;ve ever really felt at home. <br><br>So, here&#39;s to another wonderful year, and to the best place on the Internet, and all you wonderful people who make it so. Thanks for being awesome, everyone. </p>

            <p>I realize this probably isn&#39;t going to see any discussion, since I seem to be the only one here who likes King&#39;s really dark stuff.  But I intend to write a review of every piece of canon media I consume from now on, and forwards I must march.<br><br>Spoilers for <i>It</i> in addition to <i>The Tommyknockers</i>.<br><br>I think this is the darkest King novel I&#39;ve read so far (though I suppose the novella <i>Apt Pupil</i> is still probably the darkest, since all the evil there comes out of human failings).  Up to this point, I had read <i>The Shining</i>, <i>It</i> and <i>From a Buick 8</i>.  All of those, despite the horror elements and actual murders, still had the classic setup of heroic characters poised against the villains.  There was always the sense that as long as the good guys banded together and tried their desperate hardest, there was at least a chance they could overcome the supernatural adversaries they were pitted against.<br><br>Not so in <i>The Tommyknockers</i>.  I found myself legitimately wondering midway through the story whether there could be any real resolution at all.  I didn&#39;t delude myself that the Haven townsfolk who had started being converted into alien beings, with their human minds and morals being overwritten, could ever be restored to their natural selves.  The line-up of protagonists got progressively grimmer and less promising as the novel progressed: the town constable, being transformed herself and fighting it off through sheer force of will, until finally blowing herself up in a desperate attempt to warn the outside world of what was happening in Haven; an old man, immune to the electromagnetism transforming the rest of the town thanks to a metal plate in his head, who tries to bring a policeman from Derry to prove to the outside world what&#39;s happening, but the air is too toxic for the policeman by that point, and he is killed and the old man captured; and finally and least promising, Gardener, the drunk who was actually introduced at the beginning of the novel, and who, despite being immune thanks to also a plate in his head, goes along with the Tommyknockers because he wants to use the alien technology to free the world from nuclear power.  To Gardener&#39;s credit, he at least manages to hijack the saucer at the end and strand the Tommyknockers on Earth, but the fact that it takes nearly the whole novel for him to wise up and realize how dangerous the aliens and their technology is is frustrating.  Especially since he&#39;s partly responsible for foiling the old man&#39;s plans, and since part of his realization came from the constable blowing herself up.  I have to wonder how things might have gone differently if Gardener had managed to work with the other protagonists earlier on, if maybe some of the town could have been prevented from transforming into full Tommyknocker, if only Gardener had stopped getting drunk literally the whole novel.  The whole situation just felt incredibly hopeless for most of the read.<br><br>It&#39;s interesting how King took a plot that sounds like it should be science fiction (a crashed flying saucer is exposed and starts turning the town into aliens), and writes it very much as a horror novel.  It&#39;s the transformation of both the Havenites&#39;s bodies and minds that do it.  The physical changes are bad enough, but it&#39;s the mental changes that really horrify.  The people in the town, despite their new telepathy and ability to invent amazing machines, almost become childlike in their unquestioning devotion to excavating the saucer.  As the human parts of their brains get dominated more and more by Tommyknocker-minds, their ability to question their own actions vanishes, and they are driven fully by the impulses planted in their minds to keep outsiders away, to get the ship out of the ground, to keep inventing dangerous technologies.  And where most alien species in sci-fi stories are defined by cultural development, the history of their species, and the character traits of individuals, the final revelation of the mysterious Tommyknockers is that they lack culture, individual identities, and even history, since they seem to propagate themselves through the mechanism of their ships transforming other sentient species into copies of themselves.  It&#39;s strongly hinted that the development of technologies gives them an overwhelming rush of euphoria from some endorphin-like molecule, and this addictive drive to create things has driven their species to pursue that, and only that, at the cost of any moral ability to question the risks that technology poses, and any ability to respect other members of their species as autonomous creatures‚Äîinstead, the Tommyknockers seem to inevitably end up using their own people as living batteries.  Heck, they don&#39;t even have a <i>name</i> for themselves; they had to borrow that from reading the Tommyknocker nursery rhyme from Gardener&#39;s mind.  Things like that don&#39;t matter to them.  They are invention junkies, and they always need another fix.<br><br>There are actually a fair number of inconsistencies in the middle of the novel.  Different people seem to transform at strangely arbitrary rates.  The &quot;shed people&quot; who expose themselves to a Tommyknocker computer in Bobbi Anderson&#39;s shed are supposed to change at a much faster rate than anyone else in town.  Indeed, they are the only ones who are wholly and physically Tommyknockers at the novels end.  But throughout the novel, other people seem to completely lose the humanity in their minds before others; in particular, Bobbi herself still has to fight against her feelings for Gardener right up until the very final days before she tries to kill him.  It seems like Bobbi should have lost her human mind the fastest, since she was the one who tripped over the ship in the first place and was exposed the longest.  That said, this novel had me <i>hooked</i>.  I mean, I&#39;m a book nerd, but I rarely feel so desperate to find out how a story unfolds that I have to stop myself from flipping ahead through sheer will power, but I had to fight that urge this time around.  Just very intriguing, suspenseful writing all throughout.<br><br>Pennywise makes a couple of cameos in this novel, Derry being just a couple towns away from Haven.  <i>The Tommyknockers</i> was written only a year after <i>It</i>, and takes place only two years after.  It&#39;s actually kind of frustrating that he brought Pennywise back so soon after; it feels like it ruins the Loser&#39;s Club&#39;s triumph at the end of <i>It</i>, which really felt like a final victory, considering how much Derry got destroyed during that final confrontation.  I suppose it&#39;s possible that did successfully kill the Pennywise they were facing, and that the new one is one of Its/Her eggs that they failed to find and crush.  It still feels kind of disappointing.  It was, however, kind of amusing for Pennywise to metaphorically take the Tommyknockers down a peg.  The teen who saw him had transformed so much by that point that he didn&#39;t even make it back to Haven alive, as his body could no longer survive in Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  Surely the human parts of his brain/mind were fully gone by then, yet Pennywise still tried to feed on him.  I guess Pennywise&#39;s powers trump the Tommyknockers!<br><br>Bobbi was an author of Westerns before encountering the flying saucer.  She wrote her last novel while she still had human parts to her mind, but then promptly stopped caring about her writing, and never tried to get it published.  That means that I have an unexpected mission to perform, in the name of a certain New Caledonian Museum . . .<br><br>. . . Which will have to wait until my next spot of free time, because I need to leave for work now.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit, eager to see the lengths Sues must go to in order to invade this story<br><br>If you haven&#39;t read, then don&#39;t you dare look!

            <p>Or a title very similar to that.  It wouldn&#39;t all fit.  Spoilers for pretty much the entire <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> series.  I‚Äôm specifically looking at <i>Kingdom Hearts œá Back Cover</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-</i>.  <i>Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</i> was also included on the disc, but I had previously played that on 3DS.<br><br><b>Kingdom Hearts œá Back Cover</b><br>This is a movie detailing the very earliest parts of the KH timeline.  I hadn‚Äôt played the mobile phone game it was based on, so it was wholly new information to me.<br><br>At the outset of the film, the main focus for me was gleaning what info I could about the details the Master of Masters had left his six apprentices.  I was put pretty quickly ill at ease by the slightly manic and aloof mannerisms of the Master‚Äîhis voice actor did an incredible job of toeing the line between clearly lying scheming and  questionably real goofiness‚Äîand by the suspicions that were quickly piling up between the five active apprentices.  For a while, I did get suckered into thinking that one of them was a traitor‚ÄîI was suspecting either Jaguar Mask Boy What Investigates Mysteries or Unicorn Mask Man What Is the Leader‚Äîbut at the point it finally revealed that the info Jaguar Mask had was not taken by him to hide his own treachery, but had been given to him by the Master to ferret out treachery, that I really figured out what was going on.  The Master had set them all up to be suspicious of each other.  Not only did he suspect that the prophesied Keyblade War couldn‚Äôt be prevented, as he had said at the beginning of the movie, but he was actively trying to cause it.<br><br>As riveting as it was up to that point, things got even more ridiculous with the final scene.  I had been questioning how the Master had gotten a book that foretold the entire future.  The fact that it told of the Keyblade War gave it at least some credence, since we know that event took place in KH history.  But the revelation that the Master himself wrote it turns everything on its head, because now we‚Äôre dealing with an in-universe unreliable narrator: either the foretold traitor incident was made up wholesale to sow distrust among his apprentices, or he was simply writing of <i>his own betrayal of them</i> at the point in history when it would actually manifest consequences.  The fact that the eye symbol we‚Äôve been seeing on various weapons throughout the entire series has actually been an augury to spy on the future all along was a little shocking, as it had seemed like nothing but a decorative motif up to this point.  It also, however, makes me question where the writers are actually going with this.  What‚Äôs the implication, if any, that someone who presumably died over nine hundred years in the past has been spying on the events of the rest of the series?  Is it simply to confirm that the ‚Äúseven lights vs. thirteen darknesses‚Äù prophecy has merit?  Is the Master going to have some influence on <i>Kingdom Hearts III</i>, despite having lived a thousand years previous?  Are they setting up a future plot line, since KH3 is said to be the end of the ‚ÄúXehanort saga,‚Äù but not the end of the series as a whole?<br><br>Despite all the questions it opens up, it was a good movie.  Using the animal masks was smart, as it makes it a lot easier to keep track of the characters, and they all had stupid, stupid names.  The voice actors were all good choices who suited their roles well.<br><br><b>Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-</b><br>Aqua is one of my favorite characters in the series, so getting a solo adventure to herself, even if it wasn‚Äôt quite a full-length game, is most excellent.  I‚Äôm amused by the fact that it starts her out at level 50, reflecting all her experiences in her original game.  Due to the (mostly) lack of other actual characters in the Realm of Darkness, the programmers had no humanoid villains to use as enemies (other than Aqua‚Äôs own reflection in the Magic Mirror), but they did a good job of designing all the Heartless to be threatening enough to require you to stay on your toes in every fight.  Heck, even the familiar Darkside boss, from the original KH, gets quite a bit of presence as they lurk in the background of the Enchanted Dominion area.  And I never would have guessed that throwing a bunch of basic Shadows into a pile and calling it a boss would be very threatening, but man, that final boss was <i>thrilling</i> as heck.<br><br>And few characters also means few allies to converse with, but the writers and Aqua‚Äôs voice actor did a good job of expressing her slow descent into hopelessness through the infrequent moments when Aqua speaks or thinks to herself.  It‚Äôs also heartbreaking when she finally meets Mickey near the end of the game, and learns she‚Äôs been trapped in the Realm for nearly a decade.  While her despair throughout the game was realistic in her circumstances, it felt really good for her older confidence and drive to come back at the end.  I also like, though, that the incident with her reflection made her realize that her heart was vulnerable to darkness as well.  Aqua had some moral absoluteness issues in her original appearance (willing to attack Cinderella‚Äôs wicked stepfamily, for example), and it implied that she was unable to sense the darkness-to-light ratio in people she had spent a lot of time and around and was used to, presumably including herself.  I‚Äôve always, therefore, assumed that Aqua assumed she had a heart of pure light, even though canonically that‚Äôs only possible for Ventus and the Princesses of Heart.  So I do think it‚Äôs important for her character going forward that she recognized even her heart had aspects that the forces of darkness could overpower.<br><br>I feel like I should have seen it coming earlier than I did, but it was still a very fun surprise when the plot went full <i>Rogue One</i> and bumped up against the ending of the original KH.  It‚Äôs awesome actually getting to see what Mickey was up to while he was offscreen, and awesome to get some limited control on a real Destiny Islands map once again, rather than just the Sora‚Äôs memory version or the data version.  It‚Äôs maybe a little silly in retrospect that Riku somehow didn‚Äôt notice all the commotion behind him while he was running towards the door, and I think the timing is a little off between Riku reaching the door and Mickey appearing, but whatever.  As an Aqua fan, I endorse retconning things to let her have a hand in the initial game‚Äôs victory.<br><br>And I am very excited for KH3 now, and can‚Äôt wait to see how this initial storyline gets tied up.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit 4D: sequel prequel midquel sidequel ~~Poetic Emotional Metaphor in Nongrammatical Punctuation~~ HD Cinematic: Electric Boogaloo Z: The Rebootening<br><br>&quot;Only your heart is hollow enough to be a spoiler.&quot;  &quot;Only your heart is hollow enough to be a spoiler.&quot;  &quot;Only your heart is hollow enough to be a spoiler.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Author&#39;s Note: This kept getting longer and longer.  I think I may eventually expand this into a longer interlude, but for now, I just want to post what I have.  I&#39;m falling disastrously far behind on free time stuff this week.  Unbetad.<br><br>&quot;Coming Knocking&quot;
<br>As Jim Gardener was entering the shed outside to talk to the living batteries imprisoned there, a thin blue portal opened in Bobbi Anderson&#39;s kitchen.  Agent Doc slid through quickly, his hand already on the button to punch it closed once he was through.  For safety&#39;s sake, he had first portaled to one of the dead worlds touched by Orannis in the Old Kingdom universe before coming here.  He would go through a different one on the back to HQ.  Those planets no longer had any atmosphere; the electromagnetic particles that slipped through the portals would disperse harmlessly into the vaccuum, and only a very insignificant number of the molecules would follow him back home.<br><br>Hopefully.  The fewer the better.<br><br>Doc had set the portal into the kitchen to be as far away from Gardener as he could be, just in case he had noticed the flash of blue.  This was no fanfiction; Doc was now right in the canon setting, and there was no room to screw up, no option of letting events be disrupted.<br><br>The drawback to starting in the kitchen, however, was that Doc got a much too close-up view of the body that had once belonged to Bobbi Anderson.  The body, burned and bloody thanks to Jim Gardener‚Äôs actions not long before, that clearly hadn&#39;t been human for quite some time now.<br><br>Reading King&#39;s descriptions of a Tommyknocker didn&#39;t do any justice to seeing one in the translucent flesh.  Doc gasped, but then mentally reprimanded himself for doing so.  The oxygen tank strapped around his back wouldn&#39;t last forever, and he had needed it before even getting here, in the airless world destroyed by Orannis.  Doc hurried around the body and out of the kitchen.<br><br>In Bobbi&#39;s living room, Doc forced himself to ignore the various machines and gadgets Bobbi had installed under the influence of the Tommyknocker-mind that had invaded hers.  Despite being cobbled together from batteries and eighties technology, their undeniably futuristic nature made for a weird contrast with the homey wooden construction of the living room, and its worn-out couch.<br><br>It was the desk against one wall that Doc sought.  What looked like an old-fashioned typewriter sat there; it only looked that way, because anyone with a Tommyknocker&#39;s telepathy could run it without touching the keys.  How far away had Bobbi said she could still use it?  Five miles?<br><br>But thinking of that distance reminded Doc of the other time limit he had to keep in mind.  Long before his oxygen ran out, nearly every Tommyknocker in Haven would be bearing down on this farm, having felt Bobbi&#39;s psychic screaming when Gard murdered her.  Not long after, this house would be going up in flames.  And that was why he had come, to rescue . . .<br><br>There.  Next to the typewriter.  <i>The Buffalo Soldiers</i>.  Bobbi Anderson&#39;s final novel, written while she piloted a levitating piece of construction equipment in the forest behind her house, excavating a flying saucer.<br><br>The unpublished<br><i>unbetad</i><br>manuscript sat there, a stack of computer paper almost as thick as Doc&#39;s palms.  He picked up the pile and carefully wedged it under his arm.  He was terrified of the prospect of even one precious page slipping out of his grip, but he wanted the manuscript already in his hands when he opened the portal.  The fewer molecules of this polluted air that followed him through, the better.<br><br>Which is why he was so distracted by the two sounds that started as he got the pages firmly and lovingly nestled into the crook of his arm.  One was a sputtering old truck engine.  Freeman Moss, the first of the former humans-turned Tommyknocker who would come to attack Gardener, had already arrived, much faster than Doc had expected.  The fire would be catching soon.<br><br>The second was a female voice in Doc&#39;s head that said, <i>Honestly, I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s worth saving.</i><br><br>Doc froze in place, and felt a chill creep up and down his spine.  He thought of all the things that might have gone wrong.<br><br><i>A leak in the air pack somewhere I&#39;ve been breathing the air this whole time and now I&#39;m &quot;becoming&quot; one of them I can never go back to HQ now‚Äî</i><br><br><i>Hold on, there,</i> admonished the voice.  <i>It&#39;s not you, and it&#39;s not</i> them<i>, this is just me.  The old and unimproved, as Gard would say.</i><br><br>Then, Freeman Moss&#39;s mental voice interrupted, broadcasting to Gardener outside: Looks like Bobbi put at least one good one into you, you snake.  It really was close to hearing someone talk, that Tommyknocker telepathy.  Loud, and impossible to ignore.  Different from hearing an Andalite&#39;s thought-speech, and different from the thoughts of Bobbi&#39;s ghost just now.<br><br><i>A ghost?  I don&#39;t know about that, kid.  There&#39;s been a lot of weird mind stuff going on in this town lately‚Äîalthough I suspect you know all about that, somehow.  I think being psychic these last few months has let my mind last a little longer than my brain, if you can dig it.  And I&#39;ve got to tell ya, it&#39;s real good to think for</i> myself <i>again.</i><br><br>Doc mumbled around the mouthpiece of his breathing apparatus; really, he didn&#39;t know what to say.  Bobbi&#39;s ghost‚Äîor at least, what he had thought of as her ghost while he had been reading‚Äîhad indeed appeared to keep Gardener safe a couple of times right at the end of the novel, before eventually fading away.  But Doc wasn&#39;t prepared to encounter her like this.  And without a physical body, the neuralyzer Doc had brought along just in case wasn&#39;t going to accomplish anything.<br><br><i>I didn‚Äôt quite catch that.  I&#39;m not as good at reading minds as I was an hour ago, and that hick yelling at Gard out there doesn&#39;t help.  But I think I got the jist of it.  You didn&#39;t want anyone seeing you, and you think I&#39;m trouble now.  Well, don&#39;t sweat it, all right?  I have a feeling I&#39;m not going to be around much longer‚Äîwouldn&#39;t exactly want this to be a permanent set-up, anyway.  All I care about now is Gard.  But listen: that novel you got there?  That‚Äôs not mine.  I didn‚Äôt write it.  The Tommyknockers did.  The old and unimproved Bobbi Anderson never could have written anything that good, especially not in three weeks.</i><br><br>As Doc mulled over her words, a green light bloomed out in the dooryard.  The light was bright, but the green was a sick and dirty one, and Doc closed his eyes against it.  Soon after, he flinched and hugged <i>The Buffalo Soldiers</i> to his chest as Freeman Moss‚Äôs mental screams slammed into him.  Straining to focus on his words against the not-quite-a-sound, Doc concentrated on his thoughts, trying to make them as clear as possible for Bobbi.  <i>That‚Äôs bullcrap, Mrs. Anderson, and you know it!  The Tommyknocker that was in your body admitted it!  They can make things work, but they don‚Äôt understand</i> why <i>things work.  They‚Äôre only intelligent, not smart.  They ran this entire town on batteries!  You think creatures like that could write an entire novel?  They aren‚Äôt capable of creativity, Mrs. Anderson.  That was</i> you<i>.</i>  Freeman‚Äôs screams finally died down, as did the green light outside.  Doc relaxed and thought his words more calmly.  <i>It was you.  The Tommyknockers may have made the telepathic typewriter, they may have buzzed your brain to make you work yourself to death, but they couldn‚Äôt have created a story.  Only you could have done this.</i>  He held the manuscript out in both hands, displaying the thickness‚Äînot that he had any clue where Bobbi actually was, so to speak.  <i>This right here is Roberta Anderson.  And I‚Äôm here to make sure it survives this day.</i><br><br>Outside, the fuel tank of Bobbi‚Äôs truck exploded.  It wouldn‚Äôt be long now.<br><br><i>Well, all right, then.  You do whatever you want.  But . . . just make sure, if it does get published, you keep that dedication page intact.  He‚Äôs been a good friend to me.  I‚Äôm going after him now, see if I can‚Äôt still be some kind of friend to him.</i><br><br><i>You‚Äôve got it,</i> Doc said.  But somehow, he knew that whatever part of Bobbi Anderson he had speaking with was no longer there to hear it.<br><br>Next, it was Freeman‚Äôs truck‚Äôs turn to blow.  Bits of flaming debris began to drift against the front of the house, and through the open door.<br><br>Doc carefully settled the manuscript into the crook of his arm again, then he took an unexpectedly ragged breath and frowned.  <i>I wasn‚Äôt supposed to stop for a chat,</i> he thought.  <i>It was supposed to be a quick in-and-out, and they gave me just enough oxygen for that..</i><br><br>He moved away from the front door.  A couple of objects in the living room had already ignited.  His eyes focused on the RA, he very carefully and deliberately typed in the coordinates to the second of Orannis‚Äôs victims, despite his breathing growing more difficult.  There was no time for errors now.  A thin portal edged open.  He slid through and immediately closed it, cutting himself off from Haven‚Äôs polluted air for, he hoped, the last time in his PPC career.<br><br>This world looked identical to Orannis‚Äôs other victim Doc had passed through on the way to the Stephen King world.  The air back in Haven was toxic, and would have killed Doc on the spot if he had breathed much at all.  But here, there was no atmosphere at all, and the danger of the oxygen tank running out was just as real.  Still, Doc trekked across the dead world, getting as far away as he could from the spot where he had opened the portal out of Haven.  The fewer molecules of Haven air that followed him back to HQ, the better for everyone.<br><br>He marched across that rock, listening to his breathing grow more and more strained as the tank‚Äôs supply grew thin.  He already had the RA set to portal back to Medical Research‚Äôs quarantine room.  Once Doc took his first completely empty breath, he clicked it open and slid through, then closed it.  Dizziness was just beginning to cloud his mind as he yanked the breather out of his mouth.  He drew in a full and wonderful breath.<br><br>He knew the MRD scientists would already be remotely monitoring the room‚Äôs atmosphere, and Doc‚Äôs own biology, for contamination.  That was fine.  He could wait.  He had a way to pass the time.  He lay down on the generic floor and set <i>The Buffalo Soldiers</i> down, neatly patting the edges of the stack until all the papers were perfectly squared.  He turned the title page over and laid it face down next to the rest of the pile.  He then did the same with the dedication page, which read so appropriately:<br><br><i>For Gard, who‚Äôs always there when I need him.</i><br><br>* * *
<br><br>Author&#39;s Note: I hope this doesn&#39;t reek too much of &quot;PPC agent chumming it up with a canon character.&quot;  When I got the idea for this, I was expecting it to be much shorter, but I just kept uncovering more as I wrote.  Bobbi&#39;s &quot;ghost&quot; or whatever does vanish from the narrative soon after the point in time when this story takes place, so I don&#39;t think the lack of neuralyzation is an issue.  <i>The Buffalo Soldiers</i> is of course destined for la Mus√©e des Univers Perdus.  (I know it&#39;s not from a lost civilization, but it <i>is</i> lost, eh?)  The novel&#39;s dedication is taken directly from the narrative in <i>The Tommyknockers</i>.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit</p>

            <p>I mean, I was still enthralled by it.  Admittedly, from a conciseness/directness standpoint, there are a lot of vignettes in the middle section of the book that don&#39;t have direct bearing on the outcome of the novel, about random townspeople.  But I felt that helped to flesh out the setting more, and gave an idea of the scope of the changes affecting the town.  Some of the information provided from that section led me to guess some information about the Tommyknockers&#39;s nature before the reveal at the end, and I&#39;m typically bad at figuring things out on my own before a novel reveals them.  So I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much I would like to see cut out, personally.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit, watching water boil</p>

            <p>I think it partially comes down to it having been written during the cocaine phase of his career. You can notice a certain autobiographical element in some of his works of that era: doesn&#39;t his line about &quot;spurious energy&quot; sound like what the alien ship gives people?</p>

            <p>Gardener&#39;s main motivation is his fear of the health effects of nuclear power plant operation.  It&#39;s the only reason he goes along with helping the Tommyknockers‚Äîhe feels that the technologies they develop will provide a safer source of power for the world.  By the end, of course, he finally realizes that their tech can be used violently, just like human tech can, and that the Tommyknockers&#39;s original social structure got broken down through their irresponsible use of it.  Gardener constructs a rhyme about it that sums it up pretty well:<br><br>&quot;I had a perfectly good reason to raise this fuss<br>I met the Tommyknockers, and they were us.&quot;<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit</p>

            <p>Anyway, at some point in his career Stephen King was on: Valium , Cocaine, Cough Syrup (seriously), and a large amount of alcohol, to the point where he got drunk on mouthwash (Scrope, to be exact). Note the large number of alcoholics who work their way into his books. All of this is thought to the reason why he doesn&#39;t remember writing Cujo or the production of Maximum Overdrive. This is all the information I have on the subject.</p>

            <p>Last time I plugged my MTG blog it was with a deck tech, which I understand has a narrow appeal.  But this is the PPC; we are readers, writers, and watchers of things.  We like to analyze things, and look at characters in interesting ways.  To that end, I give you: <a href="https://badmoonmtg.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/color-analysis-marvels-avengers">Color Analysis - MCU Avengers</a><br><br>In this article, I look at Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Widow, and I assign them a three color combination based on their personality.  It&#39;s not only fun, it is also educational.  I use this as one method of better understanding characters that I am reading or writing about (other methods may include Space Marine Legions and classical elements).<br><br>So, please read my article and, if you are feeling it, try your hand at assigning colors to your own characters.  You can also argue your own interpretation of other peoples&#39; characters (but let the author have first crack at it, please).  I&#39;ll look at my own PPC Agents in a comment below.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Usually, when I try to apply the color pie to non-<i>Magic</i> characters, I end up going either monocolor or two-colored.  I think that&#39;s because I&#39;ve been looking more at the themes presented by such characters than trying to look at their underlying motivations.<br><br>I&#39;ll try to use your method for a few of my characters and aim for three colors, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be as analytical as you.<br><br><b>Doc</b><br>I think I can get Doc pretty well, since he&#39;s still largely me.  Primary color is absolutely white, and for a different reason than I&#39;ve seen any other character in this thread be pegged as white.  The saying goes &quot;you&#39;re either a leader or a follower,&quot; and Doc and I are followers, hands-down.  Referring to myself as a sidekick is a running gag at work, and I often go in early/stay late to do extra work, because to my mind, my time is spent better on the animals at the zoo than on myself; I am their servant.  Translating this to Doc, I feel that he sees himself as servant to all the worlds under his protection, and doesn&#39;t have as much motivation to go out into HQ and spend time on anything other researching new canons.<br><br>But of course, Doc&#39;s love of books also has an element of greed and obsession to it.  While cards themed with greed tend to be black cards in <i>Magic</i>, I feel that Doc&#39;s tendency to fly into a rage when books are threatened, coupled with the servanthood attitude from his white slice of the pie, which makes the books themselves his focus, make this attribute more red for him than black.<br><br>The tertiary color is where Doc and I diverge.  I think Doc&#39;s tertiary is green.  This mostly comes from the manner in which the both of us prefer to read: very slowly, savoring each sentence, and allowing the story to unfold itself at its own pace, rather than hurrying through and skimming.  My full time+ job sometimes forces me to forego reading the way I like, during lunch breaks and such, but Doc is able to read my original, green way.   (I think my &quot;tertiary&quot; has split into a tie between green and blue, since my job requires me to be proactive in planning and problem solving.)<br><br>So Doc is WRG.<br><br><b>Vania</b><br>Vania is probably going to be the hardest for me, if only because of the <s>spoilers</s>.  Looking at her as I picture her base state, before she was recruited to the PPC, she was very friendly and outgoing, participating in campus activities and trying to get along with everyone.  This mostly sounds white, but there&#39;s also an element of recklessness and jumping to snap decisions in her character.  I think I&#39;m going to cheat and say her primary is a relatively even split between red and white.<br><br>Tertiary is a bit hard.  Her narrative has had a small element of showing people the ropes in a new situation.  I <i>think</i> that would be blue rather than green, though I&#39;m not entirely certain.  Although I just noticed she&#39;s very near to becoming the same colors as Doc, so let&#39;s go with blue, but a very <small>small</small> blue.<br><br>Vania is WRu.<br><br><b>Paul</b><br>aka, the flashback character no one remembers or cares about.  He does exist, though, in some of PoorCynic&#39;s writing exercises, <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2013/10b.html#post-112055">here</a> and <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2013/10b.html#post-112061">here</a>, if you scroll down to &quot;2. Responding to criticism . . .&quot; in the first link.<br><br>Since he&#39;s flashback-only, and was basically just a past antagonist to Vania, I very intentionally designed Paul to be Not Nice.  That second prompt seems to show him caring for his Pok√©mon, but he&#39;s ultimately just acting that way because he thinks it will make them grow stronger, faster.  (Didn&#39;t reallt write it that well, in retrospect.)  It&#39;s the same rote, empty act as giving your Pok√©mon a haircut in the games to increase their Friendship stat by 1: it <i>represents</i> care and attention, but is really nothing more than a game mechanic.  Paul wants to make his Pok√©mon powerful, he single-minded about that goal, and he doesn&#39;t want others controlling his life.  Paul&#39;s primary color is easily black.<br><br>Even in the PPC, where he has actual, living Pok√©mon instead of game data, and can physically go to the Pok√©mon universe, Paul still looks at those things in terms of stats and numbers and strategy guides, because those are things he can know in his head, without being distracted by the open-ended randomness of the organic world.  There&#39;s no subjectivity in his charge lists, either; there&#39;s only right and wrong.  Paul is confident he knows which is which, and dictates it to the badfic accordingly.  Paul&#39;s secondary color is blue.<br><br>For tertiary, weirdly, I think it&#39;s actually green.  Even though Paul&#39;s care for his Pok√©mon is largely arbitrary, the fact that he&#39;s putting that time in, rather than pumping them full of Rare Candies to get them fully evolved as soon as possible, is an aspect of green.  He&#39;s letting the Pok√©mon grow on their own time, getting them experience points and effort values bit by bit as he battles Sue trainers.  (Which I just remembered is outlawed . . . in the <i>modern</i> setting . . . maybe Paul&#39;s screwing around back in the day is the reason for that rule existing now?)<br><br>Paul is BUG.  Though he has no Bug-types.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit realizes it will be hard for anyone else to debate his characters when he has published so little material</p>

            <p>Character analysis is a hobby of mine, and I spend a fair bit of time thinking about it.  That&#39;s why this article was so in-depth.  I was also writing this for over a month because it was schuled for Feb 15, but got pushed back for a different article.  Anyway, let&#39;s take a look at what you&#39;ve got.<br><br>I&#39;m kind of surprised that there is not Blue in Doc&#39;s colors.  Maybe it is just a difference of perspective, I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s just a color I would associate with you and, by extension, Doc.<br><br>I do like your analysis of White in Doc&#39;s first paragraph.  It seems to be a kind of self-sacrificing thing, and that fits very nicely into White, which believes that the individual is less important than the cause (the animals at the zoo, in your case).<br><br>I like that you gave Vania a splash color in Blue.  Not all colors need to be fully realized in a character at all times.  As a card, Vania would probably be White/Red nine times out of ten.  But every once in a while she might be all three, or even White/Blue.<br><br>I&#39;m really impressed by your analysis of Paul, in particular.  You&#39;ve really put a lot of thought into why he does what he does.  Maybe because you felt no one would know who he was, so you had to go the extra mile?  From your descriptions I get a very good idea of who this character is, and totally agree with your color choices.  He reminds me of a guy from Season 1 of the Pokemon Anime.  The guy with the &quot;gym&quot; where he was training his Sandshrew.<br><br>Anyway, I think you have done an excellent job with all three of these characters.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>At his face, Doc definitely presents as the type of character <i>Magic</i> would portray as blue.  But I tried to look at him the way you looked at those Avengers, by motivation rather than by attributes.  He&#39;s not reading to gain knowledge, but to be better at his job, and because he enjoys it to nearly unhealthy levels.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit only has the &quot;unhealthy levels&quot; part, of course</p>

            <p>Richard Legard: White/Blue/Red. Richard like the idea of peace, moral and just good, however... While we&#39;re not on the scale of Notary&#39;s &#39;White is pure Order&#39; there is the downside he&#39;s also a rather passive streak there, letting himself follow the order and, more often than not, the logic, the facts and his head rather than guts. <br><br>Yet, deep down he&#39;s emotionally invested behind the passivity and the intellect, and would like to express this more. To steal from oter systems, his behaviour can lead him to Lawful Neutral, but deep down he craves the idea of being Chaotic Good... Provided his worldviews and ideals aren&#39;t shattered first.<br><br>Marina Nicodelli: White/Black/Red. Marina is less about &#39;good&#39; as order, but she would very much like to see a world of peace and ione of rules followed... Except of course reality doesn&#39;t work that way. The world is unfair, and sometimes enforcing some form of order requires to break some rules... So be it, be she&#39;s very much not letting the means take the lead on the ends, some rules aren&#39;t escapable. <br><br>However, for all the cynism and the order, she will react strongly to any topic sensitive to her. And while she harbors some curiosity about other magics, deep down her response to it is rather emotional, with the discovery of the unknown... provided the unknown don&#39;t break the rules she holds dear or gives answers she dislikes. Moreover, there&#39;s the fact she awaits for the day she can leave the PPC behind, in no small part because of the loved ones she left behind.</p>

            <p><b>Dafydd</b> is a person of deep contrasts. His primary is obviously <b>red</b> - he&#39;s an impulsive individualist, and also a pyro. Secondary has to be his arrogance - as a Feanorion, he&#39;s very sure he&#39;s better than everyone. I think that&#39;s <b>black</b>. But underneath, he&#39;s very much a traditionalist - he gets twitchy when he&#39;s not able to do elven things. So that makes him <b>green</b>.<br><br><b>Agent Kaitlyn</b> is also primarily <b>red</b>, but in a different way - she&#39;s so bouncy that she sees all of life as an adventure. Secondarily, I think she&#39;s <b>white</b> - partly because she Just Wants Everyone To Get Along, but also because she is at heart a rule-follower - she actually requisitioned a chair for herself, rather than stealing one! Tertiary... I&#39;m not sure she has one; <b>blue</b>, if anything, because she is pretty smart.<br><br><b>Morgan</b> is primarily <b>white</b>. She sees herself as a creature of order, and tries to get people to rally to the cause. (This has on at least one occasion led her to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bFaqnyKq4BQJ8z4_Zy9eVg5lbEptyC9RCnb9TrxTELk/pub">conquer all of reality</a>, but, y&#39;know, it happens.) Backing that up is her <b>blue</b> character, as someone who will plan herself into the ground if given the chance. But... buried under all that is a fiery strain of <b>red</b>, which tends to lead her to wild improvising and occasional explosions.<br><br>I&#39;m having trouble with <b>Selene</b>. I think her primary might be <b>green</b>, odd though that sounds - she&#39;s devoting a lot of energy to not rocking the boat, which is a sort of twisted version of green. Under that she&#39;s definitely <b>red</b>, being a vampire who is driven by her instincts if not careful. And third? ... I don&#39;t think she has one; it would be <b>red</b> again, because under all the above she&#39;s a fragile person who basically just wants a friend. That red is doing double service in two very different aspects.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, arrogance is a difficult thing to categorize.  It can be any of the five colors, depending on what you are being arrogant about.  For instance, a character who thinks he is smarter than everyone else <b>*cough*</b>MagnusTheRed<b>*cough*</b> is arrogant in Blue.  A character who thinks they are better than others because of morality is arrogant in White.<br><br>I think Dafydd is probably arrogant in Green.  He is better than everyone else because of who and what he was born to be (Elf/Feanorian/whatever else).  It&#39;s natural that he should be better than those poor unfortunate souls.  But there&#39;s nothing to be done, they just weren&#39;t born to it like he was, and they should just accept their inferiority.<br><br>Does that ring true?<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>&quot;The galaxy is a mess, and I just need to subjugate or destroy anything that gets in the way of ruling it, by any means necessary.&quot;<br><br>It could&#39;ve been White/Black to begin with, but at some point the Black &quot;me first&quot; side took over.

The order breaks down like this:<br><br><span style=" color:#aaa;">White</span> (4.5)<br><span style=" color:green;">Green</span> (2.5)<br><span style=" color:red;">Red</span> (2.5)<br><span>Black</span> (2)<br><span style=" color:blue;">Blue</span> (1.5)<br><br><u><b>Traitor</b></u><br><br>III Emperor&#39;s Children: <span style=" color:blue;">Blue</span>/<span style=" color:green;">Green</span><br>IV Iron Warriors: <span style=" color:green;">Green</span>/<span style=" color:blue;">Blue</span><br>VIII Night Lords: <span>Black</span>/<span style=" color:#aaa;">White</span><br>XII World Eaters: <span>Black</span>/<span style=" color:red;">Red</span><br>XIV Death Guard: <span>Black</span>/<span style=" color:green;">Green</span><br>XV Thousand Sons: <span style=" color:blue;">Blue</span>/<span style=" color:red;">Red</span><br>XVI Sons of Horus: <span style=" color:red;">Red</span>/<span style=" color:green;">Green</span><br>XVII Word Bearers: <span style=" color:red;">Red</span>/<span style=" color:#aaa;">White</span><br>XX Alpha Legion: <span>Black</span>/<span style=" color:blue;">Blue</span><br><br>On the flip side, here we have four primary Black, no secondary Black, and no primary White, only two secondary White. The Night Lords represent the current coloration of Black/White.<br><br>Next in predominance is Red (two primary, two secondary) or Blue (also two primary, two secondary), then Green (one primary, three secondary).<br><br>Breaking it down the same way, we get:<br><br><span>Black</span> (4)<br><span style=" color:blue;">Blue</span> (3)<br><span style=" color:red;">Red</span> (3)<br><span style=" color:green;">Green</span> (2.5)<br><span style=" color:#aaa;">White</span> (1)<br><br>It&#39;s not quite a perfect mirror around a Red axis, but it&#39;s close.

            <p><b><u>Wobbles the Clown</u></b>: WHITE/RED/GREEN<br>Primary: White. Wobbles is someone who wants people to be <i>happy</i>. It&#39;s the core of her being. Helping people be happy, putting things in place so that people who aren&#39;t happy can become happy, these are things she views as the highest good. &#39;S&#39;why she tried out for the Department of Angst before being shoved into Floaters.<br>Secondary: Red. Wobbles is very much an emotionally driven person - and it&#39;s here that we see the slightly darker side of that. See, Wobbles abhors negative emotions (classic Whovians may recall the Happiness Patrol) and does everything in her power to defy and diminish them, regardless of how healthy that may be in the long run. It&#39;s emotional freedom, but only the freedom to feel certain emotions, which is why she&#39;s only a secondary Red and not a primary.<br>Tertiary: Green. It was a struggle as to which of these went first, but I decided to put Red as having precedence over Green despite her enforced connection to the natural world (or rather, her enforced disavowal of modern technology). Indeed, it might be because it&#39;s so forced; it&#39;s not so much a part of her psyche as it is a part of her physiology. <i>Hroa</i> rather than <i>fear</i>, as the elves say.<br><br><b><u>The Fifth Notary</u></b>: WHITE/BLACK/BLUE<br>Primary: White: This is an entirely different kind of White to Wobbles. The Notary craves structure more than anything else, a system of rules and regulations that govern everything from Brownian motion in a teacup to the dance of galactic clusters. This basic, intrinsic need for <i>order</i> above all else makes her White alignment somewhat darker than others, but ho hum. Remember, to a non-believer, even the holiest angel is just another monster.<br>Secondary: Black: Of course, as far as the Notary&#39;s concerned, the whole <i>point</i> of a system is to learn how to rig it in your favour. This is the central conflict in her psyche; she craves order and rules, but chafes against their restrictions when they get in the way of what she actually wants.<br>Tertiary: Blue: In order to get ahead in a system governed by rules, you have to understand them; in order to understand them, you have to be smart in a lot of different ways. The Notary embodies this to an extent; a very detail-oriented person with an axe to grind against improperly-completed forms. Again, it was a struggle as to which of these was the stronger attribute.<br><br><b><u>Lola McCandless</u></b>: BLUE/WHITE/RED<br>Primary: Blue: When it comes to field command, you need command intelligence. You need to have a precise and in-depth knowledge of tactics and logistics, of what you can get and when it will get there, of what you have to hand and who you have by your side. She didn&#39;t have it to begin with, but having horrible alien space thingies hurl plasma at your face tends to teach you that fairly fast.<br>Secondary: White: Of course, being at the top of the heap means you have to have a heap to be on top of, and that means at least a little bit of White being involved in your psychological makeup. Lola&#39;s view of the chain of command is that it works because the higher-ups <i>make</i> it work, and that it has to be there in order for anything to function on a logistical level. From chaos comes death, in her view and her experience. XCOM is not a nice place, especially when crossed over with everything from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Captain Scarlet.<br>Tertiary: Red: Part of being a good commander in the field, however, is being flexible. If you overplan, you can construct something overcomplicated and that leads to failure and the deaths of good men and women under your command. This kind of lateral thinking is what allows for her to keep fighting and get people out alive even when the plan&#39;s gone to hell and the Sectopods are stomping towards you like a drunken stepdad taking off his belt. It needs a level of emotional intelligence and knowledge of morale, and that&#39;s a pretty Red characteristic if ever there was one. =]</p>

            <p>I love that both Wobbles and the Notary have White as their primary, but they display it in very different ways.<br><br>Wobbles is White like  MLP is White.

            <p>Lessee here...<br><br>Thoth: U/R/B. I mean, blue is the primary, that doesn&#39;t take any explanation a all. His dubious moral compass and fundamental self-interest make black another obvious choice. However, beneath that most readily observable surface, Thoth has a deep desire for freedom ‚Äî it&#39;s part of what drove him to the PPC to begin with. And while his history has made it rare for him to form bonds (and his relative lack of emoting makes it hard for many to even attempt it) when he does, they go fairly deep. He&#39;s willing to go pretty far for something or someone he values.<br><br>Tom: R/U/W. Tom tends to run on emotions. He&#39;ll do things because he thinks it&#39;s right, or funny, or wasn&#39;t actually thinking at all but rationalized it later. However, as a person who worked with long chains of abstract logic all day, he&#39;s got a lot of blue to his outlook as well: valuing knowledge and self-improvement, and perfection in his work (because the alternative is demons everywhere). Despite all of this, Tom believes in the group over the individual (hard not to, given what the Laundryverse is like), and has a very solid sense of right and wrong beneath everything.</p>

            <p>So, you&#39;ve got Thoth as U/R/B (U=Blue for those not familiar with MTG shorthand).  I like this because when I went through and tried to give a two-color combination to each Legion, the Thousand Sons were U/R.  Blue for the obvious knowledge-over-everything mentality.  The Red is for that resistance to rules that caused their fall in the first place.  So, being that he is a Thousand Son, that is a good starting point for Thoth.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Now, let&#39;s see how much I remember. {= D Starting with who I&#39;ve been thinking about the most recently:<br><br><b>Derik:</b> Red/White/Black. You, and he himself, would probably think the White would come first, what with how much he cares about order, protection, justice, and all that good stuff. However, it&#39;s his emotions that make him go, and sometimes go too far, which is what Red is all about. And occasionally, the influence of Black makes him pretty dang scary.<br><br><b>Gall:</b> Red again, but this time Red/Green. Green thinks what it has is pretty great, and it can always get bigger and better. If you mess with it, it will unleash the wrath of nature on you. Gall knows she&#39;s pretty great, and if you mess with her, she will unleash the wrath of a Monstrous Nightmare on you. Or she&#39;ll do whatever because she feels like it, because Red. Life&#39;s an adventure, yo! (I understand Red/Green is the color pair of dragons in MTG, so yeah, go figure.)<br><br><b>Nume:</b> Primary Blue, because Blue is all about the mind, knowledge, and memory. Secondary White, because rules, order, and protection. Nume does what he does because he knows he&#39;s the smartest man in the room, and he knows he&#39;s right, and he doesn&#39;t need anybody else&#39;s approval, dammit.<br><br><b>Ilraen:</b> <i>Yes</i>, he&#39;s Blue. But it&#39;s not his primary. Ilraen is actually doing the White/Red thing properly: doing the Right Thing because it is Right, and it Feels Good to Do Good, and you Don&#39;t Mess With Family. He&#39;s all heart‚Äîbut with a side of wicked smart that will come up and catch you by surprise if you&#39;re not paying attention, which is where the tertiary Blue comes in. Plus he likes tinkering with technology. So, White/Red/Blue.<br><br><b>Jenni:</b> ... I don&#39;t even know, to be honest. Like, I&#39;d think White/Green, maybe White/Green/Red, but it&#39;s not right. She&#39;s not really about the group (Green/White is ALL about the group), she&#39;s about individuals and feelings and relationships and family (Red), and being incredibly psychic (Blue) but keeping it in check because morals and rules (White), and basically just making things better (also Blue?). Maybe she&#39;s our actual Red/White/Blue character? Phobos, help me out!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Min has problems with being left out of things, and is rather ambitious. She can also be very callous towards her enemies and thoughtless about things as a whole, which gives her a hint of Black.<br></p>

            <p>About Nume&#39;s primary being Blue, I mean. I did guess Ilraen would have the colors you picked for him. Gall being red is perfect.

            <p>Brightbeard - Brightbeard likes everything to be neat, orderly, and structured.  This puts him solidly in White, as does his strong moral compass.  He also values tradition, community, and growth, which makes his second color Green.  I can&#39;t really get a read on a third color, so White-Green will have to work.<br><br>Barid - Barid is kind of ruled by his emotions and he&#39;s a bit of a force of Chaos.  That makes him a good foil to his partner and it also puts him in Red.  His methods (poisoning and shadow magic), as well as the fact that he is only in business for himself, makes him Black.  If he has a third color, it is probably Blue.  He&#39;s smarter than he looks and does have a love of maps and exploration.  So, I&#39;ll go with Red-Black-Blue for Barid.<br><br>Decima - So, we&#39;ve got a Slytherin.  That means ambition, and ambition means Black, right?  Well, that&#39;s definite in there, it is tertiary for her.  Her strongest color is White, because she wants systems and order (she once apologized for the state of her room when there was a single sock out of place).  Her second color is Green because she is inflexible in her world-view, as seen by her inability to accept how exorcisms work because the process doesn&#39;t conform to her views of magic.  She has such a hard time with things in the couple of missions she has, because the PPC has given a major blow to her view of the world, and she is slow to adjust to that.

            <p>Thank you <i>so</i> much for making the Red, White, and Blue joke for Cap. That made my day.<br><br>So... looking at my characters, I&#39;m starting to realize how many of them are pretty identical when it comes to colors. Most of them fall pretty squarely in the Red-White-Green triad.<br><br><b>The Aviator:</b><br>Primary: Red. Ave&#39;s made it pretty clear she values her freedom and will be leaving the PPC once there aren&#39;t any people left to tie her down. She&#39;s hot-headed and emotional, and doesn&#39;t always think things through.<br>Secondary: White. She&#39;s loyal to her partner and family and will do whatever it takes to keep them safe. <br>Tertiary? Eh. If anyone can think of a good reason for one, I&#39;m all ears, but Blue, Black, and Green don&#39;t really fit her. <br><br><b>Zeb:</b><br>Primary: White. Zeb&#39;s a lion, it makes sense he values community. He&#39;s self-sacrificing and hates to see others in pain. And he just wants everyone to get along.<br>Secondary: Green. He knows his place in the universe and he&#39;s pretty content to accept it.<br>Tertiary: Red. Zeb thinks with his heart, not his head, and it shows.<br><br><b>Ix</b><br>Primary: Black. Funnily enough, I didn&#39;t see this one coming until I got to thinking about it. Ix has long since come to accept that nobody&#39;s looking out for her (...well, except Charlotte) and it&#39;s up to her to make the most of it with what she&#39;s got. She&#39;s driven‚Äîshe put in a lot of hard work to get to where she is‚Äîand knows the instant she stumbles, she&#39;ll fall right back to the bottom. The world isn&#39;t going to be kind to you, so you&#39;d better seize whatever opportunities you can to keep yourself from becoming a target.<br>Secondary: White. Ix just wants everything to be okay. So although she doesn&#39;t believe that will ever be the case, she still tries to make things better where she can.<br>Tertiary: Red. Despite what she says, she&#39;s still in Gryffindor for a reason.<br><br><b>Charlotte:</b><br>Primary: Green. Everything happens for a reason, whether you like it or not, so you&#39;d better figure out what to do with what you have. Sure, it doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t complain about it the whole way through, but she&#39;s not generally one to fight for change. With one major exception, which leads me to her second color...<br>Secondary: Red. She (like so many of my characters) once again thinks with her heart instead of her head. She wants something, she wants it now. When she decided she was going to become human for Ix, she went and did it at the first opportunity. When she gets determined about something, she does see it through.<br>Tertiary: And once again, I fail to think of a third.<br><br><b>Dax:</b><br>Primary: Red. He and the Aviator share the same taste for adventure and going out into the world to experience everything it has to offer. He&#39;s also, ahem, passionate. He&#39;s here to have a good time.<br>Secondary/Tertiary: White and Green. Dax has a strong sense of justice (He <i>is</i> Chaotic Good) and after being a guard on a skyship for a while, he&#39;s got a pretty strong sense of loyalty to whoever he considers his extended family.<br><br><b>Lorson:</b><br>Ah, Lorson, thank god you&#39;re here to provide a break from the monotony. Well, sort of.<br>Primary: Red. Lorson values freedom over anything else. He is his own man now, and he takes advantage of that by living life to the fullest and not concerning himself too deeply with the consequences.<br>Secondary/Tertiary: Black and Blue. It&#39;s a dog-eat-dog world out there, and no matter what happens, he plans on surviving no matter the cost. The best way to do this is through knowledge. His mind, more than anything else, is what he considers his best weapon. Lorson strives to be the best he can possibly be. He has an insatiable thirst for knowledge and he&#39;s big on the whole technological aspect that usually gets overlooked in Blue&#39;s personality.<br><br>Hoo boy, that turned out a lot longer than I thought it would.</p>

            <p>Now, about your characters all coming out in the same three colors...that&#39;s totally fine.  Two characters in the same color combination can be very different.  It all depends on the balance of the colors, as well as what aspects of a color a character exhibits.<br><br>For example: Batman and Lex Luthor are the same three colors.  They are very different characters, though.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Batman is all about Justice, which is a White ideal.  How he goes about getting that Justice (fear and intimidation) is decidedly against the law, which is fairly Black.  There is also a fair amount of high-technology and detective work, so I would put him in Blue for a tertiary.<br><br>Batman - White-Black-Blue<br><br>Lex Luthor is out for his own advancement, no matter the cost or legality, so based in Black.  However, he uses the fact that he is a &quot;legitimate businessman&quot;, as well as using the systems of justice, to shield himself and his nefarious schemes, which is surprisingly White.  He is also a very intelligent, very resourceful man, which is Blue.<br><br>Lex Luthor - Black-White-Blue<br><br>Bonus: Catwoman is only out for herself and her cats.  The world doesn&#39;t care about her, so she doesn&#39;t care about it. So she&#39;s based in Black.  However, she is also smart and ridiculously skilled at what she does, and that actually falls under Blue.  However, there is also a little part of her that wants to be the good guy, that wants (certain kinds of) bad guys to be brought to justice, and that means White.<br><br>Catwoman - Black-Blue-White</p>

Tell me, O wise one, that I might learn your ancient secrets.&quot;<br><br>Em just laughed, which was definitely helpful and in no way at all made Cassie want to nail her to the outside of a speeding train. &quot;Gurl, HQ&#39;s a weird place, &#39;s&#39;all I&#39;m saying. You were bound to wind up on a date some time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh really?&quot; Cassie&#39;s voice had that forced politeness to it common to teachers about to go absolutely postal on the little turds in Form 4B. &quot;And I suppose you are too, by that logic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Like I said, HQ&#39;s hella weird. One time, I got chased around by animated luncheon meat, so a date like this one you&#39;re on? Not so crazy. At least your date didn&#39;t eat your laptop or something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eat my - you know, I was just thinking the dessert menu around here was a little lacking in variety.&quot; Cassie glanced around at her surroundings. &quot;Too heavy on the fruit for my liking.&quot;<br><br>Em cackled. &quot;Damn, Cass.

It&#39;s horrible.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I knoooow.&quot; Em shrugged. &quot;Could be worse. The heat could be stuck on again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I need about half a dozen showers and a Scourgify. These robes have absolutely had it. And now is a really bad time to find out my shoes don&#39;t fit properly any more. Bloody hell. My feet are <i>killing</i> me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mine too. These sweatpants are <i>designer</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Isn&#39;t that a contradiction in terms?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Haaaa.&quot;<br><br>The two agents paced around a bit more, grimacing at the state of themselves.<br><br>&quot;And that guy from Building Maintenance was <i>really</i> unhelpful,&quot; Cassie said after a while. &quot;I told him about this bloody date I&#39;m on and what did he do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Said &#39;Congratulations&#39;, mumbled something about a bomb threat, and hung up. Which you told me. Like, four times now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, it bears repeating.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not. Four. Times.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... I suppose not, but it irked me a bit, that&#39;s all. Sorry, Em, I don&#39;t mean to go on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know, Cass, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br><br>They embraced for a moment, then recoiled before they stuck together.<br><br>&quot;Cass?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Em?&quot;<br><br>Em pointed at the edge of the giant date they were standing on top of. &quot;Uh... how do we get down?&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>I&#39;m a complete cow sometimes. &gt;=]</p>

            <p>Ix knocked on the door of the bathroom before fiddling with her tie. &quot;Our reservation&#39;s at seven, and we still have to make it down to New Cal.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gimme one more minute,&quot; Charlotte called.<br><br>Ix sighed and leaned against the wall, resisting the urge to run her fingers through her gelled hair. She pulled her phone out of her pocket and turned on the selfie camera, examining her face for what felt like the hundredth time that hour. Charlotte had done some phenomenal work with the concealer, and though her scars were still obviously visible, they weren&#39;t as angry and red and attention-drawing as normal. She had to resist the urge to touch her face, too. <br><br>Everything about her looked... different. Good different. She looked <i>handsome</i>. Her cheekbones were sharp, her eyebrows angular, and when she smiled, she could almost ignore the way her scars pulled down the corner of her mouth.<br><br>It was a strange feeling, but one she wouldn&#39;t mind getting to experience more often.<br><br>The door to the bathroom opened and Ix hastily stowed her phone in her suit&#39;s pocket, eyes going wide when she got a look at Charlotte. &quot;Whoa.&quot;<br><br>Charlotte slowly turned around so Ix could properly see the backless evening gown, its purple silk draped elegantly over her frame. &quot;You like?&quot; She blinked slowly, pale lavender eye shadow visible behind her glasses.<br><br>&quot;Very much,&quot; Ix said, swallowing. &quot;Wow. Lottie, you look beautiful.&quot;<br><br>Charlotte stepped up to her, leaning on tiptoes to kiss Ix. &quot;And you look absolutely <i>dashing</i> in that suit,&quot; she said, wrapping her arms around Ix&#39;s waist. &quot;You should wear it more often. Go for that James Bond look.&quot;<br><br>Ix snorted. &quot;If anything, I&#39;m channeling Blofeld,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;A really hot Blofeld, then,&quot; Charlotte said, kissing her again. &quot;Or Alec Trevelyan. But we should get going; I already wasted enough time doing my makeup.&quot;<br><br>Ix offered her an arm and Charlotte looped hers through. &quot;My lady,&quot; she said, and they headed to the door.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Okay: how do I look?&quot; Gall stepped out of the bathroom and spread her arms.<br><br>On his cot, Derik lowered <i>The Tempest</i> and rolled over to his right far enough to look at her without twisting his neck.<br><br>There was a moment. Gall was familiar with this moment. It was almost like a staring contest, each of them watching and waiting to see if something would happen. It hadn&#39;t yet, and Gall was getting a bit desperate. Not that she was <i>desperate</i>, mind you, just frustrated. But not <i>frustrated</i>. She wasn&#39;t pining away for Twu Wub like some yak-brained idiot. It was just . . .<br><br>Derik tilted his head and raised an eyebrow. &quot;Like you raided the darkest, most humiliating depths of Elms&#39; closet,&quot; he said.<br><br>The moment ended, like it always did, in disappointment. Gall sighed heavily and rolled her eyes.<br><br>Derik went on: &quot;I thought you said you were going to World One. That can&#39;t be appropriate.&quot;<br><br>Dammit, she&#39;d been sure this would get a reaction. The low white bodice with the sleeves hanging off her shoulders, the tight green leather corset and matching skirt, the sheer white stockings and black buckled shoes . . . the costume didn&#39;t leave much to the imagination. Okay, so Gall didn&#39;t have much to flaunt in the assets department, but the corset helped, and the color suited her complexion, too. She was a natural redhead. That was supposed to count for something, dammit!<br><br>&quot;Shows what you know,&quot; she huffed. &quot;This is totally traditional. I&#39;m supposed to be, like, a leprechaun or something. Buy me a green beer and I&#39;ll show you me pot o&#39; gold.&quot; She cocked her hips and grinned. That was a pretty good line, if she did say so herself, and she did. &quot;Pretty good, right?&quot;<br><br>Nothing.<br><br><i>Dammit.</i><br><br>Derik sat up. &quot;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong‚Äî&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re wrong.&quot;<br><br>&quot;‚Äîbut I thought this holiday was about a man named Patrick driving snakes off an island that never had any to begin with. What does this‚Äî&quot; he gestured to all of her &quot;‚Äîhave to do with that?&quot;<br><br>She shrugged. &quot;Hell if I know. Who cares? It&#39;s an excuse to party, and everything has to be green. Green clothes, green beer, green food‚Äîand get this: the city we&#39;re going to, Chicago? Gremlin says they turn their <i>river</i> green.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you sure she&#39;s not winding you up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. But again, who cares, as long as there&#39;s booze and hot people?&quot; In a brilliantly unsubtle segue, she added, &quot;You could come if you want. I bet we could find you a shamrock thong.&quot; Gods, she wished.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Derik said far more quickly and decisively than was fair. &quot;You and Gremlin have your Girls&#39; Night. I&#39;ll stay in this time.&quot; He held up his book, telling her he planned to be extremely boring and sit around reading all night.<br><br>She sighed again. &quot;Fine. Don&#39;t forget to sweep out the fireproof corner, it&#39;s getting all sooty again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine, fine.&quot; He flicked his fingers; he&#39;d take care of it. &quot;Go. Have fun.&quot;<br><br>He really meant that last part. <i>Dammit.</i><br><br>She smirked at him. &quot;Hey, if I come home with someone, do you want me to warn you, or what?&quot;<br><br>He looked down at his book and shrugged those perfectly contoured shoulders she was dying to sink her fingers and possibly her teeth into. &quot;I&#39;ll clear out if you like. I would prefer a warning, but if that isn&#39;t possible, an awkward scramble will have to suffice.&quot;<br><br><i>Dammit.</i> &quot;Heh. Yeah, fair enough.&quot;<br><br>The sad part was, if he&#39;d just been a normal person and jumped her bones as soon as she made it clear she was interested, that probably would have been the end of it. As it stood, his bizarre and unnatural reluctance was like a challenge, and she never backed down from a challenge. She had never expected it to go on this long, and she knew she should have given up ages ago, but without her notice, things had changed. The longer it dragged out, the less it was about pure, clean animal lust, and the more it became about something much harder to define, like maybe principles or honor. Whatever. The point was, she knew he would come around one day. She didn&#39;t know how she knew, but she did. And when that day came, she would be there, and all would be right with the world.<br><br>But in the meantime, she&#39;d party with her best friend, get drunk on green beer, and maybe get a little action to tide her over.<br><br>&quot;All right, I&#39;m off to paint the town green. Catch you later!&quot;<br><br>One day.<br><br><hr>
<br>This is set in the very near future, obviously. Apologies for the distilled cultural insensitivity that is a typical St. Patrick&#39;s Day celebration in these parts. Personally, I make a point of staying indoors on whatever Saturday they do the thing with the river. Drunk loonies everywhere. *shudder*<br><br>I kinda feel like I should apologize for taking you inside Gall&#39;s head, too, but really getting in there and figuring out how it works is something <i>I</i> need to do, so y&#39;all get to take the journey with me. The MTG colors thread has actually helped with this, making the title all the more appropriate. ^<em>^<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The</a></em>Tempest&quot;&gt;Just in case</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospero">anyone is wondering</a> <a href="http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Prospero">why <i>The Tempest</i>.</a> (It&#39;s funny.

            <p>Most of the hits on Google when I looked up &quot;sexy Irish costume&quot; just looked like Generic Tavern Wench var. Green. This looks like it would actually translate into something cute. I love the shamrock in the hair; I&#39;d have included something like that or a tiny top hat, but it wasn&#39;t really relevant to the passage. Thank you! ^<em>^<br><br>No follow-up scene, sorry. I believe Gall has a fairly high tolerance and enough self-control to cut herself off while she still has some of her wits, because <i>someone</i> in the partnership has to. She can in fact be slightly responsible when pressed.<br><br>What&#39;s wrong with Derik in a thong, shamrock or otherwise? It&#39;s only his face that&#39;s mangled. ^</em>~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As usual, Nesh is on-point. I don&#39;t have anything to complain about, and I always enjoy a peek inside the head of a character.<br><br>For some reason, probably because I&#39;m incredibly narcissistic or something, I tend to like examining parallels between Nesh&#39;s prompt response and my own. Usually poorly, because I&#39;m not exactly a great literary analyst. So allow me to do that thing!<br><br>Nesh and I had a theme in common this week, and one I think we&#39;ll see more of as more people turn in responses: frustration, sexual or romantic. However, we handled it differently. In this story, Gall&#39;s desires for Derik take center stage. By contrast, in my fic, Tom&#39;s feelings and wants around relationships and dating and such aren&#39;t really the core of the story: they&#39;re very important, yes, but that story is really about showing another side of the relationship between my agents: that Tom isn&#39;t always a goof making jabs, and Thoth isn&#39;t always dead serious, despite appearances. They have more in common than you would expect at first glance‚Äîif you&#39;ve read the magic thread, they share the same primary and secondary, just in reverse order.<br><br>Oddly enough, despite these differences, both stories were primarily about exploring the relationship between a team of agents. But they are different relationships, and they are explored in very different ways.<br><br>That&#39;s all I really have for now. Keep up the good work.</p>

            <p>‚Äú‚ÄòEy, Thoth! Where‚Äôre you going?‚Äù Tom didn‚Äôt even look all the way up from his console as the Space Marine walked towards the door.<br><br>The marine in question was, unusually, not dressed in his armor. He kept a simple robe for such occasions, which is what he was wearing. After an incident involving Luxury in a particularly mischievous mood, a pair of extremely large sweatpants scrounged from somewhere had been added to the outfit, as an extra insurance of decency. He turned to face his partner. ‚ÄúTom, I am going on a‚Ä¶ date.‚Äù<br><br>Tom blinked, finally looking up. ‚ÄúWhat.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúA date,‚Äù Thoth continued. ‚ÄúWith a girl. I understand you are aware of the concept.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYeah, but‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a Space Marine. Don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶‚Äù Tom let out a sigh. ‚ÄúNevermind. Whatever. Who‚Äôre you going with?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúTalia Ornix, DoSAT,‚Äù Thoth replied. ‚ÄúNow, I believe I must go.‚Äù He shut the door behind him, leaving Tom in the gloom of the RC.<br><br>Tom got back to work. For all of five minutes. For some reason, he couldn‚Äôt focus, his thoughts wandering back to what Thoth had said. Talia was‚Ä¶ cool. Good. He was very happy for them.<br><br>Tom sighed, speaking to nobody in particular. ‚ÄúWho am I kidding? I something to take my mind off this.‚Äù<br><br>~~<br><br>Rudi‚Äôs was moderately crowded, and just loud enough to distract anyone trying to think. That was just fine by Tom. Farah Tahar was up by the bar, and, judging by her expression, was probably explaining to the newbie next to her that no, the name of her species was not ‚Äúcatgirl.‚Äù Off in a corner, Peregrin was trying to read, with mixed success. As if any more noise was required, someone had brought in a piano, somehow. An entity with a frankly uncomfortable number of tentacles was currently behind it playing a rendition of ‚ÄúPiano Man‚Äù that would have been impossible for anyone with less appendages, while a group of assassins looked on.<br><br>Tom took a seat at the bar that wasn‚Äôt directly next to anyone. He didn‚Äôt really feel like talking to anyone. He ordered a Coke with added Bleep, and tried to lose himself in the music. It wasn‚Äôt that he‚Ä¶ liked Talia, per se, he told himself. Sure, she was very cute, and she seemed nice, and she was DoSAT, so he could actually talk to her effectively‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt that. It was just‚Ä¶ well, he supposed he was jealous of his partner‚Äôs success. He‚Äôd never had a date in his life. And heck, did Space Marines even have an interest? Even if they did, why the heck would someone go out with one? Well, except maybe Gall‚Ä¶ He spared himself a grin, recalling her antics at Halloween.<br><br>He sighed, resting his head on the bar. Jeez. How long had he been working, anyways, before this? He couldn‚Äôt even remember... <br><br>‚Ä¶<br><br>The next thing Tom knew, someone was poking at his back.<br><br>‚ÄúHey, you awake? SYN, anyone?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWha, a‚Äì buh? ACK! ACK!‚Äù He abruptly pulled his head. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up? I‚Äôm up! Things! Stuff! Activities!‚Äù<br><br>The assailant giggled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me. Come on, Tom. How‚Äôs your day been?‚Äù<br><br>Tom finally managed to get a good look the person behind him. Tall, short black hair, a smirk on her full lips, DoSAT patch‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTalia? ‚Äòs that you?‚Äù <br><br>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of a tech who looks exactly like me, so it must be. For that matter, how many techs tend to want to touch anything from your universe?‚Äù Talia gave a smile. ‚ÄúNo, really, how‚Äôre you doing?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOkay, I guess‚Ä¶‚Äù Tom stared back blearily. ‚ÄúSo anyways, how was the date?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou know, with Thoth?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOoooh, that! Yeah, I did go on a date with Thoth‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Tom sighed under his breath.<br><br>‚Äú...if by date, you mean upgrading his dataslates to interface with something that‚Äôs not terrible. I swear, those things make token-ring look elegant‚Ä¶‚Äù Talia frowned. ‚ÄúGlad that‚Äôs over.‚Äù<br><br>Tom shook his head rapidly. ‚ÄúWait, what? So‚Ä¶ not liked a date-date.‚Äù<br><br>Talia frowned. ‚ÄúSpace Marines don‚Äôt date, Tom. I‚Äôm not even even a field agent, why am I explaining your main canon to you?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo, I know that, but‚Ä¶ Thoth said‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh, because that makes perfect sense.‚Äù Talia rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúSo, just to get this straight, your partner, scary ex-worshipper of the god of lies and deception told you something that conflicted with your view of reality in a massive way‚Ä¶ and you just believed him. Wow, great thinking, Tom.‚Äù<br><br>‚Äú...are you implying I‚Äôm an idiot?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm telling you you‚Äôre an idiot. Subtlety is not my specialty.‚Äù<br><br>Tom smiled slightly. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Thanks, I guess? Now I‚Äôll go‚Ä¶ not punch my partner in the face, because he‚Äôs pretty scary.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou go do that.‚Äù Talia grinned. ‚ÄúJust so we‚Äôre clear, I am never letting you live this down. Well, not until you beat me at StarCraft, anyways‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHey! It‚Äôll happen one day!‚Äù called back Tom over his shoulder.<br><br>‚ÄúNot a chance‚Ä¶‚Äù Talia said. But Tom was already gone.<br><br>~~<br><br>‚ÄúThoth, do you ever lie to me?‚Äù<br><br>Thoth turned another page in his novel. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, dispassionately. ‚ÄúI have not, technically, ever told you anything that is untrue.‚Äù <br><br>Tom sighed. ‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúBecause you must maintain any talent you intent to keep,‚Äù said Thoth. ‚ÄúAdditionally, I have an abundance of free time. For the first time since I began my training as a Thousand Son, I have had to consider how to spend it.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Tom spoke in a tone spiked with incredulity. ‚ÄúYou mess with me‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre bored.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAn accurate summation, yes. Although you are remarkably easy to deceive.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ You‚Ä¶‚Äù Tom deflated then, remembering Talia‚Äôs words. ‚ÄúOkay, you might actually have a point‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>--<br><br>Tom, Thoth, and Talia all belong to me (Jeez, I need to stop making characters with names that start with T). Peregrin and Farah belong to Tomash, used here with permission. The rest belongs to a lot of people, you know the drill.<br></p>

            <p>I am ashamed to say this got me worried. I mean, my first reaction was &quot;Bwuh? No way. What&#39;s the punchline?&quot; Like, it&#39;s right there in the title, it&#39;s not even a surprise. And the sweatpants. Nobody goes on a romantic date in sweatpants. But Tom taking the thing so seriously made <i>me</i> start to take it seriously, and while Derik would certainly not be jealous if Thoth did find someone eventually, that somehow doesn&#39;t stop <i>me</i> from going &quot;but I thought what they had was special *wibble wibble sad puppy eyes*&quot;. That&#39;s pretty pathetic. And also hypocritical, given my own plans. I mean, jeez, I think that makes me a worse idiot than Tom. ^<em>^;<br><br>BUT! I tell you this humiliating fact because I think it goes to show that the story does a good job of doing to me exactly what Thoth did to Tom, by virtue of selectively focusing on certain details while downplaying others, and that&#39;s pretty cool.<br><br>I didn&#39;t even notice the adverbs until the end, either, which tells me you&#39;re doing it right. Kudos!<br><br>Oh, and Talia seems cool, and she&#39;s obviously interested in Tom. She said she wants to touch him. There is no other fair reading of that line. ^</em>~ So, yay!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So... uh... kudos?<br><br>Yeah, Talia and Tom could potentially go somewhere. Maybe. I dunno. She&#39;s not really developed enough yet for me to say for sure. They both very much derive from the same sort of inspirations, so they obviously have a lot in common, though they may diverge. Tom would have to get over a bit of his awkwardness first, in any case.<br><br>Also, this is my first real serious attempt at writing a female character. So... judging by the fact that you made you comment about it, I haven&#39;t totally messed it up.<br><br>As your comments about being worried... jeez, thanks! that means a lot, especially coming from someone like you who knows these characters well enough to notice how much doesn&#39;t add up about this whole situation (including, of course, the fact that Thoth would have no interest in dating a girl even if he <i>wasn&#39;t</i> an Astartes, not that Tom knows that).<br><br>Anyways, for the time being Derik is still probably the person Thoth&#39;s opened up the most to, and he doesn&#39;t open up easily.<br><br>...Dangit, I said I wasn&#39;t going to bait the inevitable badfic games ships for those two, but here I am. :P</p>

            <p>Elanor safe in the Nursery? Check. Zeb sufficiently distracted and out of the RC? Check. TARDIS tidied up? Well, sort of check. It was presentable, anyway.<br><br>Hair?<br><br>The Aviator growled out a low string of Gallifreyan swears as she tugged a brush through her snarled locks. Once she had her hair straightened, braiding it would be easy, but right now she was wrestling with a knot the size of her fist, and she was seriously beginning to consider reaching for the scissors.<br><br>Wait‚Äîthere. The rat came loose and the Aviator quickly brushed it smooth before setting to work on braiding.<br><br>She glanced behind her at the black dress she&#39;d laid out on her bed, taken from the TARDIS&#39; wardrobe. She wasn&#39;t normally one for dresses‚Äîcargo pants and tank tops were more her speed‚Äîbut she and the Detective had decided to try and make a proper date out of this. Of course, knowing him, he&#39;d probably show up in his tattered coat as always, but she was <i>trying,</i> dammit.<br><br>Not that this was a date-date. Just a... semi-more-romantic leadup to another night together.<br><br>They weren&#39;t dating.<br><br>That would be silly.<br><br>The Aviator tucked a silver hair comb into the braided bun at the back of her head and frowned. Why was she going to all this trouble when it would all get pulled loose in tonight&#39;s activities?<br><br>She didn&#39;t want to look <i>nice</i> for him or anything. He certainly wasn&#39;t going to go to the same effort.<br><br>It just felt like the thing to do, that was all. That was <i>it.</i> <br><br>The TARDIS hummed in amusement and the Aviator gestured at the ceiling with her middle finger. &quot;Shut it, you,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s not a date. And I&#39;ll thank you to not bother us while we&#39;re busy!&quot;<br><br>The TARDIS rumbled again, but fell silent.<br><br>There was a quick rapping on the door, and the Aviator&#39;s head whipped around when she smelled Zeb on the other side. &quot;Don&#39;t co‚Äî!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just letting you know I&#39;m borrowing the OH MY GOSH ARE YOU GOING ON A DATE TONIGHT IS THE DETECTIVE COMING OVER ARE YOU TWO GONNA KISS?!&quot; Zeb squeed, his mane poofing out as sparks flew from his fur. He bounced in a small circle in the doorway before sprinting away. &quot;I&#39;M BORROWING THE X-BOX DON&#39;T MIND ME OKAY BYE!&quot;<br><br>The Aviator groaned and let her head hit the dresser. So much for keeping the not-date secret.</p>

            <p>I think you may have inadvertently knocked the bottom out of Ave&#39;s denial with the line &quot;she and the Detective had decided to try and make a proper date out of this&quot;‚Äîbecause we&#39;re in her POV, that tells us she does know it is a proper date‚Äîbut I think if you changed that, the rest would work just fine. I like the bits where she&#39;s comparing her own efforts to the Detective&#39;s expected lack thereof, which would make denying the date-ness easier.<br><br>And, well, Zeb. I LOL&#39;ed.

            <p>What I was going for was her thinking &quot;Yeah, this is a date, but it&#39;s not a <i>date</i>-date, even if we&#39;re calling it a date, because it&#39;s not a date, because I am a tsundere and will never admit I actually like him and want to admit this is a proper date.&quot;<br><br>Zeb&#39;s reaction was my favorite part to write.

            <p>It&#39;s been about a week since the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314076;">signup thread</a> went up, and there haven&#39;t been any new posts on it recently. It&#39;s also about to be Spring Break for a whole lot of people.<br><br>Therefore, I&#39;m starting the story thread for this years&#39;s shipfest!<br><br>First, a reminder of the rules:<br>1. Only write fics involving people who have opted in, and respect everyone&#39;s limits. Here is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QsEpZHn3Tds4jm22vyYZ4aVhb54iNpc2lXQk-EJWiS4/edit?usp=sharing">a document summarizing opt-in status and collecting ship suggestions</a>. Please let me know if I&#39;ve made a mistake in there.<br>2. Shipfics should stay PG-13 and SFW.<br>3. Don&#39;t write shipfic involving yourself unless it&#39;s a canon ship. Doing that is weird.<br>4. Have fun!<br><br>If you&#39;re curious, or trying to hunt down every Shipfest for historical reasons, this link leads to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=306100">last year&#39;s stories</a>.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>(( Inspired by what&#39;s going on <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314917">many threads above this</a> ))<br><br>A man in a red suit with way too many guns and swords on him was sitting in a rather featureless white void.<br><br>&quot;Hey. You.&quot; he said, turning to the man that was somehow there. &quot;Birdie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eh?&quot; Huinesoron asked, turning his head.<br><br>&quot;Your name means &#39;eagle shadow&#39; in Quenya,&quot; Deadpool clarified. &quot;which is just <em>way</em> too pretentious if you ask me. So, birdie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Deadpool?&quot; Huinesoron asked, very confused. &quot;The heck is going on here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You should know, you&#39;re the idiot who&#39;s ‚Äî&quot; Deadpool paused. &quot;Actually, no, you&#39;re not writing this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why are you in my house?&quot; Huinesoron said.<br><br>Deadpool had fully materialized near Huinesoron at this point. &quot;Well, you&#39;ve been having such a good time writing me, and I started looking around. There&#39;s some sort of Shipfest going on around here, and I thought we could have some ... other sort of fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m married.&quot; Huinesoron objected.<br><br>Deadpool pulled out a phone and started reading through the Board. &quot;Says here you&#39;ve been sleeping with just about everyone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh. Good point.&quot; Huinesoron said, glancing down at the floor.<br><br>&quot;So, whatddya say to the best lovin&#39; you&#39;ve ever had, courtesy of me, birdie?&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron scratched his head for a moment. &quot;Sure. Sounds like a fun way to spend an evening.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; exclaimed Deadpool. &quot;Your bedroom, or do you want me to bug the author for something more exotic?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s just stay in my apartment.&quot; Huinesoron replied. &quot;I don&#39;t want to break the fourth wall any more than it has been already.&quot;<br><br>The pair of soon-to-be-lovers headed to Huinesoron&#39;s room and closed the door, which had the convenient side effect of keeping the narrator from seeing any of the details of whatever they were up to. A minute or so after they&#39;d gone in, Deadpool&#39;s voice came from within the room: &quot;Those are some sexy sexy abs, birdie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can you stop calling me birdie?&quot; Huinesoron said, irritated. &quot;That&#39;s Thoth&#39;s nickname.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh. Fine. How about I go with feathers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s OK, I guess.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, what do you think of inviting this Thoth guy to this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe later.&quot; Huinesoron said. &quot;Let&#39;s get back to that massage though. It&#39;s been great.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Obviously. I&#39;m the one giving it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Obviously.&quot; Huinesoron and Deadpool could be heard kissing, and then the scene faded to black.<br><br>(( - Tomash ))</p>

Ish.<br><br>For Plort.<br><br>Not the people in Plort, just Plort itself.<br><br>Every day, when Kaitlyn was asleep, he stepped through his favorite portal to Plort, just to spend a little time on her sweet shores. He loved to feel the wind in his hair, the grass under his feet, and the rush of power he got from being the one and only Baron Huinesoron. It did sometimes reach the same level of love he had for Kaitlyn, even a little bit dirty, but he never told anyone.<br><br>Tonight in particular, though, he wasn&#39;t dirty for Plort. He just wanted to show his love. When he entered Plort, he stood at the top of a hill, laid down on his side, and rolled down it like a derp. When he finally lost momentum, he was laughing hard in between shallow breaths. He decided to make the trek back to his castle to see if anything had happened. Twistey&#39;d been editing the Plort Wiki; a smell coming from her equivalent&#39;s shop signified that. Nothing else. Shame that no one else loved Plort as much as he did. But then again... if everyone else was here all the time, he wouldn&#39;t have her all to himself.<br><br>He stood at the top of the tallest tower in his castle and gazed out at the horizon. Then, feeling an impuslse, he spread out his arms and began to sing.<br><br>&quot;I love the mountains<br>I love the clear blue sky<br>I love my castle<br>I love when eagles fly<br>I love the whole Plort<br>And all its sights and sounds<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br><br>I love the oceans<br>And fighting Marizu<br>I love to ride fast<br>No one does like I do!<br>I love the whole Plort<br>And all its craziness<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br><br>I love the small towns<br>I love the baronies<br>I love the wheat fields<br>They mean so much to me<br>I love the whole Plort<br>It&#39;s such a brilliant place<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada<br>Boom de yada...&quot;<br><br>Plort is just awesome.

            <p>Granz&#39;s doorbell rang. He lept out of his chair and ran towards the door &quot;Oh my oh my oh my it&#39;s finally here!&quot; he said quickly, rubbing his palms together.<br><br>He opened the door and took the somewhat thin, large, rectangular envelope from the delivery driver and hastily scrawled a signature on the appropriate line.<br><br>Granz ran back up to his room and set his newly-acquired package on his desk. He began to peel pack the sear on the envelope slowly, trying not to damage the contents. About halfway through the opening, Granz realized he couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and tore the envelope to bits.<br><br>Inside, he found the RPG rulebook he ordered. He picked it up and rubbed his hands over it, caressing the wondrous source of unusual items and possibly overpowered skills, savoring the sensation of all the new ways to minmax the party&#39;s characters he could find inside.<br><br>Grenz then sniffed the book, inhaling the luscious aroma of never-opened pages full of role-playing goodness. &quot;Mmmmm.&quot; he moaned, admiring the cover art.<br><br>He gripped the front cover gently with a few fingers, pulling it open slowly enough that someone might think he was checking the book for traps. (He wasn&#39;t. He just loved this part.) Granz began slowly reading the entries in the book, savoring the armor and gear described within. &quot;Eh, that&#39;s not that useful.&quot;, he said at one point.<br><br>&quot;Hm ... maybe&quot; he commented, after tenderly flipping a page. He scrawled the name of that psychic power on a very full notepad on his desk.<br><br>A few pages later, Granz yelped in excitement. &quot;Oh my god! Yes! This is <em>perfect</em>! And I have enough XP!&quot; he shouted. His fingers flew over the keyboard, firing off a message to his GM, asking if he could take the psychic power he&#39;d just found.<br><br>As he waited for the reply, Granz slowly lost control. He stopped being so tender and caring, and started rapidly flipping through the book, keeping a mental tally of all the super-awesome extra-useful stuff he was finding. The pages of the rulebook almost flew as Granz pawed through them.<br><br>Eventually, he reached the end of the book. He turned everything back over and went through it again, making sure he hadn&#39;t missed a corner of those delectable extra rules. His reading method varied from a measured, careful investigation to a fast, hyped-up, almost predatory flip.<br><br>Throughout all this, he made a lot of comments on the contents of his new acquisition, sometimes taking tens of minutes to debate the relative merits of two options with himself. A few times, he even got up to get other rulebooks to compare against. More books were more fun, after all. Whoops of triumph often fell from Granz&#39;s lips a few times as he used the contents of his new book to formulate the greatest plan he&#39;d ever had ‚Äî which was, rather frequently, superseded be the new greatest plan he&#39;d ever had as he noticed an item he&#39;d overlooked.<br><br>Many, many hours later, it grew late. Rather reluctantly, Granz closed his new book and carefully placed it on the rulebooks shelf, lovingly arranging it next to his existing collection. Finally, Granz turned away from his RPG rulebooks, his true, eternal loves, and <del>went to bed</del> logged onto Amazon to buy another one before picking up another one of his precious volumes from the shelf. <em>I don&#39;t need sleep tonight anyway.</em> he thought, getting ready for more cavorting with supplemental rulesets. <em>It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a session tomorrow.</em><br><br>And so, Granz had a long, simulating night, which he loved every minute of, even though it drove him closer to exhaustion and the lightbulbs in his lamps closer to burning out.<br><br>(( - Tomash ))</p>

            <p>He came up with the idea of the Ixcubus, which inspired this:<br><br><br><br>‚ÄûMatt, are you sure you know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù Aegis looked at his friend slouching over a heavy-looking book bound in leather and metal. Inside, on worn-out yellow pages were scribblings presenting images of complicated circles, diagrams of human body, and various drawings of plants and demonic-looking faces.<br><br>‚ÄúPositive, mate.‚Äù Matt turned the page, before tracing his finger along the longest line of text written in green ink. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting rid of this pest this instant. No offense, Ixi.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNone taken,‚Äù replied Iximaz, dressed in loose tank top and tracksuit pants. She was sitting in the center of a chalk-drawn pentagram, surrounded by five lit red candles. She scratched her head, and the left side of her face twitched in a nervous spasm. ‚ÄúThe sooner we get this‚Ä¶ thing out the better. Seriously, why today of all days it had to ap-pear‚Ä¶ Ugh!‚Äù<br><br>She suddenly jerked her head back, and when she looked back at the two men before her, something has changed. Her left eye turned black, with a thin golden rim of the iris. Her lips twisted into unnaturally sultry grin. Her left hand moved slowly along the length of her hip. <br><br>‚ÄúUnless, of course, this is the perfect day to get‚Ä¶ freaky.‚Äù The Ixcubus licked his lips, before winking at Aegis. He then lazily turned towards Matt. ‚ÄúDo whatever you want, conjurer. I‚Äôm staying.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYeah, yeah‚Ä¶ Exorcizamus te‚Ä¶‚Äù Matt waved towards the pentagram circle, which caused the Ixcubus to yelp in pain, making the body to twist uncontrollably before falling flat motionlessly. <br><br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù Matt snapped towards Aegis, who was about to enter the circle to help his beloved. Time passed. When Iximaz regained control over her mind, she slowly got up, shook her head, and looked back at Matt.<br><br>‚ÄúSee? Doesn‚Äôt work,‚Äù she panted, wiping some sweat off her forehead. Her left eye returned to normal, and mouth didn‚Äôt feel like smiling.<br><br>‚ÄúSeems to be keeping it away for fifteen minutes,‚Äù added Aegis. He scratched his chin and stepped away from the circle. ‚ÄúSo it is working.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù Iximaz rolled her eyes, hugging her knees and putting her chin on top of them. ‚ÄúSo now all we have to do is make me listen to Sam and Dean performing excorcisms 24/7‚Ä¶ which would not be a bad thing, if only I was myself while listening to them.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat now? Come on, Matt, what else besides exorcisms would work?‚Äù Aegis walked over to the sorcerer‚Äôs work table, where all the books and old papers piled up. <br><br>Matt didn‚Äôt respond. He kept on turning the pages, looking from the book, to Iximaz, then at his vials filled with suspicious ingredients, then back at the book.<br><br>‚ÄúWe could cast it into something else‚Ä¶ or someone.‚Äù<br><br>Iximaz was the first one to pick up the meaning. She stood up and glared at Matt, anger building up with each word. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you even dare, dude. Not a chance!‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWho exactly do you have in mind?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAegis, no!‚Äù Iximaz clenched her fists. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not doing that! Next solution!‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWe could make a deal with him. He gets what he wants and hopefully agrees to let you go?‚Äù<br><br>Iximaz squinted. ‚ÄúNo, thanks,‚Äù she said dryly. ‚ÄúNext?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAt this point I‚Äôm honestly out of ideas‚Ä¶ I mean, nothing here looks like it might have any effect on our pesky intru‚Äî‚Äú Matt paused, before adjusting his glasses and leaning closer towards the book. ‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶ hello there.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Aegis and Iximaz asked simultaneously. <br><br>‚ÄúThis might work.‚Äù Matt mumbled to himself, closing the book. He grabbed a water bottle from under the desk and walked towards Iximaz. <br><br>‚ÄúSorry about that, dude.‚Äù He quickly dumped the contents of the bottle onto Iximaz, causing her to yelp quickly.<br><br>‚ÄúWhat the hell!?‚Äù she squealed, wiping the water from her eyes.<br><br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre about to cool this bastard‚Äôs lust.‚Äù Matt smiled. <br><br>‚ÄúCool his lust?‚Äù Aegis repeated. His eyes then widened and he smiled. ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ You want to lower the lust levels and basically starve the Ixcubus! Ha!‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúCute idea, sweetie, but my flame will never go out from such a silly spell.‚Äù The Ixcubus purred, coming dangerously close to the edge of the pentagram and looking Matt straight into the eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a little too‚Ä¶ round for my taste, but‚Ä¶ eh, I work with I get, babe~‚Äù<br><br>Matt rolled his eyes. He took a few steps back, rubbed his hands, took a deep breath, and held them above Iximaz‚Äôs head. <br><br>‚ÄúO, wielka Lilith, matko wszelkich demon√≥w! Na mocy kontraktu Salomona, wzywam Ciƒô do nas. Przez Tetragramaton, i na wszelkie imiona Pana, wzywam Twojego syna i TwojƒÖ c√≥rkƒô!‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄûUm‚Ä¶ I heard ‚ÄòLilith‚Äô in that chant, man. Are you sure it will work?‚Äù Aegis asked, but Matt remained deaf to his words. He wasn‚Äôt saying anything for a few minutes, before suddenly speaking up again:<br><br>‚ÄúZgadzam siƒô na warunki umowy. Biorƒô na siebie wszelkƒÖ odpowiedzialno≈õƒá, i wymagam aby≈õcie i wy przestrzegali zasad kontraktu.‚Äù<br><br>He walked over to the working table, where a small, long dagger bound in dark leather was placed. Matt quickly did a shallow cut on both his hands and returned to his previous spot. He let some blood drop onto the circle, right next to Iximaz‚Äôs feet. The candles went out, leaving a small desk lamp the only light source. Iximaz opened her eyes. It was her natural color. <br><br>‚ÄúDid it work?‚Äù Aegis asked.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ think so,‚Äù Iximaz said, examining her arms, and legs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel any different, though.‚Äù<br><br>She stepped out of the pentagram circle slowly, before quickly approaching Aegis and kissing him with all her passion. When she finally ended (out of need for air), both of them had very goofy grins.<br><br>‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Aegis whispered. ‚ÄúI think everything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, mate.‚Äù Matt flicked the light switch. They weren‚Äôt alone.<br><br>Two figures stood where Iximaz previously was. Both the same height as her, and dangerously similar in appearance, but some minor details were off. The one of the left had the Ixcubus‚Äôs golden eyes. He was definitely more masculine in his figure, with muscles visible under a thin t-shirt. Disheveled hair and light stubble only made him more appealing. He winked at Aegis, waving his finger in a beckoning manner. <br><br>The figure on the right had-similarly to the Ixcubus-black eyes with only thin rims of irises visible, although hers were deep red. This one was definitely a she; slender, with long legs and curves so perfectly outlined, it was almost unnatural. The shirt was nearly incapable of containing the pure abundance of her chest, and she was biting down on her finger, looking at the two before her in a seductive manner.<br><br>‚ÄúOkay, what the hell is going on?‚Äù Aegis looked at Matt, before being dragged into another kiss by Iximaz.<br><br>‚ÄúI made a deal.‚Äù Matt smiled, slowly backing himself towards the door. ‚ÄúSee, I thought both of you may enjoy a little more‚Ä¶ spicy time together, so I asked Lilith to send you some of her children to keep you company. And that sudden blast of lust? Well, that‚Äôs their doing. They‚Äôre gonna leave you alone, after rocking your world.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúMmmfmgff!‚Äù Aegis mumbled, before finally breaking the kiss. ‚ÄúYou did what!?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna‚Ä¶ mhh~‚Ä¶ kick your ass later, Matt.‚Äù Iximaz growled, before tracing her finger on Aegis‚Äôs chest.<br><br>‚ÄúHappy Valentine‚Äôs Day, you two.‚Äù The warlock laughed, before locking the door after himself. <br></p>

            <p>(Okay, so I&#39;ve played too much Wolfenstein 3D and every time I see Guardsman Tom&#39;s username, I think of the Guard enemy from the game. It furthers that thought that he has blond hair and blue eyes, so I just had to do this.)<br><br>Thoth was simultaneously surprised and not surprised that the badfic existed.<br><br>After all, he knew the nooks and crannies of the Internet well. He knew that many Doom fans liked to sabotage the Wolfenstein 3D fandom by promoting the assumption that Wolf 3D fans were all a bunch of Nazis. He knew that many kids of the average badficcer age were radicalized by the Internet and had become terrible edgelords, if they hadn&#39;t outright joined the alt-right. To be honest, he didn&#39;t care which group the author of this Legendary belonged to.<br><br>That didn&#39;t mean that he wasn&#39;t still shocked.<br><br>&quot;Of course it had to be him,&quot; muttered Thoth under his breath. &quot;There was no better guy to get Stu&#39;d. There was nothing that could make the fic more potent than that.&quot;<br><br>He continued walking down the hallways of Episode 3&#39;s Reichstag. &quot;And since he brutally murdered BJ Blazkowicz, it&#39;s up to me to bring down the entirety of the regime.&quot;<br><br>Thoth rounded a corner and spied a Guard watching him. Blond hair and blue eyes like the rest. He was about to raise his gun when the Guard suddenly started as if waking up from a dream, looked around in a panic, then lifted his hands up.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t shoot! Don&#39;t shoot!&quot;<br><br>Thoth approached the enemy. &quot;You can speak English?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah! Listen... I&#39;m not going to hurt you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why should I believe that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I- I know you. You&#39;re Thoth. I&#39;ve seen you on the Board.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What the hell...?&quot; Thoth looked at the Guard in confusion.<br><br>He extended his hand. &quot;I&#39;m Tom. The guy who got sent on this mission last time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I never heard about anyone going on this mission before, but okay.&quot; He shook Tom&#39;s hand.<br><br>&quot;Huh, hS never told you? Weird, I wonder what incentives he has to do that. Anyway, this is what happened. I was about to engage the Stu in combat when he looked at me with this hypnotizing stare... and then... I don&#39;t know what happened. I think I was brainwashed into working as a Guard this whole time, but for some reason, looking at you made me suddenly recover.&quot;<br><br>Thoth nodded. &quot;What about me would cause you to suddenly gain consciousness again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have no idea...&quot; A bead of sweat rolled down his face.<br><br>Thoth smiled a bit while he took note of that. Then he stopped. &quot;Wait. I think I killed a decoy that looked like someone I knew. That&#39;s bad.&quot;<br><br>Tom shook his head. &quot;There&#39;s been another? Wow. Huinesoron just won&#39;t rest until this mission is complete. Anyway, is there a way I can be of any help to you here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come with me. If we work together, it&#39;ll be easier to find and defeat the guy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Alright.&quot;<br><br>They continued walking, conversing, and laughing, pausing every so often to shoot other enemies, until they came to Floor 9. As they opened the elevator door, a chill went down Tom&#39;s spine.<br><br>&quot;Oohhh... I&#39;m terrified. This place just brings back so many memories.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, babe,&quot; Freudian-slipped Thoth, &quot;I&#39;ll protect you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...babe?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... I&#39;m gay, so...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh phew! That&#39;s great! My feelings aren&#39;t invalid after all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s what made you wake up. My hotness.&quot; He hair flipped.<br><br>They both doubled over laughing. Then Tom wiped his eyes and stood up. &quot;Listen, I know a good pushwall that we can hide behind and recuperate.&quot; He walked across to the end of the hallway and leaned on a painting. Thoth noted that the decoy that should&#39;ve been in the middle of the room was absent - it must have been the one he&#39;d killed.<br><br>In a nice clean manner that definitely isn&#39;t more substitution for the building of romantic chemistry, Thoth and Tom did nothing but talk and embrace as they sat by rows upon rows of health packs and ammo... when a figure walked in with swaying hips.<br><br>Tom was the first to spot her. &quot;That is one sultry decoy.&quot;<br><br>Thoth whipped around. &quot;Oh, she&#39;s not dead! Joy!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What a shame,&quot; purred the girl, light shining off her glasses. &quot;Someone&#39;s gotten into my storage. Could it be that you&#39;re the one who murdered all my boys?&quot; She took out a tube of black lipstick and began reapplying it, analagous to a certain feature of the male decoys and no doubt meant to evoke a similar state of fear.<br><br>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; whispered Tom.<br><br>&quot;Look, it is. It&#39;s Thoth! Do you need healing, boy?&quot; Then she turned to Tom and regained her smile. &quot;But you... I like you.&quot;<br><br>Thoth grabbed Tom&#39;s arm, eyes narrowed. &quot;Don&#39;t listen to her. It&#39;s Twistey, but she&#39;s fallen under the same spell you had.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do we want to kill her? I mean, it&#39;s thanks to her that we know all about this place that we do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re not going to kill her unless we absolutely have to.&quot; At that moment, the Twisteycoy put her hand on his shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Alright.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Be careful!&quot; Thoth clenched his teeth, pointing to what was going on.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, babe, I&#39;ve got this handled.&quot; He turned to the Twisteycoy. &quot;If your heart was true, you would not be acting this way. Besides, no way I&#39;m not going to be faithful to Thoth.&quot;<br><br>She took her hand off and grinned maniacally. &quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m faithful too. Don&#39;t take it personally, they kill gay people here, and while I don&#39;t really subscribe to that, I know I&#39;ll be greatly rewarded if I finish you off.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You dirty, dirty girl,&quot; muttered Thoth, &quot;you&#39;re breaking your own rules.&quot;<br><br>Tom shrugged. &quot;Brainwashed, remember?&quot;<br><br>She blinked, and in that instant her eyes became solid black. Tom felt a burning sensation as she slowly began to conjure twin fireballs into existence in her hands.<br><br>Thoth frantically looked at his new lover. &quot;Run!&quot;<br><br>Hand in hand, they made a mad dash for the door.<br><br>Maniacally laughing, the strange Twistey-creature levitated into the air and began flying down the hallway after them. Floor 9 being the small floor that it was, they didn&#39;t have too many places to go, and were soon cornered inside a hallway. Twistey blocked two of the three doors, but they knew there was a far worse enemy waiting behind the third one.<br><br>Standing back to back, Thoth pulled out his chain gun and Tom pulled out his pistol.<br><br>&quot;You sure this isn&#39;t going to kill her?&quot; questioned Tom.<br><br>&quot;I used this very same gun to &#39;kill&#39; her the first time and she only passed out,&quot; replied Thoth. &quot;Fire away!&quot;<br><br>BANG, BANG, BANG went the pistol.<br>RATATATATATATATATATAT went the chain gun.<br><br>The pair dodged fireballs left and right, in a way that definitely isn&#39;t because I&#39;m too lazy to write a proper action scene, and soon Twistey lay down on the floor unconscious again.<br><br>&quot;Whew,&quot; breathed Tom, wiping his forehead with the sleeve of his uniform. &quot;That was insane.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am... exhausted,&quot; said Thoth. &quot;But... oh God. I just remembered. This isn&#39;t over yet. We&#39;re not safe yet.&quot;<br><br>As if on cue...<br>CLANK... CLANK... CLANK...<br><br>Tom jumped. &quot;You&#39;re right! But what do I do, I only have my pistol!&quot;<br><br>Thoth thought for a bit as the footsteps slowly approached. &quot;You take Twistey back to HQ. She won&#39;t do any damage under Huinesoron&#39;s watchful eyes. I&#39;ll fight this horror alone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You sure you want to-&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s about to come through the door! GO!&quot;<br><br>Tom took the unconscious body onto his shoulder and bolted for the elevator door. Perhaps, he thought, if Thoth broke my curse, then we can find some Lust Object for Twistey who will break hers. &quot;Take care,&quot; he whispered under his breath.<br><br>Thoth stood ready on the opposite end of the hallway as the Gary Stu approached him. He watched it off the reflective surface of his watch to avoid looking into its eyes. It paused before the two doors that led out. Then it spoke.<br><br>&quot;Zhoth. Don&#39;t make zis boring. I have an offer for you. You have ten seconds to get a headstart running.&quot;<br><br>Thoth said nothing, but aimed his chain gun.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t even try. I am unstoppable... and I sense that somevere in your mind, you know zat.&quot;<br><br>Thoth muttered something under his breath.<br><br>&quot;I guess I&#39;ll begin counting. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five...&quot;<br><br>Thoth squinted his eyes closed and ran forwards in a blur, screaming a battle cry and opening fire. Nothing seemed to be happening from what he was gathering with his other four senses. On instinct, he blinked open his eyes to see what was going on, and then... it was too late.<br><br>Thoth&#39;s grip on his gun began to slip. Every muscle started to freeze. He fell to the ground. Everything went black...<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;Give me two seconds and she&#39;ll be sober.&quot; Huinesoron extended a flat hand to the girl&#39;s face.<br><br>&quot;No! No, that&#39;s not the right way to go,&quot; yelped Tom. &quot;I fear that&#39;s not going to work.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then what&#39;s your theory?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, so my brainwashing was undone by Thoth, and he&#39;s hot, so we need to find her an LO that will make that work.&quot;<br><br>The British man brought his hands up to squeeze his face. &quot;Are you and Thoth in love now?! Awwww!&quot; Then he regained his composure. &quot;This won&#39;t be too hard. She has many Lust Objects.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Most of them are villains or antiheroes, though, and I have another hunch that that won&#39;t work either.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh dear...&quot; He sighed, then checked his watch. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t Thoth be here by now if he killed our target?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, he should... oh. Oh.&quot; Tom almost dropped Twistey in despair. &quot;This only means one thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Tom. He rescued you, now it&#39;s your turn to rescue him.&quot;<br><br>Tom handed Twistey to Huinesoron, then stood up straight. &quot;I absolutely will do that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not dressed like a Nazi you won&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>Tom slapped himself. &quot;Hey, think of it as infiltration.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re getting too used to that uniform.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huineso-&quot;<br><br>The oldbie held up a finger leading to the Response Centers. &quot;GO, Tom.&quot;<br><br>And so, Tom went, strategizing as he went about how to save Thoth.<br><br>To be continued...<br><br>----<br>Will Tom save Thoth from the terrible influence of *ahem* a particularly nasty Gary Stu?<br>Will he meet others who have met the same fate along the way?<br>Will Huinesoron find someone for Twistey?<br><br>Okay, that last question is up to you guys, per shipfest rules, but as for the rest of them, find out in...<br><br>Man on a Mission - Part 2!<br><br>-Twistey<br><br>P.S. Tom and Thoth&#39;s love theme:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV1-AjwDJwM"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV1-AjwDJwM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV1-AjwDJwM</a></a></p>

            <p>Huinesoron brooded.<br><br>Huinesoron brooded quite a lot: every evening he brooded over what to watch on the television, what to eat for dinner, and whether he had time for a quick brooding session before bed. His preferred brooding attire was his black cloak, which he thought framed his cheekbones very nicely indeed. On this occasion, he was wearing it over a black tunic and black trousers, to achieve the proper brooding ambience.<br><br>The door to his office swung open, and Kaitlyn strolled in. She was wearing a corset - not as part of an evil-villainess-slash-dominatrix outfit or anything, she just liked corsets. &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; she said, stopping short of the desk. &quot;I know that look.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron sighed deeply (an excellent addition to any brooding activity) and looked up. &quot;Hello, my love.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hi yourself.&quot; Kaitlyn crossed the remaining space and perched on the edge of the desk. &quot;What&#39;cha brooding about?&quot;<br><br>The British elf sighed again and waved a hand at the sofa. &quot;Her.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn scrutinized the unconscious form of Twistey. &quot;Hmm. Another one of your failed missions?&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron quirked an eyebrow. &quot;I assumed you&#39;d make some kind of joke about her being passed out on my settee.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn snorted and rolled her eyes. &quot;That would hardly be an appropriate joke... so what&#39;s the problem with this one? There must be a problem; you don&#39;t normally sulk at work.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not <i>sulki-</i>&quot; Huinesoron cut himself off. &quot;Apparently she won&#39;t snap out of her brainwashing - oh, yeah, she&#39;s been magically brainwashed - until we find a Lust Object for her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, that&#39;s it?&quot; Kaitlyn rubbed her hands together briskly. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t be too hard. What about Zingenmir?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think she&#39;s gone on a trip with Novastorme.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Delta, then?&quot; Kaitlyn frowned. &quot;Or Juliette; I&#39;ve never been sure which-&quot;<br><br>&quot;She and Tomash were going to &#39;work on the network permissions&#39;.&quot; Huinesoron glanced at his computer. &quot;Since we don&#39;t <i>have</i> a network right now, I figure they&#39;ll be a while.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Heh.&quot; Kaitlyn pursed her lips. &quot;Alleb, then? I <i>know</i> she&#39;s free.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you <i>met</i> Alleb? She&#39;d never go for it. And anyway, I think-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, Nesh certainly will-&quot;<br><br>&quot;-that Twistey&#39;s actually straight.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn stopped staring at him. &quot;Well, what&#39;s the point of that, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You see my problem,&quot; the elf murmured. &quot;I&#39;ve been scouring my board for a solution...&quot; He waved at the cork-board behind him, which was covered in photographs, pieces of string, and random scraps of paper.<br><br>Kaitlyn eyed the setup. &quot;You&#39;re about to explain this all to me, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron beamed. &quot;<i>Well</i>, red string links people I know have been in a relationship at some point; blue is people I&#39;m pretty sure won&#39;t ever hook up. Then the pin colour says what sort of relationship they had, so pink is romantic, yellow is love/hate, black is-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes, all <i>right</i>.&quot; Kaitlyn hopped down from the desk and walked round to study the board. &quot;So... looking at this, it seems she&#39;s already got a bit of a thing going with Voyd, right? Why not just get them back together?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah. About that.&quot; Huinesoron turned to the unpowered computer, caught himself halfway. &quot;Perhaps it&#39;s best if I just show you... come on, give me a hand with her.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Twistey (not that she knew she was Twistey at that moment) came to in a brick-lined, grey-floored, and extremely rectangular corridor. She got to her feet with a jerky motion, like a puppet with one too few strings, and looked around. There was nothing of note nearby, so - without even a shrug - she set off down the hallway.<br><br>A few corners later, she came to something that was <i>definitely</i> of note. The wall in front of her simply did not fit with the rest of her surroundings: it cut the corridor at an angle, was shot through with glowing green lights, and most alarmingly of all, appeared to be rendered in realistic graphics.<br><br>Deep in Twistey&#39;s brain, the small part of her that was still <i>her</i> realised that this wall could not be dealt with by the standard NPC interactions (being: A, shoot it, or B, ignore it). She was going to have to do something... <i>different</i>.<br><br>She stepped closer. &quot;... hello?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hello?&quot; The voice that came back was extremely faint, almost blocked by the wall. &quot;Is someone there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, hi there...&quot; But that was the decoy talking, turning her voice into a low purr. Twistey shook herself and tried again. &quot;Hi! Are you... I mean, who&#39;s that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s... is that you, Twistey?&quot; The voice was stronger now, recognisable as Voyd despite the distortion of the wall. &quot;What&#39;s going on? I was... hS sent me on a mission, and then I got trapped behind this... this massive red firewall.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot; Twistey looked closer at the wall in front of her. It was most definitely green. &quot;I think there might be <i>two</i> of them between us. It feels...&quot; She frowned, rubbing at her eyes with one hand. &quot;Familiar, somehow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can you get me out?&quot; Voyd pleaded. &quot;There must be some sort of control - a button or a lever or, I don&#39;t know, anything.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll see...&quot; But the moment was passing. Now that she knew there was nothing behind the wall that she needed to shoot, the decoy was quite willing to file it under category B, &#39;ignore&#39;. Twistey&#39;s mind slipped away, and the brainwashing was back in control. &quot;... you some other time, lover,&quot; she purred, and strolled away, leaving Voyd to hammer helplessly at the wall.<br><br>Behind her, Huinesoron slipped off the invisibility cloak that had been covering him and Kaitlyn. &quot;You see?&quot; he said. &quot;The Fun Control Walls don&#39;t bring them together - they divide them. And without the physical proximity to her lust object...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I saw.&quot; Kaitlyn pushed her hair back from her face. &quot;Back to the office, then? I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be <i>something</i> on the board to help.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Huinesoron gazed after Twistey&#39;s departing form. &quot;Uh... do you think she&#39;ll be okay here? I don&#39;t much fancy trying to knock her out myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Kaitlyn slipped her hand through the crook of his elbow. &quot;Come on - the sooner we sort this, the sooner we can head home...&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I&#39;m not sure this really came out as a shipfic? Ah, well, brooding.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Reasons I like this:<br><br>1. You managed to turn yourself from Anti-Nazi Huinesoron to Emo Huinesoron. Now Emo Huinesoron is my new favorite flavor of Boarder OOC, because it&#39;s funny and slightly Kylo Ren. (Yeah... the former flavor is in fact my way of coping for the Incident way back.)<br><br>2. You saw what I was going for with the strength of the powers of *ahem* the particularly nasty Stu.<br><br>3. You made the Fun Control walls literal. That&#39;s funny. And... I don&#39;t know what kind of fun they prevent now that they&#39;re literal. Is your mind in the gutter too? Likely not.<br><br>4. Continuing the earlier joke about a need for femslash.

            <p>There was a knock on Neshomeh&#39;s door. Footsteps could be heard from inside the house for a moment, and then Nesh called out &quot;Who is it?&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Uh, it&#39;s- it&#39;s Thoth.&quot; said Thoth.<br><br>Neshomeh opened the door. &quot;Oh, hey! It&#39;s nice to see you could make it over here! Come on in!&quot; she said, smiling and opening the door wide.<br><br>Thoth stepped in, and Nesh got a better look at him. &quot;Why are you wearing that black leather outfit? It&#39;s really skimpy, and it&#39;s pretty cold up here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, you&#39;d taught me a lot about writing when we were doing our mission, and I thought you could, maybe, teach me about, well, other stuff. Like, um, y&#39;know, ...&quot; Thoth waved his hands around.<br><br>&quot;You mean sex?&quot; Nesh asked.<br><br>Thoth blushed. &quot;Y-y-y-eah. That.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That outfit implies you&#39;re after an ambitious curriculum.&quot; Nesh said. &quot;Then again, you did such a good job with the writing, you could probably handle my mentorship.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, thank you so much!&quot; Thoth squealed.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Thoth.&quot; Nesh said. Then, she thought for a moment, &quot;Hold on, aren&#39;t you into guys?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um, yeah, but I thought I&#39;d branch out a bit.&quot; Thoth said. &quot;Maybe Phobos could help out a bit?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good point.&quot; replied Nesh. &quot;Threesomes are very educational. And he won&#39;t be home until later, so I&#39;ll have time to go over the basics.&quot;<br><br>Thoth stood still and looked around. &quot;So ... what do we do now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, first, you&#39;re going to follow me to the bedroom.&quot; Nesh said. Then, her voice became more sensual &quot;And then, I&#39;m going to show you how to properly get <em>out</em> of that black leather.&quot;<br><br>The two Boarders then disappeared into the depths of Neshomeh&#39;s house, and had a very ... educational ... day.<br><br>And night (especially after Phobos got home).<br><br>And then another day.<br><br>And another night.<br><br>And then, on the third day, the neighbors came over to complain about the noise, so the lessons had to be postponed until the following weekend.<br><br>(( Since no one else had written it yet -Tomash ))</p>

What set?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best part.‚Äù Thoth grinned. ‚ÄúThese are from Unrealized. It‚Äôs an un-set consisting of cards that don‚Äôt exist.

Are you in?‚Äù<br><br>The other boarder shrugged, pulling up a chair to the table. ‚ÄúSure!‚Äù He looked around the lounge. ‚ÄúIs anyone else gonna play?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúActually, I might.‚Äù Another player strolled over.<br><br>Thoth wrinkled his brow. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThoth, that‚Äôs AC.‚Äù Granz said. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ I guess you two haven‚Äôt really met, have you‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh, AC!‚Äù Thoth looked down. ‚ÄúSorry I didn‚Äôt recognize you‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>AC gave a genial shrug. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.

Phobos was in the lead on lifecount, but there wasn‚Äôt a man who had 5 life left. And it was Granz‚Äôs turn. He blushed, his tone extremely apologetic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ really sorry about this‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know what else to play‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Thoth looked at him. ‚ÄúWhatever, man! It‚Äôs fine! What‚Äôs the issue?‚Äù<br><br>Granz just blushed harder. ‚ÄúDo you mind if things get a bit‚Ä¶ Not Safe For Work around here?‚Äù<br><br>The table was dead silent for a moment.<br><br>‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm cool with that,‚Äù said AC. ‚ÄúAssuming nobody else minds‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Thoth did his best to conceal a mischievous grin. ‚ÄúWeelll‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm certainly not complaining‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Phobos shrugged. ‚ÄúWhy not? It‚Äôs shipfest, after all‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>At the other players approval, Granz regained a bit of his composure. ‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù he said, his voice taking on a silky, smooth tone. He was clearly savouring the moment as he tapped the last of his lands. ‚ÄúI summon‚Ä¶‚Äù He played his card, and everyone crowded in to get a proper look.<br><br><blockquote>
<br><b>Daring Incubus {2RR}</b><br><b>Creature-Animal of Desire</b><br>When Incubus is summoned, all other players must perform a sexual act with the player who summoned Incubus, or lose five life.<br><i>‚ÄúYou dare to summon me?

<br><br>For a moment, there was dead silence around the table. Then Phobos broke it. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ this will be interesting‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>AC just glanced around the table eagerly.<br><br>‚ÄúSo,‚Äù said Thoth, not even bothering to conceal his grin. ‚ÄúWho starts?‚Äù<br></p>

            <p>I was actually writing a shipfic as this was being posted this morning. So this fic was actually more meta than even Thoth knew!<br><br>(No, it&#39;s not a Boarder shipfic. Different &#39;fic game.)<br><br>I quite like this, though.

            <p>Kaitlyn frowned, tapping her pencil on her clipboard. &quot;Do you know what this Shipfest is missing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Leather trousers,&quot; Zingenmir said. &quot;It&#39;s just not the same without them.&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen hS wearing them. Or <i>not</i> wearing them, as the case may be.&quot;<br><br>Twistey raised a hand hesitantly. &quot;Er‚Ä¶ is it memes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Kaitlyn said, smiling at her, &quot;but feel free to introduce them. I meant-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Corsets,&quot; Scapegrace muttered from her chair. &quot;I keep trying to fit them in, but I just can&#39;t make it work.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn flushed slightly and coughed. &quot;Not what I was thinking of. What we&#39;re missing‚Ä¶ is <i>femslash</i>.&quot;<br><br>The others considered this, and then Twistey raised her hand again. &quot;There was that thing with me and Calliope‚Ä¶&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace nodded along. &quot;And there&#39;s lots of slash-slash. Some of it involving fictional characters.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or sandwiches,&quot; Zingenmir added. &quot;Or was the sandwich female?&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh cleared her throat and adjusted her glasses. &quot;She has a point,&quot; she said. &quot;Femslash is a tradition here.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn nodded firmly. &quot;It&#39;s where it all started. The very first ships were girl-girl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; Twistey&#39;s hand rose again. &quot;I thought the first ship was you and hS.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn flicked a hand. &quot;Details, sliated.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which is a reference to TOS,&quot; Neshomeh murmured. &quot;I can probably look up the-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bjam/BiD,&quot; Kaitlyn said hurriedly. &quot;Andy/Saphie. Jay/Acacia.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kaitlyn/Thalia Weaver?&quot; Neshomeh suggested.<br><br>Flushing again, Kaitlyn shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t think that ever‚Ä¶ the point is, femslash: we need it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I mean, I&#39;m not <i>objecting</i>,&quot; Scapegrace said, &quot;but if I can&#39;t even manage to get corsets in, how are you going to organise this?&quot;<br><br>There was a <i>Pop!</i> of displaced air, and Voyd appeared on the table. &quot;I can help!&quot; he exclaimed as the plotters variously yelped (Kaitlyn), rolled their eyes (Scapegrace), or fell out of their chairs (Twistey).<br><br>&quot;Ah, Voyd,&quot; Neshomeh said, &quot;we&#39;re talking about <i>fem</i>slash. With ladies.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The clue is in the name,&quot; Zingenmir put in.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; Voyd scrambled to his feet and patted his (her?) chest. &quot;I&#39;ve been genderbent, see? So I can help!&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn frowned. &quot;Wait, are we talking gender or sex, here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;And does it even matter?&quot; Scapegrace asked. &quot;I vote no.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can look into the question,&quot; Neshomeh suggested. &quot;I&#39;ve got a survey I can adapt for the purpose.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s‚Ä¶ maybe we could stick to people who were female <i>before</i> the shipfest,&quot; Zingenmir said. &quot;You know, for the sake of simplicity.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aww.&quot; Voyd pouted. &quot;<i>Fine</i>. But see if I ever get myself genderbent for you again.&quot; With another <i>Pop!</i>, he was gone.<br><br>&quot;So if not Voyd,&quot; Twistey said after a moment, &quot;who <i>are</i> we going to fem, uh, ship?&quot;<br><br>The others looked at each other. Then, one by one, they turned their gazes on Twistey.<br><br>The relative newbie&#39;s face slowly coloured, reddening to the tips of her ears. &quot;Oh. No. Well‚Ä¶ no. No. Um. Weeeeeell‚Ä¶&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>(<a href="http://freakish_five.webs.com/hSKaitlyn.htm">Previously...</a>)<br><br>Kaitlyn Silverdust Moonstone sat alone upon a crystalline boulder, weeping softly. Her ankle-length ebony hair flowed like silk around her delicately-pointed ears, over her smoothly-curved shoulders, and down to mingle with the glinting snow on the ground. With each tender sob, a single tear welled in the corners of her almond-shaped lavender/cobalt eyes, caught the light, and rippled down her pale olive cheeks.<br><br>Her sorrow was so heart-breakingly deep that it seemed the whole world was affected by it: the bare trees leant in as if to shield her, the babbling of the silver stream was the sound of mourning, and even the birds cried out, &quot;Woe! Woe!&quot; Such was the tragedy of Kaitlyn: forsaken by her husband, forsaken by her mother&#39;s spirit (her midnight-black cat Moonlight with its piercing green eyes had vanished into shadow some years before, saying her task was done), with only the silver filigree of her elven owl-shaped amulet to remember them by.<br><br>Something moved in the gloomy woods: a mysterious figure, lithe and fast, hooded in black. Kaitlyn gasped and sat up, clutching her hands to her voluptuous bosom. Could it be? Could it really be? She stood, her bare feet making no mark in the snow, and pushed her luscious ebon hair back to reveal her clinging, flowing silver gown, tantalisingly low cut yet modest. &quot;Who is there?&quot; she called, in a voice like a nightingale at play.<br><br>The figure stopped, graceful as a unicorn. For a long moment there was silence, the air between the shadowy cloak and the glowing dress filled with tension. Then a deep, masculine voice rang out:<br><br><i>Oh, Galwyn was a shield-maiden<br>A shield-maiden was she,<br>A Rider&#39;s girl with hair of gold,<br>And eyes as blue as sea,<br><br>Forth Eorlingas!<br>For maidens short and tall<br>And maidens dark and maidens fair<br>The riders love them all!<br><br>She said would you come a-riding<br>Come riding out with me?<br>She was looking for a stallion,<br>And a stallion I be!<br><br>Forth Eorlingas!<br>For maidens short and tall<br>And maidens dark and maidens fair<br>The riders love them all!</i><br><br>Kaitlyn gasped, shock running through her like silver lightning, one slender coppery hand flying to cover her rich ruby lips. &quot;Can it be?&quot; she breathed, her almond-shaped lavender/cobalt eyes widening. &quot;Can it really be?&quot;<br><br>The dark figure lowered its head as if in acknowledgement, and stepped forward into the luminous moonlight. It held out a hand towards her, its fingers seemingly carved from pale ivory, and sang on:<br><br><i>So I rode her in the stables,<br>And left her wanting more,<br>I rode her in her chambers,<br>And on her bedroom floor!<br><br>Forth Eorlingas!<br>For maidens short and tall<br>And maidens dark and maidens fair<br>The riders love them all!<br><br>I told her to choose someone else,<br>But Galwyn was persistant,<br>And I finally surrendered,<br>For Galwyn has a sister!<br><br>Forth Eorlingas!<br>For maidens short and tall<br>And maidens dark and maidens fair<br>The riders love them all!</i><br><br>&quot;It must be!&quot; Kaitlyn Silverdust Moonstone ran across the snow. Her ebony hair flowed behind her like a tide, and all the colours of the aurora seemed to chase each other across her sleek silver dress as it rippled over the pure white field. &quot;My love!&quot; she cried, tears of joy tumbling from her bright eyes. &quot;You have returned!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have.&quot; The figure reached up and pushed back his cowl, revealing a pale, slender face, set with eyes the colour of garnets and lips as red as wine. &quot;After so many years, I have returned to you, fair Kaitlyn Silverdust Moonstone!&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn stumbled to a halt, her shapely arms still outstretched towards the handsome man standing before her. &quot;But... who are you?&quot; she asked in a voice like moonlight rainbows.<br><br>The man smiled, and reached up to touch his deep russett hair. &quot;You probably don&#39;t recognise me, because of the red hair, but it is I - Leto Haven. I come back to you, my love - and here you are, waiting for me still.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No...&quot; Kaitlyn let her hands fall as she studied Leto, bewilderment written across her beautiful face. Her almond-shaped eyes narrowed slightly, and her perfect lips set into a line. &quot;No,&quot; she said again, and behind her words Leto seemed to hear the rumble of distant thunder. &quot;You are not my love, Leto Haven. I wait on another.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I can be.&quot; Leto stepped forward, reaching for her with his muscular arm. &quot;My Lady, will you not give me a chance? There is none other here who loves you.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn Silverdust Moonstone&#39;s eyes flared, violet fire blossoming from their points. She drew her filigreed amulet from where it nestled in her bosom, and the same amethyst flames filled it with light. &quot;You had your warning,&quot; she said, the chill of the far north seeping into her voice. &quot;Now begone.&quot;<br><br>Leto started to say something, but the owl-amulet spread its wings, and a wave of purple light washed over him, and he was gone.<br><br>Kaitlyn let the amulet fall from her limp fingers, and fell to her knees in the snow. &quot;My love,&quot; she whispered, crystalline tears falling silently down her flushed olive cheeks. Her hair fell in ebon curtains around her, her silky dress blending into the snow. &quot;My love...&quot;<br><br>The snow crunched in front of her, and Kaitlyn forced herself to look up. Her gleaming almond-shaped lavender/cobalt eyes widened once more as she saw the tight leather trousers; the huge muscles rippling on the bare torso; and finally the steel-grey eyes set in a beautiful yet masculine face.<br><br>&quot;My love,&quot; said Huinesoron, holding out his manly hand to his wife. &quot;I am here.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p><i>The thing about corsetry is, well, you have to get into it.</i><br><br>Scapegrace sighed, leaned back. Her chair squeaked a bit. So did the rats.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t working. She couldn&#39;t get the scene right. Was this going to be serious, like the last two? Or would it be dumb fun, like the inexplicably popular Doktor Trollenfisch badfic? God forbid, there might even be <i>poetry</i> if she was really stuck for ideas.<br><br>And then there was the scene itself. It&#39;s BDSM, Jim, but not as we know it. For a start, writing basic BDSM softcore stuff just felt... tacky. Especially involving her friends, no matter what the context. That was the problem with sex-positivity, she thought, it ground you down with all the ways things could be. It was a good problem to have, sure, but applied to people she cared about in a non-romantic sense? Not worth the sleepless nights.<br><br>She swivelled in her chair, looked out across her living room, and sighed. &quot;Any of you lot got any ideas?&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh was too busy trying to cut hS out of his leather trousers to give an answer, and hS was too busy trying to retain some blood flow to his legs. Meanwhile, Phobos and Kaitlyn were fat too busy doing something utterly unspeakable with a caddy of loose leaf tea; a call tried to come up from Leto about them putting the ass in Assam, but it was muffled by the ballgag. Zingenmir said she&#39;d have a think about it later when she wasn&#39;t being sandwiched between Delta Juliette and an actual ham sandwich, and all that Tomash was allowed to say for the afternoon was &quot;Woof&quot;, which was really helpful. Calliope and Granz were busy gazing into each others eyes, which they were managing despite the blindfolds Thoth had obliged them to wear. Thoth, meanwhile, had been the victim of an unfortunate misspelling, as Twistey had gotten mixed up, crammed him into an Adepta Sororitas cosplay composed simultaneously of too much and a grossly insufficient amount of black latex, and left him on a date with a branch of Primark.<br><br>&quot;Fat lot of good you lot are,&quot; Scapegrace sighed, and turned back to her keyboard.</p>

            <p>The sky was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel, and Tomash was stumbling around the cold streets violently snogging himself. He was really going at it. He pawed at his own arms, grabbed at his own jacket and belt, flicked his own tongue out and twisted it about, left to right, in an attempt to wrap it around itself. <br><br>&#39;Oh, Tomash, you know how I love these cold cyber-afternoons,&#39; exclaimed Thoth, pulling his lips from themselves. <br><br>&#39;Oh, how could I not know, Thoth, my lover? You&#39;re <i>me</i>, after all.&#39; <br><br>&#39;How could you not,&#39; said Thoth wistfully, the subtext of his phrase understood almost immediately by Tomash because, again, they were the same person, literally the exact same person, same traits and tendencies and you should see them talking about computer nerd stuff together, it&#39;s <i>uncanny</i>. <br><br>&#39;Ah, but my darling,&#39; exclaimed Tomash or alternately Thoth, suddenly standing straight. &#39;Why, it&#39;s just about PPC-time!&#39; <br><br>&#39;Yes! Of course!&#39; realised either Thoth or Tomash. &#39;Quick! We must hurry back and log into our two separate accounts to continue pretending and claiming that we are two, distinct, different people, despite it being incredibly clear that <i>this is one person, sheeple! This is a single individual! Check the facts! Think a little!</i>&#39;<br><br>And so, Thoth and Tomash skipped merrily back to their cyber-computer - though not without, here and there, giving themselves light pecks on their own cheeks, or reaching over and gently massaging their own shoulders -<br> and everybody was none the wiser as to their dark secret. </p>

            <p>Calliope and Granz had long shared an RC, for reasons that were frankly blatantly obvious to anyone who had known then for any length of time. They were almost inseparable, and it had sometimes been theorized that they were, in fact, both one person - although if that was true, someone would probably have to start investigating the less likely link between Tomash and Thoth, Just In Case.<br><br>On this particular afternoon, Cal was leaning her injured arm against the console (normally, it would be in her brace, but unfortunately, said brace was being replaced after a remarkably unfortunate series of events involving Sue-blood, a carton of bananas, half a pack of ramen, a tire iron, some peanut butter, and one of Lore‚Äôs knives), waiting for Mikel to respond to a message she‚Äôd sent him. Granz was currently lying on his bed, fiddling with his phone, comfortably using Calliope‚Äôs fursuit as a pillow. Really, there should have been two consoles so Granz could have one to use, but DoSAT hadn‚Äôt gotten back to them, so they took turns on the one, and even that had a tendency to break down.<br><br>Which was why Calliope probably shouldn&#39;t have been quite so surprised when a spark jumped from the console to her wrist with a rather loud *BZZT* noise. The subsequent falling over, however, was an entirely appropriate reaction.<br><br>Granz jumped off the bed with exceptional speed, dashing the short distance almost instantly, speaking quite rapidly. ‚ÄúAre you hurt, did something happen, are you okay?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù said Cal. She frowned, flexing her injured wrist. Which appeared to‚Ä¶ not be, anymore. And her voice sounded... different.<br><br>‚Äú...um,‚Äù said Granz, having already realized what had happened. He turned a bright red. <br><br>‚ÄúDarling...‚Äù The young man on the floor looked at Granz quizzically. He ran his fingers through his hair, frowning as it only went as far as his shoulders. Then, understanding dawned. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù she - or rather, he - said. ‚ÄúWe should‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said Granz. He knew what Cal was talking about. He grabbed his phone and sent a call for repairs to DoSAT. He looked down at Cal. ‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre beautiful.‚Äù<br><br>Cal looked down at himself. ‚ÄúI am aware of this‚Ä¶ <i>darling</i>.‚Äù That last word, while not an uncommon phrase for Cal, had a different intonation than usual. It was more‚Ä¶ excited.<br><br>Granz bent down over Cal. He was flushed, and he also showed some‚Ä¶ other signs of excitement. ‚ÄúHow far do you want this to go?‚Äù he murmured huskily, tracing a line along Cal‚Äôs chest.<br><br>Calliope gave the man atop him his best seductive look - well, he tried to: He really wasn‚Äôt used to this body. Nonetheless, Granz found the result plenty appealing. ‚ÄúHowever far we want,‚Äù Cal said, his voice dropping to a husky whisper similar to Granz‚Äôs. He moved his hands up, along Granz‚Äôs body, feeling the skin and the bones, the muscle and tissue, the softness and hardnesses, and finally coming to rest, gently caressing the nipples upon Granz‚Äôs chest, eliciting a gasp from the man. Calliope leaned forward for a kiss and Granz gladly reciprocated, each tasting the other‚Äôs mouth as their tongues dueled passionately. They did, after all, have plenty of time. DoSAT took ages to respond and a broken console wasn‚Äôt high on their priority list.<br><br>Unfortunately, they hadn‚Äôt taken the Ironic Overpower into account.<br><br>‚ÄúDoSAT!‚Äù a voice squawked. ‚ÄúI have a report of a broken‚Ä¶ ahhh‚Ä¶‚Äù The man who had just walked into the RC was of above average height, rather stocky - to put it charitably - and astonishingly pale. Mostly noticeably, he had head of an Ibis. This was rather fortunate for him: Ibises weren‚Äôt capable of becoming flushed. Not visibly, anyways.<br><br>Calliope and Granz looked up. One of them was clearly more embarrassed than the other. ‚Äú...Thoth?‚Äù said Calliope slowly, ‚ÄúWhy are you‚Ä¶?‚Äù<br><br>Thoth - for it was Thoth - waved his hand. ‚ÄúYpsi. Accident. I don‚Äôt want to talk about it. Anyways, should I just‚Ä¶ leave you to it?‚Äù<br><br>Calliope grinned mischievously. ‚Äú...or‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe could make a little sandwich.‚Äù Granz seemed to squirm a bit.<br><br>Thoth, after taking a moment to thank every known deity for the wonders of loose-fitting pants, gave the both of them his best attempt at a level stare. Which wasn‚Äôt very good. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a very twisted person, Cal.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou say that like it‚Äôs a <i>bad</i> thing,‚Äù Cal responded in a singsong voice.<br><br>Thoth sighed. ‚ÄúIn any case, let me know when you want me to fix things.‚Äù He turned to go.<br><br>‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù Cal asked.<br><br>‚ÄúWhy would I enjoy that?‚Äù<br><br>Cal gave him a level stare.<br><br>‚ÄúB- T-THAT WAS DIFFERENT! AND ALSO A ONE TIME THING!‚Äù Thoth shouted - or rather tried to shout. It came out as more of a screech though the beak. The door closed behind him.<br><br>Cal and Granz began laughing as the door shut. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so evil!‚Äù Granz said.<br><br>Cal smiled at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an angel, I swear! The horns are only there to keep the halo straight.‚Äù<br><br>Granz leaned closer, pulling Calliope back into the kiss. Somewhere in HQ, Mikel finally tagged in, responding to Cal. But Cal was entirely too busy to care. And Thoth had just discovered that his RC was presently neighbors with the one Cal and Granz shared.<br><br>He had a creeping suspicion he wouldn‚Äôt be getting much sleep that night, ibis head or no‚Ä¶ <br><br>--<br><br>This was actually written for a challenge from Calliope. Ages ago. It&#39;s been slightly cleaned up, but it still meets the terms of that challenge. I think. Anyways, it was always intended to be published as part of the Shipfest. So here it is! My first ship of two actual boarders.</p>

With a handsome face and long, flowing blond hair. He wore a dark green robe wrapped loosely around him, exposing the strength of his muscular chest. ‚ÄúGreetings.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄòPlith gaped at the man. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúLion El‚ÄôJonson, Primarch of the Dark Angels, yes. I and my brothers heard tell of this ‚ÄòShipfest‚Äô, and decided to participate.‚Äù The Lion ducked into the small RC, ignoring the awed noises ‚ÄòPlith was making. ‚ÄúYou are my choice for tonight.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄòPlith‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúMe? B-b-but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ interested in‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Lion laughed, ‚ÄúOh?‚Äù He lifted ‚ÄòPlith, pressing the smaller man tight against him. ‚ÄúBut do you not feel the desire within you? To feel my touch? To experience my body pressing against yours? To feel the touch of my lips? If so, let such desire be released unto me.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄòPlith thought for a moment. Yes, this wasn‚Äôt his thing, but‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it was a primarch. It was different. And the Lion was his favorite‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, quietly. ‚ÄúI want‚Ä¶ this.‚Äù He pulled himself closer to meet the Primarch‚Äôs lips with his own, and the two came together in a passionate kiss.<br><br>~~<br><br>Hours later, ‚ÄòPlith found himself a the bar, staring blankly into the distance with a glass of Bleepka, trying desperately not to think about what had happened. He turned to the side, still staring vacantly, when he realized that Thoth was sitting next to him, with a thousand-yard stare to match his own.<br><br>‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ hey,‚Äù said ‚ÄòPlith, dully. ‚ÄúHow are you.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúPrimarch,‚Äù said Thoth, his tone matching. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSame. So‚Ä¶ VI or XVth? I can‚Äôt imagine it was any of the others...‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to discuss it. At all.‚Äù<br><br>The two sat in silence for a moment.<br><br>‚ÄúThoth?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI think you know what I‚Äôm going to say‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúCan I say it with you?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSure.‚Äù<br><br>The two of them spoke in quiet, exhausted unison. ‚ÄúLet us never speak of this again.‚Äù</p>

            <p>A very polite knock at the door roused Kaitlyn from contemplation of the next season&#39;s corset fashions. Upon answering, she found herself looking up at an exceedingly tall and captivating man. He was bald, but every centimeter of visible skin was tattooed with bright gold runic script. He had deep, soulful eyes in a face that was hard to describe, but seemed somehow familiar. He was dressed in pilgrim&#39;s robes of dove-gray, and carried a handful of palm leaves like a bouquet.<br><br>&quot;Hello,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you Kaitlyn?&quot;<br><br>&quot;For you, definitely,&quot; she said. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am Lorgar Aurelian, sometimes called the Urizen. I was told you were a priestess. I have come to worship you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Former priestess,&quot; Kaitlyn pointed out, &quot;and don&#39;t you mean &#39;worship <i>with</i> me&#39;?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I do not. I seek someone worthy of devotion. You, a former priestess, perhaps understand the joy in humility, the release in giving praise. Benevolent Kaitlyn, will you not receive my prayers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;How...&quot; Kaitlyn swallowed an inexplicable mouthful of drool, &quot;how would you go about worshipping me, exactly?&quot;<br><br>Lorgar blinked his lovely eyes. &quot;On my knees, of course.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn looked at him, then herself, and then the likeliest pieces of furniture in the room behind her. &quot;Maybe if I piled a bunch of pillows on the bed...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A most fitting altar.&quot; The Primarch smiled.<br><br>&quot;Well then. I guess you&#39;d better mosey on in, and bring your pilgrims to my holy shrine.&quot; She beckoned with one finger, and the Urizen followed.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>I did the other thing! I thought I&#39;d get more jokes out of the premise, but I think the point gets across. {= )<br><br>Sorry for giving you more robes to draw, hS.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>61516 hadn&#39;t been aware that there was such thing as regulation seductive-casual dress for Space Marines, but the way the towering figure in front of him wore the immaculately-pressed robe left no doubt that this was indeed the case. Decked out in pure blue and white, perfect from the cropped blonde of his hair to the smooth curves of his calves, the Primarch of the XIIIth Legion cut an imposingly appealing figure.<br><br>Or so 61516 thought as he gazed up at Roboute Guilliman. The Primarch towered in his doorway, but didn&#39;t speak a word - or move, or do anything other than stand, with an indefinable air of waiting.<br><br>Finally 61516 couldn&#39;t bear it any longer. &quot;Er... hi?&quot;<br><br>Guilliman nodded fractionally, as if expecting exactly that response. &quot;<i>Bonjour</i>,&quot; he said, his voice deep and resonant. &quot;Ah am Roboute Guilliman; tell me your name.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er,&quot; 61516 said again. It was one thing to read about the Primarch - it was entirely different to have him looming over you with an inexplicable French accent. &quot;I&#39;m... 61516?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, <i>oui</i>.&quot; Guilliman nodded gravely, as if ticking an item off on a mental checklist. Then, to 61516&#39;s perhaps-unreasonable surprise, he pulled out a clipboard and made an actual tick. &quot;A very logical name. Ah assume you &#39;ave sixty-one thousand, five &#39;undred and fifteen siblings.&quot;<br><br>61516 did not, in fact, have anything of the sort, but the Primarch didn&#39;t seem inclined to wait for an answer. Scrutinizing his clipboard, he gave a satisfied nod. &quot;Now it is time for you to tell me &#39;ow you feel.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er.&quot; 61516 looked around, but there was no escaping the bizarre conversation. &quot;... confused?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good.&quot; Another mark on the list. &quot;And ah am feeling satisfactory. Now.&quot; Guilliman placed the clipboard down on the table with a single, perfect <i>click</i>. &quot;This is, &#39;ow you say, the Shipfest. Ah &#39;ave selected you to be shipped with. You will &#39;ave a question.&quot;<br><br>61516 stared at him. &quot;... what?&quot;<br><br>For the first time, a frown creased the Primarch&#39;s brow. &quot;That is not the question,&quot; he said, glancing at his clipboard. &quot;Would you like another try? <i>Essayer a nouveau?</i>?&quot;<br><br>61516 stared at the giant figure. &quot;... why do you have a French accent?&quot;<br><br>Guilliman practically beamed. &quot;<i>That</i> is the right question.&quot;<br><br>61516 waited a few moments. &quot;... and?&quot;<br><br>Guilliman shrugged, stepped fully into the room, and pulled the door to. &quot;In matters of rrromance,&quot; he said, rolling the R to perfection, &quot;the <i>accent Francais</i> is required... by the book.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Because dangit, with a name like that he <i>has</i> to have a French accent, logic or no logic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><i>Dear diary,<br>I must write once again in your cold, unfeeling pages. Write of my pain, and my sorrow. Of the eternal, icy torment within my heart. Of the unyielding, unended torment and pain that will haunt me to the end of my days. Nevermore‚Ä¶</i><br><br>‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶ excuse me?‚Äù<br><br><i>Nevermore will I be free of my dark, secret shame. Of my incredible uberguilt.</i><br><br>‚ÄúHello?‚Äù<br><br><i>Nevermore will I be able to hide in the dark black hollows of my soul from my inescapable megatorment.</i><br><br>Iximaz tapped on the giant‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ anyone in there? Can I talk to them?‚Äù<br><br>The enormous man looked up, revealing a shock of dark hair contrasted by a face of pallid complexion, bearing an expression of intense concentration. ‚ÄúYes? What is it, mortal girl? Why do you disrupt my contemplation of my horrifying eternal torment and other things that are equally super-ill?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúUh.. sorry to disturb you,‚Äù muttered Ix quietly, blushing furiously. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve kind of‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre sitting in my angsting corner.‚Äù<br><br>The man blinked, and then sighed. ‚ÄúOh... yet another error to add to my ever-expanding list of folly, its black ink of inky blackness like an ever-expanding river of dark lamentations, struck by the moonlight of my eyes‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúN-n-no‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fine,‚Äù stammered Ix. ‚ÄúWe can just‚Ä¶ share it, or something. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs enough room, maybe if I‚Ä¶‚Äù But it seemed the man was, in fact, taking up all the space available. Thinking quickly, Ix sat on his enormous knee. ‚ÄúThere we go, see? We can both angst!‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù The man nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYes, mortal. Sit upon me, and contemplate your failings, as I contemplate mine. Together, we shall set forth upon the eternal path of atonement, never to succeed, ever to fail.‚Äù<br><br>Ix frowned. ‚ÄúUm. Okay‚Ä¶ Sure, why not. But‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI am Corvus Corax. Once, the primarch of the Raven Guard, but‚Ä¶ nevermore.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù Ix suppressed the urge to chuckle. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm Iximaz. Sorry, no fancy title or anything.‚Äù<br><br>Corax nodded. ‚ÄúNo matter. While you may not experience the depths of my eternal hyper-sorrow, we may join together, united‚Ä¶ in angst.‚Äù<br><br>Ix nodded. ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ united in angst.‚Äù<br><br>For a long moment, they paused, together, angsting in silent contemplation.<br><br>‚Äú...Corax?‚Äù said Ix, quietly. ‚ÄúI have a confession.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat is it, dear girl?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI was trying to angst, but then I started noticing‚Ä¶ I started looking at you. And how your hair contrasts with your skin, making you look wonderfully grim and brooding, as if you were about to become one with your angst. I am sorry.‚Äù<br><br>Corax looked down. ‚ÄúI must confess that I, too, have once again failed. I tried to angst, but I couldn‚Äôt stop paying attention to your beautiful face, how easily it fell into an expression of grim despair and hopelessness‚Ä¶ truly, you are the first mortal I have seen to angst so effortlessly.‚Äù<br><br>Ix turned a bright crimson. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre so angstily handsome. Can I kiss you?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes, sweet girl. Our fates are doomed, but I will allow you a kiss on this night. A kiss cementing matched desires born out of souls made twin in their incredible mega-sadness.‚Äù<br><br>Ix crept closer, pulling herself towards Corax. Angstily. Their lips touched in the most angsty way humanly possible, as she wrapped her arms around the angstiest man she had ever met.<br><br>Corax rose, carrying her. ‚ÄúWe shall now return to my castle of sadness. So that we may express our angst to one another more fully, sweet Iximaz.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes, Corax‚Ä¶‚Äù said Ix. ‚ÄúTogether, we shall be united to form one being. And that being will be angsty.‚Äù<br></p>

            <p>Huinesoron dragged his gaze away from the small pink fish bobbing in the middle of the pub. &quot;You know,&quot; he mused, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard a drinking song accompanied on the sousaphone before.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Thoth stared blankly at his latest drink, then shook himself slightly. &quot;At least Vulkan&#39;s got a good singing voice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Two good singing voices!&quot; Calliope chimed in. &quot;And Cat Nesh is awesome on the harmonies!&quot;<br><br>Just down the bar, Grundleplith slowly slumped down until his forehead hit the wood with a <i>thunk</i>. &quot;I just wanted a nice drink somewhere quiet.

            <p>Just before tea-time, there came a tremendous knock on the door to Phobos&#39; response center. He suddenly remembered: he had promised Neshomeh a date to make up for sharing her tea with Kaitlyn. But, he&#39;d been so busy building a deck for his latest MTG blog that he&#39;d clean forgotten! He rushed and put the kettle on, then ran to the door.<br><br>&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; he was going to say, when he saw that it wasn&#39;t Neshomeh at all.<br><br>It was a bald man about a foot taller than him, with coppery skin, and very bright eyes under his dark green hood. As soon as the door opened, he pushed inside, just as though he had been expected. He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg and said &quot;Alpharius, at your service!&quot; with a low bow.<br><br>&quot;Uh. I&#39;m Phobos. At yours?&quot; said Phobos, too surprised to ask questions for the moment. When the silence that followed became too uncomfortable, he added, &quot;I was gonna have some tea.&quot; He didn&#39;t add: <i>with my wife</i>. &quot;You want some?&quot;<br><br>He showed Alpharius in and had barely poured him a cup when there came an even louder knock.<br><br>&quot;&#39;Scuse me,&quot; said Phobos, and off he went to the door.<br><br>&quot;Here you are!&quot; he was going to say to Neshomeh this time. But it was not Neshomeh. Instead there was another man indistinguishable from the first, except that he wore a scarlet hood, and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited.<br><br>&quot;I see they have begun to arrive already,&quot; he said when he caught sight of Alpharius&#39; green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and &quot;Alpharius at your service,&quot; he said with his hand on his breast.<br><br>&quot;Thanks?&quot; said Phobos with a raised eyebrow. It was not the correct thing to say, but he was badly flustered. &quot;Come on in and have some tea, I guess?&quot; he managed to say after taking a deep breath.<br><br>&quot;A little beer would suit me better, if you have any, my good sir,&quot; said Alpharius with the red hood.<br><br>&quot;Nope, sorry. Can&#39;t stand the stuff,&quot; said Phobos. &quot;I might have some cider, though.&quot; He went off to the kitchen to look, and when he got back the two Alphariuses were talking at the table like old friends (in fact they were brothers). He plunked a cold can of cider in front of the second one, when a loud knock came at the door again, and then another knock.<br><br><i>Neshomeh for sure this time,</i> he thought. But it was not. It was two more men, both with blue hoods and otherwise indistinguishable from the first two. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open‚ÄîPhobos was hardly surprised this time.<br><br>&quot;Alpharius at your service!&quot; said the one. &quot;And Alpharius!&quot; added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.<br><br>&quot;Riiight,&quot; said Phobos.<br><br>&quot;Alpharius and Alpharius are here already, I see,&quot; said Alpharius. &quot;Let us join the throng!&quot;<br><br><i>Throng!</i> thought Phobos, wondering if there might end up being enough people for a quick draft of Magic. He had only just checked to see whether he had enough booster packs  for an eight-person draft with prizes when, <i>banga-banga-bang</i>, there was more pounding at his door.<br><br>&quot;Three people at the door?&quot; he said hopefully.<br><br>&quot;Some four, I should say by the sound,&quot; said the second blue-hood Alpharius. &quot;Besides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance.<br><br>Phobos shrugged. Nine people in a draft was a little awkward, but he could make it work. But it was not four after all: it was FIVE. Another huge bald man had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob before they were all inside, bowing and saying &quot;at your service&quot; one after the other. Alpharius, Alpharius, Alpharius, Alpharius, and Alpharius were their names (Phobos was not at all surprised at this point), and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their belts to join the others.<br><br><i>Okay,</i> thought Phobos, <i>ten-man draft. It sucks, but what can you do?</i> He rushed around for a while, getting drinks and snacks for everyone and putting out enough basic Lands and life counters to go around. He had just about gotten set up to play when there came yet another loud knock.<br><br>He scowled. Eleven people would be even worse than ten. He&#39;d have to split the draft into pods of six and five, and that was just dumb. Annoyed, he pulled the door open with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More bald men, four more! And there was another one behind, slightly taller than the others in a dark blue hood with a long gold tassel, laughing.<br><br>&quot;Carefully, carefully!&quot; he said. &quot;It is not like you, Phobos, to leave friends waiting on the doorstep, and then open the door like a pop-gun! I am Alpharius. Let me introduce Alpharius, Alpharius, Alpharius, and especially Alpharius!&quot;<br><br>&quot;At your service!&quot; said Alpharius, Alpharius, and Alpharius, standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Alpharius, the spitting image of the one in dark blue.<br><br>&quot;Of course you are,&quot; muttered Phobos.<br><br>&quot;Now we are all here!&quot; said Alpharius, looking at the row of hoods hanging on the pegs. &quot;Quite a merry gathering! Now we can begin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure!&quot; said Phobos. &quot;There&#39;s, what, fifteen total now, so that&#39;s a pod of eight and a pod of seven, not bad, not bad. I don&#39;t think I have enough packs for prizes, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have not come to draft,&quot; said Alpharius. &quot;I have come for your Shipfest! Will you not entertain the Hydra?&quot;<br><br>Phobos thought for a minute. He was, technically, still supposed to be having tea with his wife, but she was way late, and if she did turn up, well... that would make sixteen, and two perfect pods of eight.<br><br>&quot;Okay, I&#39;m down,&quot; said Phobos. &quot;Let&#39;s do this thing!&quot;<br><br>~~~~<br><br>Several hours later, the door to Rudi&#39;s opened once more, and Phobos staggered inside. His clothes were disheveled, his hair a mess, and his manly beard stuck out straight to the sides. He stood in the entrance, swaying slightly.<br><br>Neshomeh, who&#39;d been cavorting with Vulkan and Granz in the form of a winged tortoiseshell cat, abruptly morphed back when she spotted her husband. &quot;Oh man, I totally forgot our tea date! Crap, I&#39;m so...&quot; She noticed the glazed look in his eyes. &quot;Hey, what happened to you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; said Phobos. &quot;But I think I&#39;m Alpharius.&quot; He took one more step, tripped on a trailing leg of his jeans, and faceplanted onto the floor. There was a three-headed hydra brand on his left hip.<br><br><hr>
<br>With apologies to the great J.R.R. Tolkien. And also to hS; I have no idea how he&#39;s going to draw this one. {= )<br><br>Oh, and yes, Silly!RP!Neshomeh can turn into <a href="https://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Wynn-61030387">a flying cat</a>. Seemed like the right thing to do. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Tomash nodded, running his hands along the cold metal. ‚ÄúThese are, obviously, in immaculate condition. Why did you want me to look at them again, Mr‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúManus,‚Äù said Ferrus. ‚ÄúFerrus Manus.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAppropriate,‚Äù Tomash chuckled. ‚ÄúI mean, seeing as we‚Äôre looking at your hands, and they‚Äôre made of iron‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes, I get it‚Ä¶‚Äù Ferrus sighed. ‚ÄúDo you have any suggestions for improvement?‚Äù<br><br>Tomash shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, not really. None that I can think of. Although I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt entirely understand these things to begin with. Anyways‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ were you named after the Primarch Ferrus Manus, by any chance?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúUse your eyes, boy,‚Äù snapped Ferrus. ‚ÄúI <i>am</i> he.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh, right, right, that makes sense‚Ä¶‚Äù Tomash trailed off. ‚ÄúHow did you get in here?‚Äù<br><br>Ferrus waved a hand dismissively. ‚ÄúNot important. In any case, I wanted someone to examine my hands. They are, of course, perfect. But I wanted to check.‚Äù<br><br>Tomash shrugged. ‚ÄúSeem fine to me, anyways.‚Äù He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ Iron Hands, then? They‚Äôre pretty cool‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAre they, then?‚Äù Ferrus‚Äôs voice had developed a chilling calm.<br><br>‚ÄúYeah! All machine stuff and‚Äî‚Äù<br><br>Tomash was interrupted when Ferrus‚Äôs fist hit the table, causing him to jump back from the pile of wood that was once the table. ‚ÄúNo. What my sons have done is not ‚Äòcool‚Äô. It is entirely against the spirit of what I stood for when I was alive.‚Äù<br><br>‚Äú...Wait, really? You‚Äôre all about machine parts and stuff, right?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúIs my memory truly so desecrated?‚Äù Ferrus gave another weary sigh. ‚ÄúWhen I was alive, boy, I believed in the strength of the human flesh more than all else. Not machines. And yet my sons have become disgusted with the flesh‚Äôs very existence.‚Äù<br><br>Tomash nodded slowly, moving around to get closer to Ferrus. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I guess I can understand that. Sucks, really‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Manus nodded. ‚ÄúThat is the least of it.‚Äù He paused, briefly. ‚Äú...Apologies about your table.‚Äù<br><br>‚Äú‚ÄòS fine,‚Äù said Tomash. ‚ÄúThis is DoSAT. They break biweekly.‚Äù He looked the primarch up and down. ‚ÄúYou know, I think you could do with a hug.‚Äù He hugged the Primarch, although it was somewhat awkward due to the rather large difference in stature.<br><br>Ferrus looked down at the man. ‚Äú...You, boy, are very strange. But I think I like you.‚Äù<br><br>Tomash smiled at the giant. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ good! I think you‚Äôre pretty alright.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúBoy, I have been alone for a rather long time.‚Äù Ferrus smiled slowly. ‚ÄúPerhaps I should show you another way the flesh can be strong.‚Äù The words left no doubt what he intended.<br><br>‚Äú...You know‚Ä¶ I think I might like that,‚Äù said Tomash. ‚ÄúCome on. My room shouldn‚Äôt be too far away. Hopefully.‚Äù<br><br>--<br><br>Yes, I broke the name scheme. Because that was too strong name to pass on.<br><br>Also, if I&#39;m not mistaken, we have now officially shipped half the primarchs.</p>

            <p>Horvat was in the process of freaking the heck out. Which, to be fair, was an entirely reasonable reaction. ‚ÄúOhjeeznononononowhatareyoudoingherepleasedon‚Äôtkillmeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!‚Äù<br><br>The man outside his door kept a stony gaze upon him. ‚ÄúWhy do you believe I would wish to kill you?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNononononononon-wait, what?‚Äù Horvat stared at the giant. ‚ÄúYou are Perturabo, yes?‚Äù<br><br>Perturabo‚Äîfor Horvat‚Äôs assessment was indeed accurate‚Äînodded his head. ‚ÄúI take it you‚Äôve heard of me. But then‚Ä¶ it seems everyone has heard of my brilliance. For better or worse.‚Äù<br><br>‚Äú...Hang on.‚Äù Horvat thought for a moment. ‚ÄúHow did you end up here? Where do you live?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúTo be honest, I am not certain how I find myself in this place, whatever it may be. I believe this may be a first.‚Äù Perturabo nodded thoughtfully. ‚ÄúIn any case, I make my home upon the world of Olympia, as I have for as long as I can remember. I take it I am elsewhere.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúErmmm‚Ä¶ you could saaay that‚Ä¶‚Äù Horvat looked around. ‚ÄúWe can get you back, but first‚Ä¶ can you look at these?‚Äù He passed Perturabo a sheaf of papers, full of diagrams and drawings. ‚ÄúI would really like your opinion of them‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúFortification plans?‚Äù The Primarch glanced at the papers casually. ‚ÄùThese are appalling. Simple, easily penetrable. The result of a simple mind.‚Äù<br><br>Horvat flinched. When he next spoke, his words were quieter, more hesitant. ‚Äú...Then‚Ä¶ could you help me fix them, maybe?‚Äù<br><br>Perturabo snorted contemptuously. ‚ÄúWhy should I? All my life I am used as a weapon of war. And you wish me to continue to work for such a purpose when I am, for the first time, free? I will do no such thing.‚Äù<br><br>‚Äú...okay.‚Äù Horvat spoke in a small voice. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ before you go‚Ä¶ can I‚Ä¶ can I see your architectural designs?‚Äù<br><br>‚Äú...my <i>what</i>.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThe designs you made. The ideas for the magnificent cities and spires and cathedrals and their wonders. The most beautiful, brilliant designs.‚Äù Horvat trembled. ‚ÄúCan I see them?‚Äù<br><br>The primarch was overcome for a moment. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you actually want to see my designs? You want to witness my work?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúIn all my years‚Ä¶ nobody has ever cared enough to so much as ask.‚Äù Perturabo stepped into Horvat‚Äôs RC. ‚ÄúCome here, little one. Sit upon my lap, so that I may show you my designs.‚Äù<br><br>~~<br><br>Horvat curled up against Perturabo. ‚ÄúThose were <i>incredible</i>. Some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù<br><br>The Primarch smiled. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I do try to be the best.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶‚Äù Horvat snuggled in closer. ‚ÄúWe have the shipfest, right now‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ shipfest.‚Äù Perturabo‚Äôs brow wrinkled. ‚ÄúI have not heard of such a thing. How might I partake?‚Äù<br><br>The boarder‚Äôs eyes sparkled. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it would start‚Ä¶ like this.‚Äù He leaned forward, kissed Perturabo softly on the lips. ‚ÄúShall we continue?‚Äù<br><br>Perturabo was silent for a moment. ‚ÄúI believe I would enjoy that, yes.‚Äù<br><br>--<br><br>For those of you who didn&#39;t notice the (admittedly subtle) hints, this is a Perturabo from before he was found by the Emperor. Why did I do the ship like that? Because <i>after</i> he was found, he wound up turning into a total psychopath, and the challenge of writing that sort of thing will fall to whoever wants to do a ship with Angron. <br><br>Pre-Emperor Perturabo was arrogant and dangerous, but before he went off the deep end he was actually quite peaceable: He wanted people to live in harmony, preferred diplomacy to violence, and had many a grand ambition that was never to be realized, ignored by the war-obsessed around him. Also, he actually believed in the idea of democracy, IIRC. Although I may have gotten that wrong.<br><br>All of this is essentially the reverse of what Perturabo was to become, sadly...</p>

            <p>I admit my view is probably biased, because I&#39;ve now read the original Horus Heresy trilogy twice, and they&#39;re <i>very</i> pro-Horus. But yeah, I am absolutely open to capping off the images with Facepalming Horus. ^<em>^<br><br>So we only need seven more... you&#39;ve got Scape, and didn&#39;t you say you had An Idea for Kaitlyn? Other than that, let me see... checking your cowrite with Thoth [which I never read! Well, it happens that I&#39;m looking for a distraction right now, so up it comes!], it seems doctorlit at least recognised 40K when he sees it (he mentioned memes). Hieronymus doesn&#39;t specifically say that he <i>doesn&#39;t</i> recognise it, which sounds like Good Enough For Shipfic (also, he&#39;s been criminally left out of the Shipfest so far). And Hardric! He makes a 40K joke in his review!<br><br>See? That&#39;s five out of seven already. ^</em>^<br><br>(The reason I&#39;m angling for my wife to get included in this is partly because Agent Kaitlyn&#39;s reaction would be brilliant to read about, but mostly because I&#39;ve already got the first line of her epilogue written in my head. I would write it myself, but I don&#39;t have even the slightest grasp of any of the remaining Primarchs.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Which has made things somewhat patchy; they don&#39;t actually have <i>False Gods</i>, so for Lupercal&#39;s actual fall, I&#39;m relying on memories of reading it a decade back, plus references in later books (<i>A Thousand Sons</i> revisits it).<br><br>The patchiness continues throughout the series, which makes the repetitive nature of the series a godsend: I&#39;ve visited Isstvan at least three times so far, and I know I skipped another one.<br><br>Speaking of Isstvan!

            <p>Huinesoron had just finished logging a particularly fascinating pair of rocks when a knock came at his back door. He looked up in surprise, frowning. The back door didn&#39;t get much use, and he had no idea who could be calling there now. He got up and opened it.<br><br>&quot;Yes? Who‚Äîoh my stars.&quot;<br><br>He looked up‚Äîvery, very up‚Äîat the figure standing at his entrance. It was a man, but the most stunning form of a man he&#39;d ever seen. His alabaster skin, covered only by a flowing satin robe of purple and gold, gleamed with scented oil over taut muscles. His long hair was silver-white and held back from his forehead in delicate braids. His eyes were dark, sensual pools in a face that was almost unnaturally beautiful, accented by artistic dots of gold. A smirk played across his full, red lips.<br><br>&quot;Hello,&quot; said Fulgrim, the Phoenician, Primarch of the III Legion, the Emperor&#39;s Children. &quot;May I enter?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er.&quot; hS hastily cleared his throat, which had gone quite dry. He made way and gestured for the Primarch to come in. &quot;Of course. Please. To what do I owe the, er, the pleasure?&quot;<br><br>Fulgrim laughed, a delightful chuckle like water in a brook. &quot;Pleasure, indeed!&quot; He glided inside and ran his hands over the handsome Elven furnishings. Not as majestic as he was used to, perhaps, but charming in their own way. &quot;You see, my brothers and I heard of this Shipfest of yours, and I simply had to take part. You, as one of the‚Äîdo your people really call yourselves &#39;Eldar&#39;?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, Noldor, of House Finarfin, if you want to be precise,&quot; the Elf nattered, loosening his collar as Fulgrim fondled his rocks. Was it just him, or was it warm in here?<br><br>&quot;Whatever the particulars, it seems you are the most attractive, most nearly perfect specimen this dimension has to offer. Therefore, I have chosen you to be mine for the evening.&quot; Fulgrim turned with a radiant smile and grasped Huinesoron&#39;s chin delicately between thumb and forefinger. His nails were lacquered red and gold. &quot;I trust that will be acceptable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Meep,&quot; said hS. He nodded.<br><br>&quot;Excellent! Then let us begin.&quot; His voice dropped into a sensual purr. &quot;You&#39;re going to need these.&quot; From within his robe, he pulled out a silken cord, a riding crop, and a pair of feathered handcuffs.<br><br>hS gulped. &quot;For... for me?&quot;<br><br>Fulgrim laughed his enchanting laugh. &quot;No, my dear Elf. For <i>me</i>.&quot; He held out his hands.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>There, I did the thing. I&#39;m not sorry for any of it. *eg*<br><br>I think I&#39;ll let hS add his own epilogue if he wants to. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There was quite a crowd growing in Rudi&#39;s. Most of them looked up when Huinesoron appeared. The elf looked somewhat mussed (for an elf, which is to say, his hair and clothes were only inhumanly well-set-out, rather than perfect), and distinctly dazed.<br><br>Huinesoron clambered over the slagged remains of the door and staggered over to the bar, circling past the rambunctuous form of Vulkan on the way. He pulled up a seat next to Grundleplith. &quot;It may just be me,&quot; he announced in a dry voice, &quot;but I&#39;m detecting a certain... air of similarity around here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Primarchs,&quot; &#39;Plith and Thoth chorused.<br><br>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Huinesoron stared down at the countertop for a few moments. &quot;Which one&#39;s...&quot; He hesitated, brow furrowed. &quot;...the really beautiful one?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sounds like Fulgrim!&quot; Calliope scooted along the bar to join him. &quot;Hey, we&#39;re - well, mostly me now, Neshomeh ran off to play with Granz and Vulkan - starting a Primarch Appreciation Club. Wanna join?&quot;<br><br>The elf looked from her to the despairing pair on his other side, then over at the boisterous trio out in the middle of the room. &quot;You know what? Sure. I&#39;m into this.&quot;<br><br>-----<br><br>Well, it&#39;s a Shipfest. ;) And elves like pretty things.<br><br>I leave Team Vulkan&#39;s current activities to other minds than mine.

I will be watching for any more, though!)<br><br>My headcanon is that this whole thing is a weird shared dream had by our eponymous agents one night, possibly caused by a visiting psyker from the Shipverse; and also that they never speak of it again.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A knock sounded at the door to Thoth‚Äôs Response Center, leading the technician to stand and open said door. ‚ÄúHel--‚Äù<br><br>He paused at the sight of a hulking man outside his door. Hulking to the point of being absolutely inhuman. An inhumanly large man who promptly swept his way into the room, shaking out his roughly-braided blond mane as he went. ‚ÄúHello yourself, little one. You are Thoth, yes? I‚Äôm in the right room this time?‚Äù<br><br>The techie blinked and nodded. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yeah. Yeah, that‚Äôs me. And you‚Äôre--‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúLeman of the Russ,‚Äù the primarch interrupted with a nod. ‚ÄúMy brothers and I heard of this‚Ä¶ Shipfest, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù He waved a hand in dismissal. ‚ÄúRegardless, we have decided to take part. And you, little one, are my choice for the night.‚Äù<br><br>Thoth gaped in shock. ‚ÄúWha--but - but I‚Äôm - Russ, I‚Äôm - I‚Äôm honored, really, but I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Russ smiled down at him, an odd expression on that face. ‚ÄúYou mean the part where you chose my traitor brother‚Äôs army instead of my own?‚Äù he asked almost casually. He couldn‚Äôt quite disguise all of the barb in his voice.<br><br>Thoth took an instinctive step back, but knew better than to try hiding the truth from a primarch. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ yeah, actually. I mean, it came down to you two, but the Sons just‚Ä¶ felt like me more.‚Äù<br><br>The primarch of Legion VI grinned. ‚ÄúAnd that, little one, is exactly why I chose you. Either you learn the true glory of the Space Wolves, or I get to lord this over my brother for a millennium. Or both. Preferably both. What do you say?‚Äù<br><br>After a moment of shock, the technician began to laugh almost helplessly. ‚ÄúYou know what, Russ? Sure,‚Äù he said when he could finally breathe. ‚ÄúShow me what you‚Äôve got.‚Äù<br><br>~~~<br><br>Several hours later, Thoth trudged into Rudi&#39;s almost stiffly before gingerly sitting down at the bar. His eyes were dull and vacant, focused in rather than out, but he still recognized the man sitting next to him.<br><br>&quot;Uh... hey,&quot; &#39;Plith said dully. &quot;How are you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Primarch,&quot; the technician responded, tone equally exhausted. &quot;You?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Same. So‚Ä¶ VI or XVth? I can‚Äôt imagine it was any of the others...‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to discuss it. At all.‚Äù<br><br>The pair sat in silence for a moment or two before &#39;Plith broke it. &quot;Thoth?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think you know what I&#39;m going to say...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can I say it with you?&quot; He roused himself out of his lethargy by the smallest amount.<br><br>&quot;Sure.&quot;<br><br>And the, in quiet, dead-on-their-feet unison, they spoke. &quot;Let us never speak of this again.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>You&#39;re welcome, Birdie.

I don‚Äôt need to hear about whatever bizarre, probably gross thing you got up to.‚Äù<br><br>Cal sighed dramatically. ‚ÄúFine, then.‚Äù She took a seat. ‚ÄúAnyone up for chess?‚Äù<br><br>~~<br><br>Cal purred softly, curling up on Magnus‚Äô chest. ‚ÄúMm‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre right. This is exactly what I wanted.‚Äù<br><br>Magnus smiled, stroking her head posessively. ‚ÄúI know. I would have brought more, but‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThis is enough.‚Äù Cal poured over more of the books. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like these. It‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúIndeed it is.

            <p>Neshomeh had spent a long day in the archives. The shipfest was on, yeah, but, for the time being at least, she seemed to be out of its focus. As such, she was taking the opportunity to catch up on work. Like organizing the archives. And writing missions. And writing interludes that would be unpublishable until after the missions were published, when the missions wouldn‚Äôt be published until after she‚Äôd written them, which she hadn‚Äôt done, because she was too busy writing interludes.<br><br>Oh, and there was poetry and music writing mixed in as well. And all kinds of other work.<br><br>Eventually, all of this writing would get into the hands of her eager readers. And she <i>was</i> working furiously on it. It‚Äôs just that there was <i>so much of it</i> to work on all at once, and it seemed like everything took forever to get done. <br><br>But there were bright sides. It could be worse: at least she wasn‚Äôt like Thoth. That kid never seemed to even get <i>started</i> on anything of consequence.<br><br>Anyways, yes. She was making use of the downtime quite adequately. She‚Äôd even found another way to make more people think about Thoth (the agent) and Derik kissing passionately as they solemnly professed their love to one another. Nevermind how it was possible to confess love when your mouth was full of someone else‚Äôs tongue. There was enough impossible, unlikely, or just not-happening-in-this-timeline things happening in that scene that one more couldn‚Äôt hurt. This sort of thing was more Thoth‚Äôs game than hers, but she enjoyed it nonetheless. Besides, at least she didn‚Äôt tease the ship in the middle of other stories where it didn‚Äôt even make sense to do so.<br><br>The point was, she certainly wasn‚Äôt looking for any crazy shipfest shenanigans. As such, the Ironic Overpower would no doubt ensure shipfest shenanigans would come knocking.<br><br>There was a knock at the door. Apparently, the Ironic Overpower wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly subtle.<br><br>Neshomeh sighed, putting away her pen, and went to open it. ‚ÄúWho is-‚Äù She paused, gaping at the exceedingly large, exceedingly yellow figure before her.<br><br>‚ÄúGreetings.‚Äù said the man, his voice oddly‚Ä¶ flat? It was hard to say. ‚ÄúI Am Rogal Dorn.‚Äù<br><br>Nesh shook her head rapidly clear it. ‚ÄúThe primarch‚Ä¶ right. Come in, please.‚Äù<br><br>The giant entered the room, taking a seat upon the floor. ‚ÄúI Appreciate You Allowing Me To Enter Your Domicile, Mortal.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ welcome?‚Äù The formal speech threw the boarder slightly off-kilter, although it was easy for her to decipher it. ‚ÄúSo why are you here?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI Have Come To Participate In This Festival Of Ships. But I See No Ships. Only People.‚Äù<br><br>Nesh gave a small laugh. This was definitely TTS!Dorn. ‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ wrong sort of ship‚Ä¶ this is a festival for‚Ä¶ relationships.‚Äù Having grown more comfortable, she took in her visitor more fully. His yellow robe did little to hide the strength of his enormous frame. His close-cut grey hair nicely emphasized the definition of his face. And his moustache‚Ä¶ Well, it was a very sexy moustache. <i>Very</i> sexy. Nesh didn‚Äôt think Dorn was supposed to have a moustache, but if the moustache was going to be this sexy, she didn‚Äôt mind.<br><br>‚ÄúI See. Would You Like To Partake In A Relationship With Me?‚Äù Dorn‚Äôs monotone made it hard to make out the question, but it was there.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù Nesh blinked. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThis Is A Relationship Festival.‚Äù Dorn‚Äôs monotone become noticeably deeper, throatier, and sexier, while also remaining exactly the same. ‚ÄúAnd You Have Caused Me To Become Extremely Aroused.‚Äù<br><br>Nesh smiled, maneuvering herself onto Dorn‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I suppose it could be enjoyable to have some fun with you‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI Agree That Copulation May Provide Mutual Pleasure.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Nesh moved her hand up Dorn‚Äôs body to caress his moustache.

            <p>I actually envisioned 30k!Magnus while writing it, but I wasn&#39;t properly doing the character at all (partly on purpose because shipfest, partly because it&#39;s been awhile).

            <p>The bar was quiet. The dented digital jukebox hanging off a pillar had finally run out of dull piano ballads. The few regulars still left were sat dozing in a corner like piles of old coats. The barman&#39;s sole real customer was slumped on the counter, blonde hair scraped back away from her face. The peach schnapps was running low. There wasn&#39;t much call for it in rural Indiana.<br><br>&quot;This seat taken?&quot;<br><br>The blonde gave the speaker a quick look, a soldier&#39;s look or something like it. Then she looked away.<br><br>The speaker sat down. Rake thin, long-limbed like a teenager or an underfed German Shepherd. Short brown hair, the fringe flicked away with a twist of the neck. &quot;You know, we&#39;ve met.&quot;<br><br><i>That</i> got a response. &quot;We have?&quot; The blonde&#39;s English was accented. German, maybe.<br><br>A nod. &quot;A while ago.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It would have to have been.&quot; A slim smile that tasted of bad spirits. &quot;A long, long while.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was worth knowing. A long, long while ago. Now?&quot; The blonde&#39;s gaze fixed on the new arrival like a stooping hawk. &quot;Now people have that Irish maniac, or the Lindholm girl. Now I have an empty glass.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s still a place for you.&quot;<br><br>One sharp laugh, a bark of a thing. The blonde looked away. &quot;I brought my whole team back from the dead once. Time after time after time. I helped so many people and now? What&#39;s left from those days? A bird with broken wings. Flight for a moment and crashing back down. A <i>gun</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t mean there.&quot;<br><br>The blonde&#39;s head snapped around. The brunet was just sat there, all angles and legs and battered green jacket, pointing at their heart.<br><br>&quot;I still main you,&quot; they continued. &quot;I never stopped. You have the best healing and you&#39;re the best pure support. So you can&#39;t rez a whole team any more. So what? You&#39;re <i>you</i>. And I want to help you remember that. Any way I can.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Any way?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Name it.&quot;<br><br>The blonde smiled, softer, quieter, more felt. &quot;Then buy me another drink and call me Angela.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ix,&quot; said Iximaz.<br><br>After an hour, they left together, and didn&#39;t look back.</p>

            <p>Tomash backed away from the mysterious, fascinating woman who had appeared in his apartment. &quot;Okaaaay, who are you?&quot;<br><br>The woman let out a laugh. &quot;Don&#39;t you know me, Tomash? Can&#39;t you tell me by my ability to check your borrows?&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Rust?&quot; Tomash shook his head rapidly. &quot;So you&#39;re an anthropomorphism of a programming language? What are you doing here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Upon evaluation, I respond with Conversation::Response::Boolean::Yes. As for what I&#39;m doing here... I&#39;ve taken a liking to you. I&#39;ve decided to get to onow you more... intimately. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m very safe. Unless you want to get... unsafe, of course.&quot;<br><br>Tomash blushed. &quot;But... but...&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what? Are my zero-cost abstractions and lovely enums not good enough for you?&quot; The woman slowly began to reveal more of herself. &quot;Off for another risky night with C? You know it&#39;s only a matter of time before you crash and burn... but with me... you can be safe forever. Don&#39;t you want that?&quot;<br><br>Tomash&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Y-yes...&quot;<br><br>The woman smiled wider. She held out a glowing collar. &quot;Here. Put this on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a tag, of course. It wraps you as a Person::Related. A Lover, specifically.&quot; She laughed, gently. &quot;What, did you think I&#39;d cast you? After all, I am big on safety.&quot;</p>

Her equally pink fingernails tapped against her mug and she pouted harder. &quot;And whenever I ask if he wants to hang out with me, he just sighs and starts talking about how good she looks with Elf ears!&quot; She looked up at Phobos, biting her plush pink lips. &quot;Do you think I&#39;d look better with Elf ears?&quot;<br><br>Phobos growled a deep manly growl and nibbled Kaitlyn&#39;s ear. &quot;I think you look sexy without them,&quot; he said, setting his tea aside before pulling her down on top of him.<br><br>Kaitlyn squealed as he wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her in for a kiss. &quot;But Phobie,&quot; she said, &quot;What about Neshomeh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What about her?&quot; Phobos said. &quot;She and Huinesoron are happy together, so why shouldn&#39;t we be happy together?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oooh, now there&#39;s a good point,&quot; Kaitlyn said as they kissed deeply.<br><br>* * *<br><br>&quot;Hey, do you ever think we&#39;re neglecting our spouses lately?&quot; Huinesoron asked as he and Neshomeh pulled off their scabbards, sweaty from another day of LARPing.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Neshomeh said dismissively. &quot;Wanna have sex?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Keep the Elf ears on,&quot; Huinesoron said as he tossed his cloak dramatically to the side.</p>

            <p>On the bottom floor of a particularly modernistic and snazzy mall, a long line of people had assembled in front of a deli venue. The hour was late, and there was twisted line, spanning the width of the venue and back more than three times; much like the lines at a baseball stadium. The sandwiches being baked here were of the highest quality; with such tastes that only the most skilled of connoisseurs could truly appreciate.<br><br> Larfen, a man of large statue, waited behind about eight or so people in line. He had been waiting for quite a while, and was practically salivating at the options. Tomatoes, lettuce, bacon, cheese, garlic, onions, and so many more options to choose from (not mentioning the 8 different types of bread!), he was truly in awe. Though undecided on the particulars, he was ready to consume a sandwich of the best quality. He had fallen in love with the concept of the sandwich, in the time he had spent waiting for one. He lusted after that savory combination of bread, and assorted toppings. He desired and ached for that sweet fullness and the tastes of bread on his tongue, and the feeling of being sated. <br><br>  Another five minutes passed, and a horrible, heartbreaking noise sounded through the crowd. The metallic clacking of steel shutters being pulled down by one of the deli employees. Larfen was third in line. The employee gave a terse, almost sarcastic apology, and quickly left. The people left in line were stunned. There was a silence, and an almost audible hunger that had been left unsatiated. <br><br>A noise emerged from Larfen‚Äôs lips. A deep moan, full of despair. He would never get to eat that sandwich, of which he had spent what had felt like his entire life waiting for. He had loved this sandwich so sillily, which hadn‚Äôt even been a single object, and now he had been punished for it. His hopes, his dreams, and his desires had been crushed as soon as the clack of the shutters had hit the ground. He moaned again, loud enough to gain the attention of his fellow patrons.<br>A man in a business suit gave Larfen a worried look.<br><br>Larfen was no longer on the plain of the living. He had descended into a realm of pure sadness. He mourned the death of his love. Worse, his love will never be created. His teeth pained, never to chew a sandwich. He imagined the soft, chewy bread, and the juices of the tomatoes on his tongue. He envisioned the oily, papery wrap surrounding and cocooning the sandwich. He released another deep, lusting moan. <br><br>   Needless to say, they were startled and concerned. But after a minute, another, deeper pitched moan sounded. Larfen‚Äôs moan had been received, and understood. This moan came from another, from deep within their heart and empty stomach. From somewhere else in the crowd, another moan had erupted. The message had been comprehended. Soon enough, a symphony of deep moans, full of lusting hunger, had begun. Those who were not moaning, began stifling giggles, but eventually even they were unable to contain their laughs.<br><br> Whenever there seemed to be an end to the moans, a pause or a break, another voice would clearly resound with a hearty, hungry moan. Two men, clad in black, with words written on their backs were approaching from a distance. The words written on their backs, in bright yellow, were ‚ÄúSECURITY STAFF.‚Äù They were disturbed, and unamused. ‚ÄúBreak it up, people‚Äù, one of the men yelled. The crowd was silenced, and once again returned to a neutral state. Some quiet laughing was heard, and the crowd broke up. Larfen, still hungry, turned away from his lost love, and saw a white, neon sign in the distance. It read, ‚ÄúDELI: OPEN 24/7‚Äù.<br><br>_____<br><br>Some liberties and ideas taken from Joseph Heller&#39;s &quot;Catch-22&quot;. <br>Hope you enjoyed.<br><br>- Maxewell<br></p>

            <p>The verbosity of the whole thing is, indeed, <i>very</i> Catch-22 and I could imagine an entire segment of that book being dedicated to sandwiches and people who really really want them. <br>And then the next chapter is about how the sandwich-maker eventually was horrifically bombed to pieces and how, through a bureaucratic mishap, is never reported dead to his family or some such. <br><br>Anyhow, it&#39;s a very accurate representation of the theoretical alternate reality in which Larfen is a man who likes sandwiches. Also, in which he is tall. </p>

            <p>On a warm, sunny day, a orange-furred, white-splotched kitten was curled up with a brown-furred puppy in a field somewhere.<br>The two were rather intertwined, with parts of one animal lying on top of the other and vice-versa.<br>Someone very close by could&#39;ve heard quiet, content breathing coming from both of them.<br><br>&lt;Hey, move over a bit?&gt;, said Calliope, who was currently the kitten, &lt;One of my paws is falling asleep.&gt;<br><br>Granz, who was, at the moment, a puppy, picked up his back half and moved it away from Cal, getting some pressure off of her.<br>He then gave her a quick lick on the forehead.<br><br>&lt;Think we should demorph? We&#39;ve been cuddling for a while now.&gt; Granz asked, worried.<br><br>Cal took her free paw and booped him on the snoot. &lt;Thoth just left to check a moment ago. We&#39;ll be <em>fine</em>.&gt;<br><br>Rather conveniently, Thoth, currently a raven, flutter-hopped out from a nearby bush.<br>(His flying skills weren&#39;t that great, especially when he was tired.)<br>&lt;We&#39;ve got about ten minutes left, and the coast is clear,&gt; he said. &lt;We should probably demorph in a moment. But first...&gt;.<br><br>When he reached Cal and Granz, Thoth spread his wings out and draped them over Cal and Granz, resting his head in a valley in the Cal-Granz cuddle.<br>Cal and Granz both raised their heads and nuzzled Thoth&#39;s wings.<br><br>&lt;This was nice.&gt; Cal said.<br><br>&lt;Yeah. We should definitely do this again.&gt; Thoth agreed.<br><br>&lt;This is great, yeah. But what if we get caught?&gt; Granz worried.<br>Cal simply booped his snoot again.<br><br>&lt;Let&#39;s split up&gt; said Thoth, removing his wings with a sigh.<br>Cal and Granz both brought themselves upright, which took a while because they kept getting tangled up in each other (and Thoth, at first) and sneaking in one last lick.<br><br>A few minutes later, the trio had managed to give each other some distance, and they demorphed.<br><br>&quot;You know what?&quot; said Cal, once everyone was human again. &quot;We could just ... keep cuddling.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok but what if...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Granz, we&#39;re in the middle of nowhere. No one&#39;s going to come by and interrupt.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I need to do all the computer stuff.&quot; objected Thoth.<br><br>&quot;You can do that later.&quot; said Cal.<br><br>&quot;Ok, fine.&quot; Thoth sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll join you for more snuggles.&quot;<br><br>And so, the now-human Floof Trio laid down on the grass, forming a pile of hugs, cuddles, and other physical gestures of affection.<br><br>(( A/N: Whether the Floof Trio were wearing clothes after they demorphed is left to each reader&#39;s personal interpretation. - Tomash ))<br></p>

            <p>Scapegrace paced around her kitchen counter, trying to look intimidating while wearing an apron and holding a butter knife.<br><br>&quot;You know, Larfen.&quot; she said to the ham sandwich on a plate she was orbiting around, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, that&#39;s a first, mate.&quot; said the sandwich, despite not having a mouth ... or any other obvious organs, for that matter.<br><br>Scape poked Larfen&#39;s bread with the knife, leaving a small dent. &quot;Food doesn&#39;t make snarky comments!&quot; she said sharply.<br><br>&quot;Yes, Mistress. Sorry, Mistress.&quot; Larf replied.<br><br>Scapegrace paused for a moment. &quot;Wait a minute, this is a PPC fic. It&#39;d be lame without snarky comments. So snark, but snark <em>respectfully</em>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes Mistress.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So anyway, I was thinking. The plan was that I&#39;d cut you up and eat you now that you&#39;ve been turned into a ham sandwich, but I had a better idea I&#39;d like to run past you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Go on.&quot; Larfen said, sounding excited.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve got a thing for corsets.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was pretty bloody obvious ma‚Äî Mistress.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I thought I&#39;d make a sandwich-sized corset. Then I&#39;d put it on you, and squish you up real good. Then I&#39;d work it up you so you&#39;d be much narrower and easier to eat. I wouldn&#39;t have to clean as much too. What do you think?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s ... actually a lot better idea than what I had when we decided to do this. I&#39;d like to be squished up, Mistress. Let&#39;s do it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be back then.&quot; Scape said, putting the knife back in a drawer. &quot;I&#39;ll need to make a corset that&#39;ll fit you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t run off now!&quot; she called out as she left the room, chuckling as she did so.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t have any legs, mate, I mean, Mistress.&quot; Larfen replied.<br><br>Scapegrace went off to her super-secret high-tech engineering complex, which is to say, the shed out back with all the robot parts in it. She spent most of the afternoon trying to figure out how to build a sandwich-sized corset, without much luck. Over the next few hours, the shed acquired a small pile of leather and plastic from Scape&#39;s attempts to build the thing she&#39;d need to give Larf a good time.<br><br>Scapegrace, of course, didn&#39;t ignore the sandwich she&#39;d left in the kitchen. She frequently came back there to make sure Larfen wasn&#39;t lonely, and sometimes to butter his bread or open him up and add mayonnaise.<br><br>Eventually, it was insanely late, even by Scape&#39;s standards. So, she gave up on the corset-making for the night, and went back to the kitchen. &quot;Ugh.&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize making a tiny corset would be this hard.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So the idea&#39;s off then?&quot;<br><br>Scape picked up her butter knife.<br><br>&quot;Mistress.&quot; Larfen added.<br><br>&quot;So sandwiches <em>can</em> learn.&quot; Scapegrace commented. &quot;If I don&#39;t think of anything by tomorrow morning, we&#39;re going with the original plan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shucks.&quot; said Larfen. &quot;It sounded like a lot of fun, Mistress.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It did, yeah.&quot; Scapegrace said. &quot;Now, I think you need some sleep too.&quot; Scapegrace took out a roll of plastic wrap, covered Larfen (and his plate) with it, and put him in the fridge so he wouldn&#39;t go bad overnight.<br><br>The next morning, around ten AM (Scape slept in), Scapegrace went to the kitchen and retrieved her sandwich from the fridge. She lovingly unwrapped Larfen and set him back down on the counter. &quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s pretty cold in there, Mistress.&quot; Larfen said.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a fridge. What&#39;d you expect?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good point.&quot; Larfen said. &quot;We still on for the corsets?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Probably not ... wait, hold on, I have an idea!&quot; Scapegrace ran out of the kitchen and went to her shed.<br><br>&quot;Aw, she didn&#39;t even jab me for that.&quot; lamented Larfen a bit after Scape had left.<br><br>Scapegrace worked furiously for just under two hours. Her fingers flew on the sewing machine, drills, and other DIY equipment she had accumulated. Scapegrace emerged triumphant with a bundle of cloth, plastic, rope, and any other components the author missed in his thirty seconds of research that could be used to give a ham sandwich a nice extreme corseting.<br><br>Scapegrace half-ran most of the way to the kitchen, then stopped. She gathered herself and strode in fiercely. She had an image to maintain in front of her eventual food, after all.<br><br>As Scapegrace stepped into the kitchen, a clock somewhere in the house struck noon. &quot;I have your corset.&quot; she said to Larfen. The sandwich, surprisingly, didn&#39;t reply. &quot;It took a while.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace set the corset down on the table and started checking it over. About a minute later, she looked at Larfen and asked &quot;You ready?&quot;.<br><br>Larfen didn&#39;t say anything.<br><br>Just then, a much more human Larfen emerged from the other entrance to the kitchen.<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot; he said. &quot;You managed to make the corset.&quot;<br><br>Scape looked around. &quot;Right, the consciousness-transferring spell only lasts 24 hours. And we can&#39;t do it again until the next full moon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh well.&quot; Larfen said. &quot;The pile of really lewd stuff is off, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe...&quot; Scapegrace said. &quot;We could still figure something out. I&#39;ve got a whole closet full of corsets from previous Shipfests, after all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh. Yeah. You did show that to me ... Mistress.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, let&#39;s go take a look and see if we can think of something.&quot; Scapegrace said. &quot;After all, what&#39;s a good shipfic without a transparent sequel hook?&quot;<br><br>The pair of Boarders then went off to Scapegrace&#39;s closet to see if they could come up with any more crazy kinky shenanigans, since their original idea hadn&#39;t panned out all that well.<br><br>(( - Tomash, who&#39;s getting most of his shipping out early because he&#39;s traveling next week ))</p>
