            <p>I recognise all of the Tolkien images; the Mountain is iconic, though I&#39;ve always found the sketch of the dwarves to be highly ridiculous. ^_^<br><br>The Swedish one is... actually I don&#39;t know <i>what</i> that cover puts me in mind of, but I know I&#39;ve read a picture-book in exactly that style. Possibly it is the Moomins, but my immediate reaction was Noggin the Nog. Either way, pike-and-shield Bilbo in his nightcap is hilarious. As is Angry Dwarf Concert.<br><br>(WTF Gollum count: 1)<br><br>The Japanese ones I think show signs of being influenced by the Western artwork - that design of Bag-End is pure <a href="http://arenaillustration.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bag-End-582x453.jpg">John Howe</a>, for instance.<br><br>(WTF Gollum count: 2)<br><br>Russia, again, reminds me of <i>something</i>, but I don&#39;t know what. Possibly the images I&#39;ve seen from the very first, 12-minute <i>Hobbit</i> film, which was animated in Russia. The shot of the sad dwarves looks like the faculty of Unseen University.<br><br>(WTF Gollum count:3)<br><br>The Czech one is... er... um... what was the scene were all the dwarves got naked in a river, again? o.O Must&#39;ve missed that one. I love the little image of Thorin&#39;s tomb, though: &quot;coffin, jewel in coffin, sword on top, job done!&quot;.<br><br>(No Gollum, just some rather violent head-stabbing.)<br><br>And the Sendak... can you imagine a Sendak <i>Where the Wild Goblins Are</i>-style Hobbit? I never knew I wanted this. :(<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But I don&#39;t think it <i>is</i> the Moomins, is what I was trying unsuccessfully to say. That cover is absolutely ringing a very strong bell, but I don&#39;t know what it is.<br><br>I want to say Vikings, but that brings me back to Noggin the Nog, and the art style is actually quite different. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Wind">cover for Rosemary Sutcliff&#39;s &#39;Dawn Wind&#39;</a> is faintly similar, but again, I can&#39;t see why I&#39;d go &#39;that shield! Those mountains! That dragon!&#39; at it.<br><br>The inside illustrations don&#39;t have the same effect at <i>all</i>; it&#39;s very specifically the cover. (Though I am quite baffled by the one of Bilbo summoning the storm... did I miss that along with the naked dwarves??)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The dwarves bathed at the ford from the Carrock (where the eagles left them) to the eastern bank of the Anduin (from where they proceeded to meet Beorn the were-bear).<br><br>But &quot;Bilbo summoning a storm&quot;?

            <p>My favourite of these might be the Jansson ones but they&#39;re all real cool in their own ways. All the unique versions of Gollum are especially interesting and I like all of them (but especially the Jansson one who is real proper ominous). They should all team up. <br><br>I remember, a while back, finding a bunch of artwork on Tolkien&#39;s stuff by a guy called Tim Kirk - I plugged a bit of it on the Discord.

            <p>... the Test Tube of Galadriel, though. XD<br><br>I like the one of Bilbo walking in the forest - Tolkien would approve - and also the shot of Smaug the Golden over Lake-Town. There&#39;s an excellent sense of menace there.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Part of this got linked in chat, and I thought it was worth pointing out to everyone.<br><br>So, a fellow named Austin McConnell made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq-9BnHPjsY">a video complaining about the storytelling issues he found in <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i></a> (spoilers for Cursed Child).<br><br>Then, he made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSQJ9W4SxiQ">followup video explaining how he&#39;d rewrite the story while sticking to the existing costuming, sets, etc.</a>. Said video has spoilers for the original play, and probably also spoils <i>Nineteen Years Later</i>, an actual, you can buy tickets to it stage play based on the rewrite. How this came to be is documented in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsH8zEhEkk&amp;feature=youtu.be">this video, which also has interviews with the writer and actors, as well as giving you a sense of what a performance was like</a>.<br><br>Anyhow, I thought this was interesting and didn&#39;t want to start a new thread.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>An, uncertain, shadowy fight, with countless lives hanging the balance. In a world of grey morals, an idealist faces against both reality and hardened cynicism from those that surround him, joining his heroic ally in a battle that may well decise the fate of the world while the story asks us to ponder what it really <i>means</i> to be a hero.<br><br>I am, of course, talking about DC Comics&#39; classic series, <i>Watchmen</i>.<br><br>...What&#39;s that you say, that summary also neatly describes <i>Fate Stay/Night: Unlimited Blade Works</i>, a third of the well-known visual novel (adapted into an excellent anime by ufotable) which I recently finished reading and is also in the title of this post? Well shpx. Guess I better talk about that, too.<br><br>Yes, it&#39;s a double header. These series have some similarities, and I want to talk about it. Starting with Unlimited Blade Works, the brighter and happier of the two series. Which tells you a lot about Watchmen.<br><br>Unlimited Blade Works is one of the approximate one million and five installations in the popular Fate franchise and also one path through the visual novel that started it all. They&#39;re both the same story, don&#39;t worry.<br><br>For those of you unfamiliar with Fate, it&#39;s about 7-way Battle Royale between mages for the Holy Grail, a magical item that can grant one wish. Each mage is assisted by one &quot;servant,&quot; a legendary hero from the past. Except it&#39;s actually way more complicated than that, but eh, close enough.<br><br>We follow Shirou Emiya, a shiny-eyed idealist who one day dreams of becoming a hero as he accidentally winds up a member of the fight with a servant of his own. He has basic combat skills, so little magical talent that I legally can&#39;t call him a mage, and his only major ability for the majority of the story is a stubborn refusal to die, no matter how much he really should have. Did I mention he&#39;s also registering 0.9 Chagnys on the Hero Stupidity Scale?<br><br>So yeah. Aside from the unique, interesting world and decently developed characters, one of Fate&#39;s main tricks is throwing a shiny-eyed Shonen protagonist into a shadowy world of grey morality and beating the crap out of him. Shirou has a childlike perspective on heroism, and his dream is to save everyone, no matter how impossible that might be. He also has a cripplingly low self-worth as a result of childhood trauma and is thus entirely willing to throw aside his life to save another. The arc of Unlimited Blade Works is all about throwing those childish ideals into question, and forcing Shirou to really examine himself, and ask if his ideals are really the right ones.<br><br>...Which brings us to Watchmen.<br><br>Watchmen&#39;s Shirou analogue in terms of idealism is a half-mad (if not full-mad) hyper-reactionary who goes by the name of Rorschach. He thinks of sex as inherently filthy and amoral and has absolutely no qualms about killing people to deliver justice. He also serves double-duty as a mockery of Steve Ditko&#39;s philosophically objectivist heroes, and while some of his suspicions are right and he serves as a viewpoint character for much of the comic, he&#39;s never shown as something to aspire to.<br><br>Dang. Well that&#39;s a different tone.<br><br>As a sidenote, it&#39;s worth noting that despite being a very negative portrayal of the far right, Rorschach is Ted Cruz&#39;s favorite superhero. Because art is dead, the world is a bleak comedy, and Ted Cruz is somehow always the punchline.<br><br>But I digress. The point of this is that Watchmen goes to some dark places. Like, off the bat. The first superhero in this world is a gay BDSM klansman or something. Sadly, that&#39;s not a joke. Although it feels a lot more tastful and less for the shock value in the actual comic.<br><br>I mean, if I had to guess how this cast came to be, I&#39;d say that Alan Moore asked himself what kind of people would dress themselves up in brightly colored spandex and beat up and/or shoot up criminals, and the answer he came up with was &quot;really twisted ones.&quot; So it seems like almost every single character in Watchmen is at least somewhat disturbed. At least a little.<br><br>But if nothing else, Watchmen definitely had a lot to say. And... dangit, I can&#39;t TALK about how it questions the concepts of superheroes or looks at the same sort of idealism Fate does, or how much just interesting stuff there is because I don&#39;t want to spoil it.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to spoil either of these. They&#39;re definitely worth reading. Or in the case of Blade Works, watching. Don&#39;t watch Watchmen, though. It&#39;s not as good.</p>

            <p><i>As hS and Nesh remember, I used to make a lot of PPC memes using Walfas. Then I stopped because (among other things) Walfas&#39;s create.swf no longer opens in a new tab on my computer, and instead my laptop downloads the file, which I don&#39;t know if I want. Since I can&#39;t do that, I decided to do something PPC and memey another way, by trying to figure out what memes and/or specific iterations of a meme best represent some Boarders I know. I&#39;ve only got two, myself included, because I don&#39;t have that many ideas, but that&#39;s what replying with your own is for! Enjoy!<br><br>P.S.

            <p>You&#39;ve already formed Sulfur Hexafluoride, which is apparently a potent greenhouse gas which reacts violently with lithium. So if you were SMgF, you could probably get that kind of explosion from the magnesium.<br><br>There are three different manganese (Mn) fluorides, and a few for Molybdenum (Mo), but none of them strike any particularly interesting chords.

And if they <i>don&#39;t</i> react, you&#39;ve got the stink of sulfur, the white flames of magnesium, and the eats-your-bones of fluorine. What&#39;s not to like???<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... I guess you must be a mixture. And that means I can refer to the world&#39;s foremost authority on chemistry, nay, on science as a whole:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RODq8y0.jpg"><br><br><i>What If?</i> is an excellent book which I highly recommend. Down on page 35, xkcd&#39;s Randall sets out to answer the question:<br><br><i>What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?</i><br><br>Working through your name, in order of atomic number, these are his comments:<br><br><i>-The cube of hydrogen would rise upward and disperse, like a balloon without a balloon.<br><br>-The... nitrogen drift[s] around, slowly dispersing.<br><br>-[No specific comment on Molybdenum. It&#39;s pretty stable stuff.]<br><br>-[Actually no comment on Holmium, either. It apparently changes colour depending on lighting conditions, from yellow to red.]</i><br><br>So far, so good, but Es is a 7th-row element:<br><br><i>-[On the sixth row] you would die from what we might call &quot;extremely acute radiation poisoning&quot; - that is, you would be cooked.<br><br>The seventh row would be much worse.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Unfortunately for our project, the transuranic elements don&#39;t vanish quietly. They decay radioactively. And most of them decay into things that <b>also</b> decay. A cube of any of the highest-numbered elements would decay within seconds, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.<br><br>The result wouldn&#39;t be like a nuclear explosion - it <b>would</b> be a nuclear explosion.</i><br><br>...<br><br>At this point, I was going to reveal that you actually have an ace up your sleeve that might save you. Holmium, you see, is an aggressive neutron scavenger - it&#39;s actually used to poison nuclear reactors, to stop the chain reaction from running. So I was thinking it would dampen the explosion for you.<br><br>Except... Einsteinium decay isn&#39;t a chain reaction. It&#39;s just an everything-explodes-at-once reaction. So while the Ho would probably cut down on some of the elemental shrapnel, the Es is still gonna just go boom. :)<br><br>(Now, if <i>I</i> had the Ho, it would really help with my Uranium and Radon. Actually, Indium can fulfil the same purpose... but I&#39;ve got the same Es as you, so I&#39;m going to go boom anyway.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My favorite Modern deck is <a href="https://badmoonmtg.wordpress.com/2017/09/15/rack-in-black">8Rack</a>.  It makes my opponent discard their whole hand.  Then it punishes them for not having any cards in their hand.  I don&#39;t want them to play Magic or have fun.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Agent Bios<br><br><br>Name: Colonel Caleb Bradbury<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 56<br><br>Sex: Male<br><br>Home Continuum: An unpublished fanfic based on Daniel Pinkwater&#39;s &quot;Borgle&quot;.<br><br>Personality: Bradbury is what is known as a “character”. He has a strange ability to procure just about anything just about anywhere, and a related ability to establish himself as an authority figure even in situations totally unfamiliar to him.<br><br>Appearance: The colonel is a gaunt man, just shy of two meters tall. His head is very round, a feature accentuated by his rather severe buzz-cut. He has a short beard, skin on the brown side, and a generally weathered look. He is a good bit more athletic than one would expect from a man his age, thanks to the medical and cybernetic science of the 2050s.<br><br>History: In his many years he has been not just an officer in the Argentine army, but also a grave digger, stamp forger, purveyor of shoddy knockoff products, piano tuner, ticket scalper, blackjack dealer, and many other things. He spent an elliptical number of years (time is elliptical in his home continuum) traveling through space, time, and the other by means of a television-detector van equipped with a Hydramatic drive, partly in search of adventure, partly to escape the repercussions of some ill-thought-out business ventures.<br><br><br>Name: Rasputin Gibbs<br><br>Species: Draconian<br><br>Age: 24<br><br>Sex: Male<br><br>Home Continuum: World 1.963, the world that exists in certain conspiracy theories.<br><br>Personality: On some deep level, Gibbs wants to be in a Sergio Leone movie. He doesn’t speak much, he wears a stetson, and he seems terminally calm. His interest in cookery according to the Galenic theory is just a bonus. He uses Draconian expressions in his speech, such as the greeting “Bast Chauble” and the philosophical concept of going “even more unto Yark.”<br><br>Appearance: Gibbs is a seven foot tall reptilian humanoid with a hunched posture, dark green scales, and a nice set of fangs. He is rarely seen without his stetson, and his eyes hold a look of steely determination that took him years to perfect.<br><br>History: Gibbs spent many years working as a security guard in Dulce base, a joint human-draconian military base located under Archuleta Mesa. He held himself to a very high standard, and soon became known as one of the most capable officers on the security team. With this good mixture of skill and expendability, Gibbs was an ideal candidate to send on a test jaunt through the base’s new portal. He came unstuck in space and time, and learned of Sues, or, as he called them, reality-warping entities. When we meet him, he has several unlicensed Sue killings under his belt, and has consequently attracted the attention of the PPC.</p>

            <p>This is based on the control prompt &quot;we see both agents recruited.&quot;<br><br>Colonel Caleb Bradbury, veteran of thirty years and uncounted battles, was having a very confusing day. He guessed that he had taken a wrong turn on the interstate, because now he was in some sort of idyllic countryside, and his preliminary scouting efforts had revealed a village home to some interestingly-dressed pygmies. Given that some of the houses appeared to be mostly underground, he did not entirely discard the notion that he had landed in Matamata, New Zealand, while the Fellowship Of the Ring was being filmed. Space-Time-and-The-Other tourism had taken him to stranger places, though the credibility of that particular place as the destination of this particular detour was somewhat lowered by the extreme realism of the area and the apparent lack of a camera crew. His only way to know would be to check if the buildings had interiors, and he wasn’t willing to risk detection.<br><br>Of course, Bradbury had not risen through the ranks of the Argentine army by losing his head in unfamiliar situations. So, while he was confused, he didn’t show it. Instead, he occupied himself with concealing his vehicle. A television detector van, let alone one fitted with a Hydramatic drive, would cause some awkward questions in what could be a medieval society. His attempt to hide it proved futile, however, as he had only the entrenching tool he had brought with him, and he was trying to hide a van. Instead, he unpacked his gear and made camp for the night. This consisted of hiding inside his overturned van and eating a protein bar. As both a soldier and a time tourist, he had gained the ability to sleep just about anywhere, so he quickly drifted off.<br><br>The next morning the Colonel awoke to someone knocking on the door above him. He looked up to see one of the locals, and he unlocked the door. The humanoid quickly opened the door and climbed from the door frame into the van, using the seats as handholds. Bradbury thought briefly, unsure how to speak to the locals, then said: “Hail and hello, kind sirrah. I bideth thee good tidings. Prithee, what bringest thou to mine cave of steel?” The creature pulled a notebook from one of his pockets, and began to write. Bradbury could hear him mutter:<br>“Encountered extra-canonical humanoid… Seems to have caught sunstroke… In possession of high-value asset… Hydramatic drive... currently damaged.”<br><br>“I assure you,” said Colonel Bradbury, “I am in full possession of all my faculties, except the faculty of the department of engineering, who could probably help me. But I digress. Perhaps you, in the absence of the faculty, could furnish aid?”<br>The man put away his notebook and looked at Bradbury as if he had just noticed him.<br>“Yes… I think we can come to some sort of deal. How about I take this wreck off your hands and get you out of here?”<br>“I accept this, but before we go, I have some questions. First: Where am I? Second: Why are you here? Third: How do we leave? And finally: Who are you?” asked Bradbury, never one to go into situations blindly.<br>“Hobbiton; that’s classified; through a portal; and Allen I. Nirvana, department of Intelligence, PPC.”<br>Bradbury considered this for a moment, then spoke: “Excellent. Let’s get out of here.”<br>Nirvana started to remove an object from his waistband, paused, and asked Bradbury a very significant question:<br>“Tell me, are you interested in a job?”<br><br>Rasputin Gibbs lay in wait. Flashgun at the ready, he scanned the horizon for the shape of his target. Ever since the accident, this had been his life: the glitter-monsters were an affront to reality, so he killed them. It was simple, so it brought him comfort, and a creature in his situation needed a routine. As the thing came into view, he readied his weapon and prepared to make the kill. Then a teenager walked up to the thing that should not exist, and began to talk to it, getting in the way of his shot. <br><br>Gibbs held back. He didn’t kill people. As he waited, the kid finished talking, the monster said something, and then the kid unsheathed a knife and stabbed it about six times, at which point it crumpled to the ground, bleeding sparkles. Gibbs went to compliment him on his work, but as Gibbs approached, the kid turned and spoke to him: “Rasputin Gibbs, you have been charged with making a nuisance and vigilante Sue killing. You are sentenced to conscription into the PPC. Look this way, please.”<br>Gibbs started to speak:<br>“Wait, wh-”</p>

            <p>This is based on the control prompt &quot;One agent tries to convince another to help with some kind of business venture.&quot;<br><br>As bases of operations went, Response Center 9-unreadable-smudge wasn’t among the best. To be fair, it had floor space, but most of it was occupied. This occupying force was led by a vanguard of random trash, with specialist support provided by the remains of shelves, and an armored division of broken machinery interspersed the ranks, as if to cow would-be cleaners into submission. On the edge of this cave of non-wonders was a small circle where the debris had been cleared, occupied by reptilian gunslinger Rasputin Gibbs and his human associate, Colonel Caleb Bradbury. After a long silence, the Colonel spoke:<br><br>“So.”<br><br>“So?” Replied the lizard-man.<br><br>“Yeah.”<br><br>“Yeah?”<br><br>For a few moments, both considered the conversation, then Bradbury took the initiative: “Shall we keep talking in circles like co-dependent parrots, or shall we occupy our time with something more likely to bear fruit?”<br><br>“Bear fruit? Isn’t that the one that mauls people?” asked Gibbs.<br><br>“Yes, but you can drive it off by throwing zucchinis at it,” replied Bradbury.<br><br>“Zucchinis?”<br><br>“Yes, I once heard a story about a Russian woman who, when menaced by a bear that had broken into her home, chased it out by throwing several zucchinis at it,” said Bradbury, as if what he had just said made some sort of sense.<br><br>“Anyway, what is this dumb scheme that you have in mind?”<br><br>“Alcohol. It’s the best bartering commodity we can feasibly get, and our key into this place’s informal power structure. By making it right here in HQ we can undercut the prices of any competitor. Also, liquor taxes are for chumps.” As Bradbury spoke, he waved his hands in the air like some kind of TV alien hunter.<br><br>“Hmm… Have you done this before, or are we going to blind our coworkers?” asked the skeptical lizard-man.<br><br>“It’s fine. I learned how to do this years ago. We just need water, sugar, and yeast. I once did this with bread mold and ketchup.”<br><br>“That must be sheer murder on the humors,” said Gibbs, obviously disgusted.<br><br>“Don’t worry, I’m never doing that again.”<br><br>“So how do we make this happen?”<br><br>“I think there’s a general store somewhere in HQ. You can probably get stuff there,” said the human. “You head over there, I’ll try to find this alleged ‘console’ thing.”<br><br>“It’s your funeral.”<br><br>The lizard-man left, and several hours passed. When he returned, he could see that the Colonel’s attempts at his Sisyphean task had been in vain.<br><br>“I’m back!” shouted Gibbs as he opened the door, burlap sack in hand.<br><br>“Any luck?” asked Bradbury as he attempted to move an overturned oil drum whose presence in the RC must have made sense to someone at some point.<br><br>“Yeah, they had a good deal on baking stuff.” As he spoke, he placed an object on the floor next to the man: “Also, I got a bottle of whiskey, ‘cause it seems like this is gonna take a while.”</p>

            <p>Okay, so here&#39;s my thoughts:<br><br>-I recognise you, you&#39;ve participated here, all good on that front.<br><br>-Your spelling is generally okay, though your punctuation is a bit erratic: &#39;“So?” Replied the lizard-man.&#39; should take a lowercase R. Also: Daniel Pinkwater&#39;s book is entitled <i>Borgel</i>, not Borgle. Creating a mini for a new canon in your Permission post is a bit of a red flag.<br><br>-I&#39;m... iffy on your understanding of the PPC canon. Prompt 2 pretty much ignores the PPC, except in that it has a General Store and consoles (which should be pretty easy to spot, actually). As an example: the mention of &#39;liquor taxes&#39; doesn&#39;t really fit with PPC HQ, and the whole concept of nasty homebrewed alcohol goes out of the window when Rudi&#39;s sells every drink in the multiverse... but if we just assume Bradbury doesn&#39;t know that, it still sort of works.<br><br>Prompt 1 also mostly ignores the PPC, but where it does touch it, I&#39;m still iffy. Bradbury&#39;s recruitment <i>kind of</i> works, though I&#39;m not at all convinced by Nirvana&#39;s switch from &#39;that&#39;s classified&#39; to &#39;want a job?&#39; (and I don&#39;t know why you think PPC Intelligence is interested in acquiring a single broken dimension-hopping van). Gibbs, on the other hand, is <i>conscripted</i> to the PPC, which doesn&#39;t sit terribly well with me.<br><br>Okay, moving on:<br><br>-Your characters. They have rather opposing problems.<br><br>--Bradbury is actually quite good, as a 19th Century British explorer. Except... you claim he&#39;s Argentine, despite his name and attitude. It&#39;s like you smashed two characters together: one a Victorian colonel who would talk unironically about &#39;pygmies&#39;, and one a time-traveller who has spent enough time in the 2050s to be cybernetically enhanced. Those two halves simply don&#39;t fit for me.<br><br>--Gibbs... well, take a look at Prompt 2: Delete the words &#39;reptilian&#39; and &#39;lizard&#39;, and you can&#39;t tell that he&#39;s anything other than human. You&#39;ve set up a rather interesting backstory for him, but you&#39;ve not made the slightest use of it. He&#39;s a seven feet tall highly-trained gunslinger who is (I assume) part of a cabal that secretly controls the world! So why write him as if you could replace him with Agent Joe Bloggs?<br><br>(Also on a character note: you inserted two random, single-use PPC agents, and made both of them male. The only instance of a female pronoun in either of your prompts is the story about the Russian woman. Given that PPC HQ is probably still majority female, that&#39;s a habit you should break yourself of.)<br><br>-Moving onto the stories... Prompt 1 is really disjointed. What you&#39;ve written is one story, and then a couple of lines on the end to meet the prompt. I don&#39;t like that approach; a story should be a unified whole. I&#39;ve already mentioned the problems I have with the representation of the PPC, so I won&#39;t belabour that point.<br><br>Prompt 2 does hang together as a single story, though there&#39;s nothing to really embed it in the PPC, as I said before. And... I feel like in both stories, you missed multiple chances to write <i>humour</i>. A striking example is the bottle of whiskey at the end of 2: was that meant to be a punchline? If so, it needs more development, because it falls utterly flat. If not... why not? Because it absolutely should be.<br><br>You have some lines that ought to be funny (&#39;co-dependent parrots&#39;), but there&#39;s just nothing to carry the joke. Take a look at this exchange:<br><br><i>“Bear fruit? Isn’t that the one that mauls people?” asked Gibbs.<br><br>“Yes, but you can drive it off by throwing zucchinis at it,” replied Bradbury.</i><br><br>What are we reading here? Is Gibbs an unintentional straight-man who actually does think &#39;Bear fruit&#39; is a thing, with Bradbury winding him up? Was he trying to make a joke to get to know Bradbury? Are they both joking and laughing together, mugging like loons?<br><br>We don&#39;t know. &#39;Asked&#39;. &#39;Replied&#39;. That&#39;s all we get.<br><br>As an example, assuming the first scenario is correct, here&#39;s a rough alternate take on those two lines:<br><br><i>&quot;Bear... fruit?&quot; Gibbs rolled the words around his mouth as if tasting them. &quot;Does it maul people, perhaps?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Bradbury put on his most serious expression. &quot;But you can drive it off by throwing zucchinis at it.&quot;</i><br><br>Do you see the difference? This version gives the characters personality, rather than just assigning them lines. It provides something for the readers to latch onto, rather than just being a vehicle for getting to the end of the story.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Overall, it&#39;s not looking too good, but... I think you can do better. So here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to ask for:<br><br>Please write another short story, under 1000 words, responding to the following prompt:<br><br><b>While carrying their first batch of homebrew to the cafeteria, Bradbury and Gibbs encounter someone in the corridor.</b><br><br>I don&#39;t mind who they meet: feel free to create your own character, use a free-use NPC (which includes the Flowers), or (for the purposes of this non-canonical scene <b>only</b>) borrow any of my characters. My wording shouldn&#39;t be construed to indicate only one person can encounter them, either.<br><br>I will be looking to see if this piece addresses my concerns listed above, including but not limited to: showing your understanding of the PPC, writing your agents with their backstories in mind, and writing with at least some humour and engagement. Making sure your punctuation around dialogue is correct would also be good.<br><br>(And, probably not relatedly, but please decide whether Bradbury is Argentine or Victorian English, and adjust his description accordingly.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><br>Rasputin Gibbs would have felt a lot better about life if he had known where he was, but the featureless corridors of the PPC headquarters seemed intent on getting him lost. On the plus side, Colonel Bradbury had a seemingly endless supply of anecdotes, so what could have been total boredom had turned into a fairly educational delve into his partner’s psyche.<br><br>“So I had about half a minute to create an explanation for the non-existence of the Bureau of Military Acupuncture, and all I could get out of my mouth was ‘503.’ The Policía Militar thug paused in confusion, and this gave me enough time to turn my random utterance into something I could use. So I said I wanted a signed 503 and an initialed 22b or I would court martial the poor schmuck. Now, that was in no way within my power, but I figured that anyone who got sent to deal with stuff this dumb wouldn’t know that.”<br><br>At this point Gibbs interrupted him: “Wait, so you just made up a branch of Sanitary and Health Command?”<br><br>Bradbury didn’t answer, instead holding up a closed fist in the universal gesture for “stop.” He then turned and whispered to Gibbs: “There’s someone up ahead. I think we have a problem.”<br><br>“I see someone,” said Gibbs, “but not the problem.”<br><br>Gibbs looked again at the agent approaching them, just to check, but from his limited experience she seemed to be a standard PPC agent: a frazzled-looking human female with glasses.<br><br>Bradbury’s voice took on a more urgent tone, his mind buzzing with the application of inapplicable life experience. “We’re about to have authority abused at us.”<br><br>Gibbs was about to reply when the human coming towards them noticed the crate Bradbury held, and asked with mild interest: “Running errands?”<br><br>Bradbury knew how this would go. In his hind-brain this was 2022, he was a Subteniente being hassled by someone more seasoned, and it wouldn’t end well. The important thing was to confuse the issue.<br><br>This line of non-thought led to his next utterance: “Drain cleaner.”<br><br>The agent looked at him for a moment, one eyebrow raised: “Then why do they have hand-written labels saying: ‘Colonel Bradbury’s Old White Lightning’?”<br><br>Bradbury didn’t even blink. “I’m smuggling it. For the good of society. I’m thwarting the tyrannical excise-man and bringing cheap goods to those who need them.”<br><br>The agent’s mild curiosity had turned into severe confusion. “You do realize no government has jurisdiction in HQ, right? There’s no one who can tax goods.”<br><br>Bradbury took this curve-ball and, to mix a metaphor, ran with it. “Exactly. I can buy and sell anything here totally duty-free. Why do impede me in my quest? Do you hate the poor? Are you some kind of Communist? Are you some kind of Capitalist?! DO YOU WANT THE POOR TO HAVE MOLDY PLUMBING?!”<br><br>Gibbs wondered what it was like to be an awkward twenty-something confronted by an old guy shouting for no reason. It was all he could do not to explode into a pile of laughter, or whatever it was humans said.<br><br>Bradbury turned and whispered to Gibbs, total calm in his voice: “On my count, run. One. Two. Three. Now.”<br><br>Bradbury dropped the box and ran headlong down the corridor. Gibbs went with the flow, but managed to get out an incongruously cheerful “Bast Chauble!” before he left the bewildered young agent’s hearing range.<br><br>After they had gotten themselves even more thoroughly lost, Gibbs turned to Bradbury: “So, in the end, how did that whole Military Acupuncture thing play out?”<br><br>Bradbury thought about this.<br><br>“Upon reflection, it doesn&#39;t seem that important.”<br><br>(Words in Spanish were originally italicized.)</p>

            <p>Has it really only been one year since I introduced myself here? In that time, I came out, got permission, cowrote a mission with a distinguished PPCer, wrote a lot of stuff here, wrote even more on Discord, made a suprising number of people laugh at the shipfest, uttered the phrase &quot;hot crim-on-crim action,&quot; roleplayed a lot, read a ton of books, and made more friends than I could count.

You’ve been an amazing addition to the PPC and I’m very glad you decided to stick around. It’s nice having you here... and I think I might just have to add myself to your list of cowrites sometime. ;)<br><br>And... well, at risk of talking too much about myself, a lot of stuff has happened to me this year. Good stuff. Moving on stuff. Baby bro moves into his dorm for the first time tomorrow. I got top surgery and finally feel at home in my own body. <br><br>Most significantly to me, though... I move to London on the six year anniversary of my release from the first psych ward I stayed in. At risk of sounding incredibly corny, I went from having no hope to positively bursting with it. It’s kind of amazing how drastic a change it’s been in such short time.<br><br>Life’s been good.</p>

            <p>Hello! It is me, Jellyity. I introduced myself about a month ago. (Maybe longer?) I am not sure how to word this, but, I have an RP idea. It is called Sue Simulator. The goal of the game is, there is a machine producing Sues. Players will have to fight through hordes of Sues in order to make their way to the machine, so they can shut it off. Is this a good RP idea?<br>I would like some feedback. Thank you!</p>

            <p>First of all, I&#39;ve noticed that RPs here, excluding the Purim one, kinda happen spontaneously. If you look at the Wiki pages for the Blackout and similar things, you&#39;ll notice that they started from RPs and sorta just happened. To do this, you kinda need to have a good feel for how the Board works, what&#39;s the right time to post something new, etc. Since this is only your third post, I suggest you sit back and relax, and see what the Board has to offer already before you start something major of your own.<br><br>Second, how would Sue Simulator fit into the existing plot of the PPC? Again, one has to have a good idea of the PPC universe to pull RPs like this (that include the PPC universe and not just the Boarders) off. The idea of a machine making Sues really sounds like the already-existing idea of Mary Sue Factories, but it looks like you don&#39;t know that. So I suggest that while you sit back and relax, you also read up, at the very least on the Wiki, so that you may get a feel for what everything is here.<br><br>But do not despair! Eventually, whether it&#39;s an RP in later years, a new addition to the PPC video game family, or a campaign in my planned addition to said video games, you&#39;ll find a use for this idea. Don&#39;t worry, I know how you feel. I too was an enthusiastic newbie who tried to contribute before I knew enough to successfully contribute. You just gotta walk before you run. Okay, Jellyity? Okay. :)<br><br>TL;DR: One word. <i>Wait.</i><br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The threads thing is due to the fact that the Board&#39;s memory is limited. Remember the fairly recent post about how the archives have been updated? Well, those archives exist because every new post knocks am old one off the back, so to speak. The Board&#39;s memory generally goes back about...a year and a half or so, I think?<br><br>Which is not at all to say you shouldn&#39;t make new posts! Just try not to make a new one where a reply update to an existing thread on the front page could serve, and generally try not to make, say, three or four or five new posts in quick succession unless they&#39;re all very different and so on.<br><br>And, of course, it also just makes it easier to view and interact with topics if they&#39;re all or mostly in the same thread! It&#39;s much simpler to look at and answer a series of PPC universe questions that are in one thread than it is to answer them spread out over many!<br><br>Not that we&#39;re very, seriously, extremely annoyed if you make a couple multiple posts at first--I&#39;m pretty sure the majority of us have been there. We&#39;re mainly just explaining and asking that you learn for the future, since that&#39;s how the Board works! :)<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Ce’rana of Borune closed her eyes and settled into the hollow tree-trunk she was hiding in, taking pains to keep her breaths as quiet and shallow as possible. She didn’t expect her hiding spot to give her away; it was, after all, still a tree, even if it was technically dead. But there was no sense in giving her pursuer advantages he didn’t need.<br><br>Time dragged on; her only measures of how long she’d been waiting there were the running count of her heartbeats and how many times someone had come by her hiding spot, each one leaving her tense. Slowly, her blinks lengthened, and eventually stopped. Her breathing deepened, becoming slow and rhythmic. She fell asleep.<br><br>It took a while, but someone walking by her hideout stopped. Alex poked his head into the hole, trying to spot her. It wasn’t hard to make out the only soft thing in a hard area, so he stood back. He grinned, took in a deep breath, and shouted “Boo!” at the top of his lungs.<br><br>Ce’rana jolted awake and screamed, automatically jerking to her feet. After a moment, she realized just who she was staring at, and scowled at him as she tried to calm her racing heart. “Was that entirely necessary?” she grumbled.<br><br>“It is when you fell asleep.” Alex stepped back from the tree, grinning as he turned away from her. “It isn’t like you wouldn’t have done the same thing if our roles were reversed.”<br><br>The Dryad clambered out of the hole with a huff, glaring at the back of his skull. “No, I would not have,” she muttered. “Of course, I make no promises about not startling you in general, but that would <i>not</i> have been my method.”<br><br>“Well, you were sleeping like a baby. How else was I supposed to wake you up? I couldn’t rock the tree.” He started walking, not really aiming for anywhere in particular.<br><br>She shook her head at that. “I was doing no such thing. And there was always the option of knocking - the tree would have woken me on his own.”<br><br>Alex shrugged. “Considering what we were playing, I don’t think it would have let me win until I broke out the matches.” He didn’t even need to look to guess what kind of effect that had on her.<br><br>She froze in utter horror. “That,” she choked out, “is <i>not</i> funny, Alex. Not in the least.”<br><br>“I didn’t say I was gonna use them.” He patted his pockets. “Actually, I don’t think I even have any on me.” <br><br>Ce’rana closed her eyes and sighed, shaking her head as she moved to catch up with her partner. “It was still an awful joke to have made,” she muttered unhappily.<br><br>“Who said I was joking? Pulling out matches tends to make your tree listen to me. Or, as much as a tree can, at least.” <br><br>She froze again, this time only for a moment before she pulled out a pen, gripping it far more tightly than she perhaps ought to have. “You do <i>what</i> to make him listen.”<br><br>Alex froze and turned to look at her. When he saw the pen, he swore quietly and took off running down the halls. He wasn’t letting that pen anywhere near him. Not like that.<br><br>The Dryad bolted after him, shouting mental curses in Imperial Tolnedran all the way. She didn’t wave her weapon threateningly; she didn’t vocalize her swears; she just focused on not letting her long-legged partner get too far ahead of her.<br><br>Still, despite her efforts, she lost him three turns in. Muttering some of her curses to herself, she kicked the Generic Wall and began tromping back towards the Department of Technical Errors, Grammar Division. She could always catch him when he came back to sleep.</p>

            <p>As far as birthdays went, Victoria Brown&#39;s nineteenth was shaping up to be pretty rotten.<br><br>She&#39;d graduated Hogwarts the June before, a witch ready to make her mark on the world. June had become July, and the Ministry responded to her application with a form rejection, her name misspelled on the first and only page. July had become August, and Obscurus Books, a safe bet for a Ravenclaw, even a muggle-born one, hadn&#39;t returned her owls. Now it was late September, and Brown had sent resumes to the Junk Shop in Diagon and the local Tesco.<br><br>Staying in touch with friends was proving harder than she&#39;d expected, too. Portsmouth was a long ways from everywhere, in both the muggle and magical worlds, and there was only so much a cellphone and an owl could do to keep up with friends who were happily finding jobs, love, and other things.<br><br>On the other hand, Brown was finding books. At least there were libraries here, and authors writing about history or space or magic, close to the truth but wrong in enough ways that she could tell they didn&#39;t have a clue it was real. She could walk to the nearest library almost by habit, just a muggle with a wand in her bag and, occasionally, when nobody was looking, an owl on her shoulder.<br><br>Habit was useful, this morning- the September fog had been getting thicker over the last few weeks, until it was dense enough that it shrouded the city around the clock. Everything was muffled, the preternatural hush of a world waiting for the weather to change.<br><br>Brown&#39;s feet had carried her down to the university. Today felt like a non-fiction day, and the library there was tempting for all that it was by the water, and thus even deeper in the gloom of the fog.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t until her hand hit glass that she realized that something was wrong. Habit was habit, she&#39;d walked to her favorite coffee shop first- except it wasn&#39;t there. The building didn&#39;t even have a storefront, for all that it was on the little high street that ran alongside the university. It was just empty, anonymous windows in a forgettable brick facade.<br><br>Wrong turns happened. Brown stepped back, looked around, confirmed her bearings. This certainly seemed to be the place- Guildhall Walk, across from the-<br><br>The New Theater Royal was missing. Mostly. There was a facade in its place, sure, white porch in front of brickwork, but it looked flat and empty, like it was painted on an unimportant corner of one of the backdrops inside.<br><br>Brown glanced both ways before digging out her wand. This smelled like magic, for all that she&#39;d never heard of it. Some strange form of concealment charm, perhaps?<br><br>Thoughts of counterspells vanished from her mind when a thing that had once been a car drifted past. It moved aimlessly, as though it moved out of habit rather than any motive force- and instead of windows, there was just a broad black stripe wrapping around the vaguely-bloated shape.<br><br>Brown didn&#39;t run. Running was a bad idea. Brown walked quickly back the way she&#39;d come, wand in hand but forgotten.<br><br>It was all wrong, the details washing out of the world. There had been an old half-timbered building on the corner, now it was just a boxy building, white concrete and blank windows. There had been a little restaurant, catering to students with bright text on signs, now it was just a blank wall with &quot;pizza&quot; painted on it. Even that was fading, flaking, vanishing entirely.<br><br>Brown made it to the imposingly-named Winston Churchill Avenue, just to find it deserted. There were no people, there were no cars, real or car-things or anything, just fog and the looming sense of buildings. She walked around the railings, looked both ways before crossing the street.<br><br>There was a building on the far side, she was pretty sure- but it didn&#39;t loom out of the fog. The sidewalk just ended, an edge opening into mist. Brown turned to go back, but there was nothing there, either- the curb-stone was the edge of the abyss on that side, leaving her on an island of sidewalk, floating in foggy nothingness.<br><br>A shrinking island of sidewalk. Every time Brown turned it had lost size where she wasn&#39;t looking, squares of concrete vanishing into nothingness. It was ten meters across, and then five, and then she blinked and it was down to a three-by-three grid of pavers, barely a meter to a side.<br><br>There were ways out of this. Brown tried to picture home, somewhere safe to apparate to. She couldn&#39;t do it- nor could she visualize the library, or the coffee shop, or the shore, or anywhere that was close enough that she felt she had a chance of getting there safely. London and Hogwarts were clearer but further, and the rising wave of panic made it clear that long-distance apparation was out of the question.<br><br>Her phone was similarly useless- low battery, no signal, no messages.<br><br>It felt like it was getting darker, or maybe her mind was playing tricks on her with nothing but fog to look at. That, at least, was fixable. Brown raised her wand, said &quot;<i>lumos!</i>&quot;, winced at the sudden, clear glare of the charm.<br><br>And then there wasn&#39;t anything else to do. Brown sat, a witch in jeans and a sweater and a blue-and-bronze scarf loosely around her neck, and waited for the end of the world.<br><br>And waited for the end of the world.<br><br>And waited.<br><br>Who knew that ceasing to exist was so boring?<br><br>The next thing Brown heard, a moment, an eternity later, almost sounded like an air-raid siren. It was accompanied by something fading into existence, for once- a blue box, a police box, butted up against her square of sidewalk like a ship against a quay.<br><br>Brown tried to stand, to face the TARDIS with some semblance of dignity, just to find that one of her legs was asleep.<br><br>&quot;Sorry to bother you, doc-&quot; she started, as the door opened.<br><br>The person inside the TARDIS wasn&#39;t any Doctor that Brown knew. She looked like she could have been a student at the university, young and dark-haired and equal parts short and strong, as she demonstrated by casually hooking one of Brown&#39;s arms over her shoulder and pulling her to her feet.<br><br>&quot;Not me, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; she said, walking Brown into the TARDIS. &quot;Call me Grace. Let&#39;s get you out of here, hm?&quot;</p>

            <p>Sorry if this is a bit too short!<br><br><br><br>Tiger didn’t have a very good track record when it came to birthdays. Last year, for instance, he’d only got two presents, and the year before that he’d just lost the competition to Holly.<br><br>He’d hoped this one might be a little better, but it seemed to be worse. At least this year he had got presents, even if there weren’t that many and one of them (Holly’s, of course) had literally blown up in his face.<br><br>The problem was that what was meant to be a party had soon turned into just another evening of darts. Tiger’s father had given him some money, but he had promptly lost it all by losing a round to Andy. <br><br>He’d decided to escape before he was bankrupted, and had slipped out unnoticed during a particularly dramatic match between Holly and Timothy. Cautiously, he opened the door to the throne room a crack.<br><br>There was no-one there, as he had expected, except a huge white tiger who lifted her head as he came in and shut the door softly behind him.<br><br>“It’s alright, Minty,” he said quietly. “Only me.”<br><br>He walked slowly over to the tiger, who now appeared to be asleep, and sat down on the red rug beside her.<br><br>“Just you and me,” he said sadly. “Just you and me.”<br></p>

            <p>((Not an escape in the traditional sense, but I&#39;d say this one counts.))<br><br><br><br>8386071 stood still, stripped to the waist with his arms bound in front of him as the Mandalorian circled him slowly.<br><br>“How old?”<br><br>“Twenty-two years and four months,” Ressh replied. “Son of a human whore and who knows what; a mongrel, most likely.”<br><br>“That doesn’t concern me.” The Mandalorian, Jaleth Ellea, tapped 8386071’s arm with a gauntleted hand, producing a faint clinking noise. “How old’s this thing?”<br><br>“Six years, same as the eye.”<br><br>“That’ll need replacing,” Jaleth muttered. “He got a name?”<br><br>Ressh grunted and shook his head.<br><br>“You’ll need a name,” Jaleth said, and 8386071 felt a small thrill of hope. Could it really be happening? He was leaving the palace? But what if his new master was crueler than the current one? Though nothing could be as bad as the breeding, could it? Or was he tempting fate with such thinking?<br><br>Jaleth turned to Ressh. “I’ll take him.”<br><br>“Three thousand credits,” Ressh said, and 8386071’s eyes widened, certain the Mandalorian would be dissuaded by the price—but Jaleth simply handed over his credit chip without a word.<br><br>The next hour was a whirlwind of activity. His chest was cut open and the detonator removed, and then he was hurried away to Jaleth’s ship. He’d never been to the nicer parts of the palace before, let alone the Master’s private shuttle landing, and he looked around with wide eyes at the gleaming floors and carved walls—and then he was bundled onto the ship without so much as a chance to say goodbye to Jeyla.<br><br>Jaleth piloted the shuttle into orbit, and 8386071 risked lifting his eyes off the floor to peek out the window. Tatooine was… somehow small, seeing it from this high up. He’d been told the planets were round, but until that moment, he wasn’t entirely sure if he’d believed it.<br><br>The cuffs that bound his wrists suddenly opened and fell to the floor with a <i>clank</i>, and Jaleth returned the remote opener to his pocket.<br><br>“So.” Jaleth spoke and 8386071 jumped, his gaze returning to his feet. “You’re a good fighter. I’m impressed.”<br><br>“Thank you, sir,” 8386071 finally said when it became clear the Mandalorian was waiting for him to speak.<br><br>Jaleth waved a dismissive hand. “None of that ‘sir’ business, d’you hear? You’re free now.”<br><br>8386071’s breath hitched. “F-free?” he stuttered.<br><br>“Free,” Jaleth repeated. “So how about you look me in the eye as an equal?”<br><br>Slowly, 8386071 did so, surprised to see Jaleth’s mouth turned up in a smile.<br><br>“That’s more like it, son,” Jaleth said, and 8386071 hesitantly smiled back. “Tell me, you were born on Tatooine, right? Ever left it before?”<br><br>“Yes sir, to both questions,” 8386071 said. “I’ve been taken offworld before to participate in prize fights on Nar Shaddaa.”<br><br>“Jaleth,” he corrected 8386071, who ducked his head in consternation. “You’re free now. Don’t call me sir again.”<br><br>“Yes si—yes… Jaleth.”<br><br>Jaleth nodded, steepling his fingers together. “You could do things out there that I’d never seen a human being do without the use of the Force,” he said. “You ever been tested before?”<br><br>8386071 shook his head.<br><br>“Huh.” Jaleth scratched his chin, then shrugged. “So, way I see it, you’ve got a couple of options now. I drop you off at a spaceport of your choosing with a bit of money and some proper clothes, and send you on to live your life as you see fit… or, you can stay with me, if you want, and I’ll teach you everything I know.”<br><br>“Everything?”<br><br>“Everything. But first—you’re gonna need a name. Got any ideas?”<br><br>8386071 shook his head again. Jaleth shrugged and pulled out a datapad, scrolling through it until he tossed it at 8386071. <br><br>“There you go.”<br><br>8386071 looked down at what he could only assume was a list of names. “I, um… I can’t…”<br><br>Jaleth pinched the bridge of his nose and 8386071 tensed, expecting a beating, but Jaleth motioned for him to throw the datapad back. <br><br>“My quarters are just that way,” Jaleth said, pointing. “First door on the left. Help yourself to some clothes and come back in here.”<br><br>After a moment’s hesitation, 8386071 hurried to do so. The clothing he found was so soft, and clean, and none of the fabric contained any holes. It even <i>smelled</i> clean, he thought, holding a shirt up to his nose and inhaling appreciatively. He pulled it on, marveling at how silky the fabric felt compared to the rough cloth he was used to. <br><br>Not wanting to keep Jaleth waiting, 8386071 went back to the bridge, where Jaleth was sitting, his pilot’s chair spun to face the copilot’s. <br><br>“Sit down,” Jaleth said, gesturing at the copilot seat. “I’ll read you the list for now, and you can follow along. See if you can figure out what the letters mean and all.”<br><br>8386071 sat and leaned forward to look at the datapad as Jaleth began slowly reading the names aloud.<br><br>“Aarol,” Jaleth said, moving his finger as he spoke. “Abramos. Adrinne…”<br><br>They remained drifting in Tatooine’s orbit until 8386071 was soon haltingly reading along with Jaleth, though his guesses at pronunciation left a lot to be desired.<br><br>“Lo… Loral” 8386071 sounded out. “Lor… son…” Something seemed to click and he pointed at it. “Lorson. I like this one.”<br><br>“Lorson’s a good name. Nice and strong.” Jaleth smiled. “There will be plenty of time to pick out a last name later. I’d like to get us out of here first, and then we can talk some more.”<br><br>Lorson nodded. “Sounds good to me.”</p>

            <p>...is that while Jaleth was curious enough to ask, he wasn&#39;t curious enough to find out for certain, and Lorson just had better things to do with his time. As far as they&#39;re both concerned, if he can do his job just fine, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br><br>Plus, Lorson wasn&#39;t too keen on getting snapped up by the Sith or the Jedi (this is set back in the Old Republic era) so he had other reasons for not trying to find out.</p>
