            <p>I used to have a link to a LotR essay about Faramir&#39;s characterization in the movies. It proposed that his characterization was essentially the same, that it was the differences in the way Frodo behaved that altered Faramir&#39;s movie actions.<br><br>I have lost my link and can&#39;t find it with Google, but I hoped it would sound familiar to someone here.</p>

            <p>At least, I think I do, if it&#39;s <a href="http://www.istad.org/tolkien/faramir.html">&quot;What Happened to Gallant Captain Faramir?&quot;</a> by Tinw (who has lots more interesting-looking things <a href="http://www.istad.org/tolkien/index.html">on their site</a>).<br><br>I also stumbled across <a href="http://www.theonering.com/reading-room/critical-viewpoints/faramir-is-evil-like-gandalf-is-green-in-defense-of-peter-jackson-apos-s-faramir">&quot;Faramir is Evil Like Gandalf is Green: In Defense of Peter Jackson&#39;s Faramir&quot;</a> by Jonathan on TheOneRing.net, which looks at the decision to make Faramir &quot;more dynamic&quot; from a film student&#39;s perspective. Putting the two together, I guess the conclusion is that some of Frodo&#39;s nobility was sacrificed to give Faramir more to do? Still doesn&#39;t sit well with me, but I guess it kinda makes sense.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Michael Moorcock&#39;s <a href="http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=953">&quot;Epic Pooh&quot;</a>, which takes a view of a sacred cow around these parts - LotR - that is far from complimentary. This is exactly why I think it should almost be mandatory reading for PPCers analyzing Middle-earth&#39;s gallimaufry of badfic. How can we properly criticize a transformative work if we do not have critical, thoughtful ideas concerning the original story? At least, that&#39;s the approach I&#39;m trying to take with my own missions. How successful that has been is something I leave open to interpretation.</p>

            <p>... I disagree quite vehemently with &#39;Epic Pooh&#39;. Obviously some of his points are subjective - he doesn&#39;t like Tolkien&#39;s poetry, for instance - but the main thrust of his argument is that Tolkien&#39;s style is &#39;cuddly&#39; and lacks tension. Which... I&#39;m not sure how little of LotR you have to read to get that impression. The whole trip to Crickhollow is an exercise in slowly building tension.<br><br>He also tries to claim that Tolkien&#39;s use of humour is &#39;unconscious&#39; - ie, he seems to think that all the understated comedy wasn&#39;t written deliberately - and that Tolkien doesn&#39;t take any pleasure in words. Which, when said about a man who imvented a language and then wrote a world to use it in, is pretty much the height of ridiculous.<br><br>At one point, I started on a rather scathing dissection of the essay through the mouthpiece of Terri Ryan; I never quite got it finished, but I might take it up again.<br><br>(Oh, he also complains at various points about the use of nobles, artisans, peasants, and the petit bourgeoisie as heroes. I&#39;m not entirely sure who that leaves? Because those four broadly correlate to the Upper, Lower Middle, Working, and Upper Middle classes...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t mind anyone not finding Tolkien to their taste, but as far as I can tell, that&#39;s Moorcock&#39;s whole argument: Tolkien is a bad writer because Moorcock prefers other writers. That&#39;s not an argument. A statement like &quot;Tolkien is a bad writer&quot; needs to be substantiated. Okay, you don&#39;t like rural romance—fine. But why is it <i>bad</i>? Explain, author.

            <p>If I was going to criticize Tolkien, I&#39;d actually argue that he&#39;s too much in love with words: it feels he focuses on words and language over the story, often to its detriment. So too is the case with the broader worldbuilding: it&#39;s great, but it leaves the narrative awkward and bloated.<br><br>As a result of Tolkien&#39;s approach, Middle Earth is one of the most well-developed, fleshed-out and intricate settings in all of fiction. And unlike most similarly detailed settings, it&#39;s consistent, coherent, and clearly the well-thought-out result of one vision, one mind.<br><br>However, as someone who slogged through LoTR, barely awake, and was mocked for my peers for being unable to remember the difference between Barad-dûr and Khazad-dûm, I think I can safely say that, at least from my perspective, the narrative suffers.<br><br>But maybe my biases are showing...</p>

            <p>When you get right down to it, in a universe where fictional worlds are places you can go to, what is &quot;fictional&quot;? What is &quot;real&quot;?<br><br>It&#39;s clearly all equally real. You&#39;re not gonna look someone like Agent Thoth in the face and tell him he&#39;s less real than anybody else. (I mean, you could try. Just tell me before you do it so I can make popcorn.)<br><br>But it&#39;s also clear that somebody, in some weird universe called World One for dubious reasons, wrote a book, or a film, or what have you, that purports to be the definitive record of a universe that most people in World One don&#39;t even believe exists. This is obviously nonsensical, even insane.<br><br>And what about agents who are supposedly from World One? Do they have authors? Clearly the answer is yes—but do <i>they</i> know that?<br><br>Some do, some don&#39;t. It used to be fairly common for agents to know they were just as fictional as anybody else, and to complain about the things their authors did to them. There&#39;s even precedent for agents reading the Words of their own stories in TOS 7, when Lux reads Acacia&#39;s &quot;subtitled-thoughts&quot; and nicks an arrow for her. Nowadays that&#39;s out of style, but you still get the odd duck like Jenni who is perfectly happy with the paradox of existing both as a wholly real, independent, demi-god-like entity on the one hand, and a figment of my imagination subject to my whims on the other. For her, there is absolutely no conflict with both of those things being true, depending on where you&#39;re standing at the time. Even Nume has literally glanced at the Fourth Wall once, and if pressed very hard, would probably confess that he suspects everyone has an author, including himself; he just avoids thinking about it most of the time.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s what most agents do: just try not to think about it too hard.<br><br>But that&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t have fun with it if you want to. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, rambling past her bedtime.</p>

            <p>So it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve really done anything on here, or been on the Discord (I&#39;m actually not on the Discord right now so if y&#39;all want to reach me, DM @ Quincy Jones#6104), and this is because I&#39;ve reached a point where I don&#39;t feel comfortable really interacting with the PPC at a whole. Let me explain why. <br><br>Not too long ago, I was involved in a Board issue regarding something I said over the gen chat on the Discord. People thought I was being malicious; I maintain that I was definitely not, and furthermore, I accept no accusation of wrongdoing. I am not the type of person who says things deliberately in order to hurt people. I apologize that I wrote something that may have been taken that way, but I honestly don&#39;t think I DID, and I feel as though I&#39;ve done nothing wrong and have suffered an attack out of spite. I could very well be wrong on this front, however. <br><br>You may be thinking to yourselves, &quot;Okay, but... we resolved that, didn&#39;t we?&quot; And I am here to tell you that maybe you guys have reached closure, and the issue is well and truly in the past, but I have NOT. In fact, it has been weighing rather heavily on my heart. Why? Well, I don&#39;t really know. I think it&#39;s because I never really saw a decision made on whether or not I was wrong/right/whatever, and because the person who had a problem with my posts hasn&#39;t said anything beyond the initial ping to Huinesoron, at least not to my knowledge. <br><br>The deal is, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. I have no idea if everyone hates me, if everyone loves me, if I&#39;m right, wrong... I can&#39;t sort the issue out because the person I offended hasn&#39;t said anything and quite frankly I&#39;m afraid to seek them out... and this seems to be a trend that happens a lot. I dunno if I&#39;m imagining things, but the way we seem to deal with our issues here is to bring it to the Board, argue a bunch, wait for Huinesoron to say something, and then just shut up about it and never speak of it again. We gloss over it and act like it&#39;s all okay. And maybe it is okay. Maybe most of us just move on and forget it ever happened. But I CAN&#39;T, and it&#39;s eating me alive, to the point where it makes talking to you guys and hanging out with you guys awkward and scary. I don&#39;t know what I want. I don&#39;t know what to do. But I do know that I don&#39;t want to stay silent, because even getting kicked out of the PPC is better than spending the rest of my days in limbo. </p>

            <p>Regardless of what wrongs you my attribute to yourself, most of the PPC, at least to the best of my knowledge, considers you a perfectly fine community member, and you are absolutely welcome here. And at the end of that thread, from what I saw of the resolution, I think that remains the case.<br><br>But... I mean, I don&#39;t speak for everyone. So that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

We&#39;ve all had reactions we aren&#39;t proud of, and I thank you for your apology. For my part, I&#39;m sorry I got so emotional. I shouldn&#39;t have blamed you so much for what happened; I know none of this was really your fault. I hope you can forgive me for being an idiot and lashing out at the nearest convenient target, and that we can move past this (and hopefully into a realm where I&#39;m not so terrified of you.) <br>Hoping to make amends, Quincy Jones</p>

            <p>Just so you all know, I&#39;ve finally started converting The Lost Tales to CSS. Some things (e.g. dividers, which I&#39;ve renamed to make more sense) may look a little broken for a while in unconverted areas of the site, but don&#39;t worry, everything is under control. I&#39;m starting with TOS, of course, and will work down the list from there.<br><br>If you&#39;re comfortable with CSS/HTML and want to help, let me know!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay, sheesh.  You guys are going to think I&#39;m some movie nut at this rate.  I&#39;m really more of a books-and-video-games kind of guy, but they take a lot longer for me to get through, and my friends and family have bugged me to watch movies with them lately, so uh.  Here we are.<br><br>I <i>was</i> planning to watch <i>Moana</i> eventually.  I&#39;m tragically far behind on Disney movies.  I always preferred the classic, 2D-animated style, but wow, did <i>Moana</i> sway me a bit away from that.  This movie is beyond gorgeous.  The water, the plant textures, the clouds, the hair of the characters, they&#39;re all amazingly detailed and realistic.  The one drawback to this is that the human and animal characters are still so stylized and cartoonish by comparison, they almost feel like they don&#39;t belong on the same screen as the backgrounds.<br><br>(Also, brief note going forward: I may get some of the spellings wrong up ahead, since I don&#39;t know any Polynesian languages.  But I&#39;m also not going to look them up, because I don&#39;t like my initial-thoughts reviews to get tinged with anything I read about the story on the internet.)<br><br>There are two aspects of the plot that I really liked.  The first is that the writers remained aware of the plot&#39;s weaknesses as they went, and examined it during the movie.  I&#39;m so used to accepting the hero of any given story as the &quot;chosen figure&quot; that I didn&#39;t really stop to think about Moana-as-chosen-one . . . until the character Maui actually <i>pointed out midway through</i> that the ocean choosing Moana seemed baseless, and therefore, arbitrary.  This leads to Moana having a moment of doubt, during which she is visited by her grandmother&#39;s <s>Force</s> ghost, who admits that perhaps making Moana go out on a dangerous mission by herself was, indeed, a bad thing for the ocean to have done.  But Moana, being offered the opportunity to go back, chooses to continue all the same.  And that, ultimately, becomes the real justification for the ocean&#39;s decision: it wasn&#39;t anything supernaturally or physically inherent in Moana that made her the right one for the job; it&#39;s simply the fact that she was willing to do it.  Her character, not some arbitrary magic or anything about her heritage, made her the best candidate.<br><br>The second thing I liked ties a little bit into that, actually.  The main &quot;hero team&quot; of this movie is Moana and Maui.  Moana is a teenage girl who&#39;s never been on a boat before, and Maui is a hulking, strong, agile man with shape-shifting powers and a mystical, literally god-given weapon who also knows how to steer a boat and navigate at sea.  On the surface of things, it certainly seems like Maui brings everything to the table, and the story lead me on to easily believe that the final conflict against the lava demon would be settled by Maui; that Moana&#39;s only real purpose was in un-stranding Maui so he could get back to the island the lava demon had taken over.  But the first attempt to return the stone to the island, with Maui making a frontal assault and leaving Moana in the background fails miserably, and the second hardly goes any better, with its focus on Moana getting past the lava demon.  The demon was never an enemy to be defeated or avoided, but the actual island brought to life in fury at the theft of the life-giving stone.  It was never a conflict that could be solved by violence or supernatural powers in the first place, and that makes another reason Moana was &quot;chosen.&quot;  Maui&#39;s attitude and strength would never have led him to do anything but attack the lava demon, and therefore he could never understand the true situation of the island.  It took a mortal who could be generous and forgiving to solve the conflict.  I liked that there was clearly an effort from the writers to not give this movie a violent solution, as there&#39;s certainly enough focus on solutions-through-fighting in U.S. media as it is.<br><br>One weakness of the movie is a bit of tell-don&#39;t show.  We&#39;re told in the legend at the beginning that Maui&#39;s theft of the life stone is filling the sea with monsters that preyed on boats, and that it&#39;s slowly corrupting the islands.  We do see the crops and lack of fish in Moana&#39;s village, but once she gets out on the open ocean, it feels like a pretty normal ocean.  Lots of non-fantasy wildlife, and no monsters, except in an underwater cave named the &quot;cave of monsters,&quot; which I assume already had monsters in it before the rot began to spread across the ocean.<br><br>The character of Moana&#39;s father felt a bit flat, too.  I understand the reasons the narrative gave for his attitude towards any of his village traveling too far from the island, but when all the fish have disappeared, and your crops are turning to dust, you have to get food from <i>somewhere</i>.  And since he doesn&#39;t really offer another solution, shutting down Moana&#39;s idea to fish outside the reef without any discussion feels pretty ridiculous.<br><br>I really liked Heihei (sp?) the chicken.  I know chickens are dumb, but they&#39;re at least good at aiming their beaks at food—painfully good, as I can testify from experience.  But I still enjoyed all of Heihei&#39;s mannerisms and constantly haggard look, despite the inaccuracy there.<br><br>We seem to be good at filling in the preview area with non-spoiler things, but I&#39;m going to keep making spoiler blocks, because it amuses me.  Deal with it.<br>&quot;What can I say, except, you&#39;re welcome?  For the sun, the sea, and the spoilers!&quot; &quot;What can I say, except, you&#39;re welcome?  For the sun, the sea, and the spoilers!&quot; &quot;What can I say, except, you&#39;re welcome?  For the sun, the sea, and the spoilers!&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit, easily impressed by good CGI</p>

            <p><b>Spoiler Warning:</b> Seasons one and two of <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i><br><br>* * *
<br><br>Agent Melinda May walked through the corridors with an even stride.  Even without looking anyone in the face, she could tell the other agents moving past her were avoiding looking her in the face.  Her already flat mouth became ever more pinched.  She turned a corner and—<br><br>—and halted.  The laboratory was almost completely empty, which was unusual in the middle of the day.  There was one person inside, an Asian woman with black hair in a ponytail.<br><br>May narrowed her eyes.  She didn’t recognize the woman.  She looked <i>awfully</i> young too.  May power-walked straight to the door and went inside.<br><br>“You aren’t authorized to be in here.”  She stared the strange woman in the face, watching it for minute changes of expression.<br><br>The woman looked up.  “Oh, Agent May,” she said calmly, looking up and making eye contact with May.  “Yes, actually, Agent Simmons asked me to come in and pick up some research data for her.”  She looked back down and opened a folder, flipping through papers.<br><br>The folder had been closed to start with.  Drifting closer, May quietly asked, “Why didn’t Agent Simmons come herself?”<br><br>Without looking up this time, the other woman answered, “She was operating some fancy computer program, couldn’t step away.  I volunteered to come pick up some files for her.  Do you know offhand where the data on Carl Creel’s recovered skin fragments would be?”<br><br>“Simmons asked you to get something but didn’t say where it was?”  May started slowly up the aisle between work benches that the woman was standing in.  “How unlike her.”<br><br>There it was.  A tiny wince in the woman’s cheek.  Lying.  “I guess she wasn’t certain where the files were?  Someone else may have been—”<br><br>“Agent Simmons knows where all her files are.”  May’s voice was low, very nearly a growl.  “You’re a HYDRA agent, and you’re coming with me.  Right.  Now.”<br><br>The woman stepped back a bit, getting clear of the lab tables that had enclosed her.  Fear and confusion played across her face: the confusion forced, but the fear plenty real.  “HYDRA?  No, I—I’m S.H.I.E.L.D.  Look!”  She turned her shoulder to May, displaying the eagle logo on her coat.<br><br>“Yes, I’ll be confiscating that uniform as well.  I’m sure the real agent you took it from will be wanting it back.  And you’d better <i>pray</i> that I find them still alive.”<br><br>The HYDRA agent made a quick movement towards the aisle on the left.<br><br>May crouched down and waited.<br><br>Sure enough, the HYDRA agent pivoted quickly on one heel and reversed directions, using the edge of the work table to quickly turn into the aisle on May’s right.<br><br>May ducked under the table and rose on the other side in one fluid motion.<br><br>The HYDRA member hesitated for a second, then ducked back under the same table May had just gone under.<br><br>Two big mistakes.  May was close enough now.  She grabbed the edge of the desk and swung her legs under diagonally, catching the HYDRA member’s ankles between her own and twisting.  The HYDRA agent went down as she tried to come out the other side.  Her reflexes were good enough to bend her torso, keeping her face from connecting with the edge of the next table.<br><br>May ducked under the table again, grabbing the woman’s right arm as she began crawling forwards.  The woman tried to roll to her left to free the arm, but May pushed forwards and pinned it against her back.  She then moved her legs over those of the HYDRA agent, pinning her fully to the floor.  The woman flailed her left arm and her head a bit, but couldn’t fight back with her range of motion so limited.  She spoke up. “All right, she got me.  Turn it off.”<br><br>May furrowed her brow.  She had just enough time to demand “What?” before the Playground laboratory disappeared, and the artificial intelligence of Melinda May vanished along with it.<br><br>Agent Vania stood up in the empty holodeck chamber and stretched.  “May is just too <i>good</i>.  Can’t talk her down, can’t outfight her.”<br><br>As Vania exited the room, the DoSAT technician working the controls said, “Good decision, not giving her the Berserker Staff.”<br><br>Vania shuddered.  “Perish the thought.  All right, Doc, you’re up.”  She shrugged off the S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform jacket.<br><br>Doc looked up from <i>The Tommyknockers</i>, a look of rising horror on his face.  “Me?” he squeaked.  “But.  You’re our combat person.  And.  I don’t do that.  And.  And.  I’m in a really exciting part right now!”<br><br>“Our time block’s almost up.  You’re doing the last one.  And it’s not about combat; if you do it right, there shouldn’t be any fighting.  You talk your way out, just like you would interact with the actual canon on a mission.”  She checked that a bookmark was between the pages before closing the book and pushing Doc inside, ignoring the slight hissing sound he was making under his breath.<br><br>The technician asked, “He doing May, too?”<br><br>Vania made a most curious noise.  “No.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  <i>Lord</i>, no.  Give him . . . uh, let me think here . . . Oh!  Duh!  Give him Fitz.”  She balled up the coat and tossed to Doc through the door.<br><br>The technician made a face.  “The scientist?”<br><br>“Baby steps, all right?”<br><br>“All right.”<br><br>“Uh, but make it during the time when he was suffering from brain damage.”<br><br>The technician paused, shrugged, and adjusted the program.<br><br>The Playground’s laboratory sprung up around Doc.  Agent Leo Fitz was hunched over some files at one of the work tables.<br><br>“Uh.”  Doc looked down and hurriedly shrugged on the coat.<br><br>Agent Fitz looked up when he heard Doc speak.  “Um, can I, um,” he muttered.  He balled a hand and closed his eyes for a moment.  He finally finished, “Do you need something?”<br><br>“Uh.”  Doc swallowed.  “I, um.  Agent . . . Simmons!  Sent me to pick up some files.<br><br>Outside the simulation, Vania facepalmed.  “Of course, it doesn’t help that he doesn’t know the canon.”<br><br>Fitz’s eyes brightened for just a moment before his brow furrowed again.  “Simmons!?  Simmons isn’t . . . um.  Simmons isn’t . . . Simmons is gone.”  He began to rise.<br><br>“What?  Oh.  Sorry, I meant—”<br><br>But that was when Fitz hit Doc with a round from an I.C.E.R. gun, and he fell paralyzed to the floor.<br><br>Outside, the technician stared.  “Yeah, okay.  Your partner is really in need of more training.”<br><br>Vania sighed.  “I’m working on it, all right?”<br><br>—doctorlit likes AoS the best out of the entire Marvel Cineverse, personally, and he ships FitzSimmons hard</p>

            <p>First I was like &quot;Huh, doc&#39;s going for fanfic. Cool.&quot;<br><br>Then I was like &quot;Nah, there&#39;s a twist coming.

            <p>Because I&#39;m slow and sometimes things have to cook in my head awhile before I can do anything with them.<br><br>Prompt: &quot;When will I see you again?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>“It would be you.” Sebrin stood in the doorway to the journeymen’s barracks with his arms folded and his blue eyes narrowed with a disapproving frown. “Some people just have all the luck.”<br><br>Ezerik ignored him. He was busy gleefully throwing everything he owned into a haversack. It wasn’t much: a few respectable sets of clothing; a crude model of his father’s schooner, the <i>Zephyr</i>; and, most importantly, his harp, specially padded and wrapped in oilcloth. It was the second-best instrument he had, and the first of his make good enough to qualify for a stamp of approval from old Master Jerint. Maybe he wouldn’t get much use out of it, but he couldn’t bear to leave it behind.<br><br>Some of the other first-year journeymen clustered around him, joined by a couple of senior apprentices who were daring to risk a tardy arrival to their lessons just to see him off.<br><br>“And some people should keep their sour grapes to themselves,” said Hessrian, a blond, smooth-cheeked boy who had been devoted to Ezerik since he’d stopped Sebrin picking on him. At twelve, Hessie had been little and scared, but in three Turns he’d shot up in height and learned to hold his own against the older lads.<br><br>Ezerik was proud of him. “You tell him, Hessie.” He straightened up from his cot and looked around to make sure he wasn’t missing anything.<br><br>All he saw was the familiar faces of those around him. In all the excitement, it hadn’t really hit him yet that he was leaving them all behind, but the way they looked at him, with a mixture of pride and envy and sorrow, struck his heart. The Harper Hall had been his home, his family, for six Turns, fully one third of his life. When he had earned his journeyman’s knots and walked the tables to the cheers and applause of his fellows, just a few months ago, it had been the greatest moment of his life, and he had thought it could only be surpassed by gaining his mastery in time. Now that dream was over.<br><br>Another one had taken its place. He would miss his friends in the Hall, but it wasn’t the end of the world—it was a new beginning. He would make sure.<br><br>“Listen, Hessie,” he said, putting a hand on the younger boy’s shoulder. “You’ll look after the little ones for me, won’t you? Don’t let bullies like Sebrin push them around.”<br><br>Sebrin snorted. He hadn’t bothered anyone in Turns. Since Ezerik had thumped him the second time, he’d saved his quarrels for his cocksure young rival.<br><br>Hessie nodded. “I won’t.”<br><br>“And I’ll be sure to tell Quinya you said goodbye, since you can’t,” Sebrin added with a smirk. “You horrible heartbreaker. She’ll be devastated. I’ll probably have to comfort her, all night.”<br><br>Ezerik chuckled, shaking his head. “Quinya has better sense than that. She’ll be happy for me. You all will... won’t you?”<br><br>The others nodded and gave him their assurances: they were thrilled, of course. One of them being chosen was an honor that reflected on them all, and the younger ones could still dream that one day, it might be them.<br><br>A loud, brassy bugle from the quadrangle made them all jump.<br><br>“That’s your ride,” said Sebrin, finally moving out of the doorway. “You’d better run.”<br><br>“Yeah.” Ezerik pulled on his coat, though the day was warm, and threw his haversack over one shoulder. “Well... good-bye, then.”<br><br>Hessie put a hand on his arm. “When will we see you again?”<br><br>“I don’t know.” Ezerik grinned, and his hazel eyes gleamed with excitement. “But if you do, you’ll have to look up, because I’ll be on the back of a bronze dragon!”<br><br><hr>
<br>Ezerik is, of course, known by another name these days. He&#39;s been gaining some actual backstory lately. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I love all the little details you drop into the narration.  Without having read any <i>Pern</i> yet, it&#39;s still clear to me that this scene is taking place in a detailed setting, and not some generic fantasy camp.  It gives the sense that I&#39;m looking at a point in a timeline, for all the characters present, and not juts a standalone moment with no context.<br><br>Also, very cool to see Derik in his &quot;canon&quot; days, before the eventual badfic settled over him and turned him all Phantomy.<br><br>—doctorlit, totally going to start <i>Pern</i> eventually</p>

            <p>The Harper Hall is one of the most detailed places in the series. And your mentioning it made me realize I mucked it up—journeymen have their own private dorms.

            <p>It took me a few minutes to catch up to the &#39;right, that&#39;s *Derik*&#39; realization (it&#39;s been a while since I read anything Pern, so I very much needed the note at the end to get me thinking in the right direction about Dragonrider name changes), but...yeah, that was a fun read. :) Also kind of sad, in a way--I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve *ever* seen him that happy or excited in his adult life. For good reason, of course, but the contrast makes for a bit of creeping sadness in this scene.<br><br>All in all, nicely done. The dialogue was good, and the characters have enough detail that they feel like people we just haven&#39;t seen much of yet, rather than cardboard cutouts differentiated mainly by name. It&#39;s also just pleasant writing to read, as is pretty much anything of yours I&#39;ve ever read.<br><br>...I *am* wondering what Ezerik&#39;s *first*-best instrument is, though.

            <p>That&#39;s his voice, of course. Who made it is debatable, but Master Shonagar certainly had a hand in fine-tuning it. {= )<br><br>I&#39;m glad you got that emotional dissonance, because the contrast between how Ezerik was as a youth and how Derik is now is something I really wanted to show with this.

            <p>Well, I enjoyed this a lot. I mean, I don&#39;t know Pern at all, so I don&#39;t think I fully understand it, but I did enjoy it.<br><br>Not really much else to say. Don&#39;t have any real criticism at the moment. Sorry...<br><br>Anyways, the one other funny thing is the entirely unintentional parallels between this response and my own response to it, something Nesh pointed out long before this response was published (heck, it might have been before MY response was published), which I forgot, and then rediscovered when I read this and realized that yeah, the parallels were there. I think it&#39;s partly that this prompt just generally pushes in the direction both Nesh and I went, and also that some parallels existed in the lives and histories of Thoth and Derik (honestly, these tropes are really common. I think the main reason I picked up in it here is that Derik is a character I know better than most of the others involved in prompt responses). I dunno. But I found it amusing nonetheless. Moreso for the kind of odd friendship that seems to be forming between the two.</p>

            <p>Your response to this prompt is what pushed me into really thinking about what Derik&#39;s honorable selection into his elite fighting force was like, but yeah, the basics were going to be the same no matter what. And it&#39;s still fun. ^_^ One similar detail that&#39;s just a straight-up coincidence is the &quot;older than most&quot; thing. Thoth had to be older because of his relationship with Erek; I always knew Derik was older because he had to be a journeyman harper first. Per his story of getting Threadscarred in the Halloween RP, I knew he was 19 then, which placed him at 18 when he was Searched.<br><br>The rest came from thinking about who he is at heart, under all the damage.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The man who was Kannan, in a real sense, doesn&#39;t exist anymore. There are fragments of him, but circumstances made Thoth a different man, if he is a man at all (I like to think that he is, even if he doesn&#39;t, but that&#39;s getting into understandings of what the Astartes are and I am already wandering pretty far afield, here...). Heck, Kannan would probably be horrified by Thoth as he is now.<br><br>This is, I think, where the big differences come in. Erik was always, fundamentally, on the side of good. 40k... doesn&#39;t really have good, not exactly. Even 30k&#39;s pretty iffy. And... well, to quote the Ahriman trilogy, &quot;We are falling, and light is but a memory.&quot;<br><br>However, setting effects people. And the PPC is bringing to light aspects of Thoth that haven&#39;t been allowed to surface for millenia. Which is probably odd for him, and the fact that he&#39;s incredibly far outside his native context doesn&#39;t help. He may regain some semblance of what he lost.<br><br>What can I say? I like happy endings. And I also am not a fan of any setup that doesn&#39;t allow for the odd bit of straight-up Fun.</p>

            <p>Duck left. Shotgun, machinegun, grendade… Dead again. Restart. Okay, this time right, grenade first...<br><br>Thoth walked in. Tom closed the program. “Hey, Thoth! Where’ya been? I’ve just been… ahh… training. In a combat simulation.”<br><br>“In fact,” said Thoth, “I have been training as well. After my failure in our prior mission, I have been practicing my mental focus. And I have an initiate to train.”<br><br>“You mean Derik?” Tom laughed. “Seriously, what are you two, married?”<br><br>“It takes dedication to truly develop through training. I must keep my skills sharp, and Derik has made significant progress,” said Thoth coldly. He wasn’t even going to dignify Tom’s jab with a response.<br><br>“Yeah, yeah,” said Tom, grinning. “Anyways, what were you doing?”<br><br>“Aside from focusing the mind developing my psychic talents, as well as training my initiate in the same, I have a strict exercise regimen, and practice daily with both long-range and melee weapons. It is important to keep my skills in place.”<br><br>Tom shrugged. “Well, I did some experimental work on trying to get demons to do even more work for me, and then decided to do a bit of reflex and combat training in a simulator.”<br><br>Thoth walked behind Tom, to get a better angle on what he’d been doing. “Yes,” he said, his voice utterly serious. “I am certain that this ‘Half-Life’ is an excellent combat simulator.”<br><br>“It is!” replied Tom, indignantly.<br><br>“Well, then. Perhaps you should face me. Test your simulator-developed skills in the real world.”<br><br>Tom paused for a moment. “Thoth?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Not another word.”<br><br>--<br><br>((PPC&#39;s not mine, Warhammer and Laundry Files aren&#39;t mine you know the drill, Thoth and Tom are mine, Derik belongs to Nesh, who said I could use him.))</p>

            <p>My favorite part of this is that first paragraph.  The run-on sentences, with the chains of commas, work well to show that we&#39;re seeing Tom&#39;s thought process in regards to the actions he&#39;s taking in the game, before the more proper sentences of the next paragraph take over again to express actual, physical action.  Even though Tom isn&#39;t speaking that paragraph out loud, I feel it also works as a stylistic counterpoint to the way Thoth describes his training later, with much more detail and more formal sentence structure.<br><br>Nitpicks: <i>Half-Life</i> should be italicized.

            <p>&quot;So, we&#39;ve got a new player this evening, everyone. This is Cassie, she&#39;s a DMS agent, and I&#39;d like to welcome her to the Coterie of Light. Say hi!&quot;<br><br>A chorus of muted &quot;Hi&quot;s greeted Cass as she shuffled her feet. Her hair hung down over her face like the shutters on a corner shop, and after a few moments of immense internal struggle, she said hi back.<br><br>&quot;Doctor Peep, is she here because of what happened with Bill?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, Gabrielle, that entirely depends on how much you enjoyed playing in a party with Supreme Commander Murdertron, Chief Eye-Gouger of the Army of Extra Deadly Death.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Welcomewelcomewelcome! Come sit next to me! Would you like some snacks? My partner made everybody snacks. He&#39;s kinda like that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; Cassie said. Then &quot;Thank you.&quot; Then &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but how are you allowed to be that fluffy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aw! Thank you! I&#39;m a Flareon is why, but it&#39;s also because people brush me and snuggle me when I&#39;m on the wards. I&#39;m a therapy Pokemon with the MPND Clinic, but Doctor Peep is my therapist too!&quot;<br><br>Gabrielle beamed. Cassie nodded back, her eyes a little wide. &quot;Er. Okay. That&#39;s... nice?&quot;<br><br>&quot;So who are you playing? I&#39;m the cleric, because making people not hurt any more is awesome!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um. Valiant Cavalier. It&#39;s a paladin subclass. More, um, hitty. And his name&#39;s Thorin. And he has a bear. Doctor Peep said it would be okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank heavens, an actual tank,&quot; piped up Eloise. &quot;I&#39;m sick of getting slapped about because Bill thinks it&#39;s funny to watch the wizard get into close combat.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>It took a few minutes to get everyone settled in, but eventually the group was all set. It was a motley assortment, and Cass was the only human at the table; T&#39;viq was a Reman, Eloise was a drider, Sugi was a bonsai Ent, and the DM, Doctor Peep, was a six-foot animatronic duck. The campaign, Gabrielle explained, had been going on for some time, mostly in spite of a recovering Gary Stu called Bill who was a total edgelord and kept trying to screw things up for the party. Before Gabrielle could go any further on why Bill was a complete butt, Doctor Peep loudly announced the setting.<br><br>&quot;After the tragic death of Supreme Commander Murdertron, your characters have returned to the manor at Thandallyn to train and generally relax. A few months have passed without incident... until now. A mysterious stranger is at the gates of the house.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I go to the window and try to get a look at them,&quot; said T&#39;viq. &quot;Such work is suited well for elven eyes, especially those of a ranger. Plus I&#39;m just generally a bit nosy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, roll me perception.&quot;<br><br>Clatter.<br><br>&quot;Smeg.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Astarael, you gaze long and hard, and form a really excellent and in-depth mental picture of the wall you&#39;re staring at. Is anyone else doing anything?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh! Sure!&quot; Gabrielle smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll go down to the gate. And bring pie. Everybody loves pie.&quot;<br><br>A chorus of laughs around the table. Cass sagged a bit, stayed quiet.<br><br>&quot;Okay then, Drake. You go out to the gate and see a heavily armoured figure on the back of a cave bear. The rider is even shorter than you are, which is saying something for a halfling.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ho there, stranger!&quot; Gabrielle cried in as manly a voice as a fluffy red bunny could manage. &quot;What brings thee to Ascalon?&quot;<br><br>There was silence for a bit, then Cass spoke. &quot;Er. Dwarven business! Yes. Definitely. Nothing to do with anything gobliny or stuff like that. My name is Thorin of the Green Beard, and I seek audience with noble heroes who mayst use the service of a strong and righteous sword arm! Verily, &#39;tis a fine time to be a dwarf of my lineage, and definitely not a day to be a goblin in some scrounged up armour with a load of cave moss glued to his face, why would you even assume such a person would be here?&quot;<br><br>There was a very long pause.<br><br>&quot;Cassie, is Thorin a goblin pretending to be a dwarf?&quot; Doctor Peep asked.<br><br>&quot;What possible reason could you have to suspect such a thing of the noble Thorin Greenbeard, dwarf adventurer and in no way a goblin whose face is covered in lichen that&#39;s really itchy underneath this plate mail?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... You&#39;re going to fit riiiiiiiiiight in around here.&quot;<br><br>Cassie smiled, and believed her.</p>

            <p>I never had a campaign quite like this—most of the funniest stories came from other people&#39;s games; Phobos has some great ones—but still. I would hang out with these people, and occasionally bring the Oreos. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I just find it amusing that all these fantasy creatures would gather together and play 4E D&amp;D as DMed by an animatronic from the FNAF games. In point of fact, I&#39;ve actually statted up Thorin - goblins make surprisingly okay paladins - and am using him as part of the B Squad, which is my backup characters in the 4E game I&#39;m playing at the moment. There&#39;s Thorin &quot;Definitely Not A Goblin&quot; Greenbeard (goblin Valiant Cavalier), Astarael Meadowclear (transgender hobgoblin ranger), and Cedric the Suicidal Skeleton (eladrin Iron Soul monk who just so happens to be an skellington, on account of being dead for the past nine hundred years). This is to go with my main character, Geraldine Snodgrass (shardmind barbarian obsessed with pulp fantasy novels).<br><br>Games with me in them tend to be slightly odd, is what I&#39;m driving at here. =]</p>

            <p>Harris was strewn across the leather couch. There he lay, in front of the T.V., and behind the coffee table.

            <p>Ix pointed her finger at the candle in front of her, eyebrows drawn together as she focused.

            <p>Yay, an Iximaz mission that not into a canon I&#39;m planning to consume eventually, so I can read it without spoilers!  <s>Because that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t been commenting on a lot of your other missions lately, if you noticed I wasn&#39;t, but you probably didn&#39;t notice and I&#39;ve been making too much of it in my mind but I was afraid of insulting you but I didn&#39;t know how to bring it up without sounding weird and</s><br><br>I know I&#39;ve mentioned on some of the recent Ix-and-Char stories how fun it is that Ix gets to be the stronger, more experienced one now that Charlotte has become human.  But I only realized reading this story how valuable it&#39;s going to be for Ix&#39;s self confidence to shift their focus from their own perceived failings, and to focus more on helping Charlotte become stronger.  Which will also make their relationship closer!  Yay!<br><br>I was going to say something about testosterone not automatically making people easily turned on, but then I remembered that I&#39;m ace, and have no idea how testosterone works in that department.  (It works fine for me in the <i>other</i> department.  I scared a whole bunch of my coworkers yesterday because they overheard me screaming at boxes of produce.)<br><br>—doctorlit, screaming at inanimate objects with regularity</p>

<li>I wonder whether or not the choice of link text is significant ...<br>- Ok, those Overwatch usernames are nice<br>- The swordfighting training was a cool thing, and you did a good job of showing Charlotte&#39;s level of being in shape compared to Ix<br>- ... omai? I think that next bit gets an omai.<br>- I&#39;m with Lotte on the &quot;not getting shot&quot; thing<br>- Oh, man ... those transitions. inb4 Charlotte gets knocked out by one<br>- Narrator, stop acknowledging the innuendos I had in my head :P<br>- Ok, I&#39;m not following the dress code thing<br>- Oh ... nvm, I didn&#39;t notice the hair thing in the fic. That makes sense new (a few paragraphs later)<br>- Ok, that&#39;s a clever execution method <del>which is going to fail now that you&#39;ve mentioned it on page</del><br>- Awww. Ix/Lotte in the Jack conversation is cute<br>- The middle of a dangerous mission is a perfect time for a snogging session, I&#39;d say<br>- Wow, this Sue&#39;s massively flip-floppy characterization.<br>- Ok, that Ix/Lotte flirting with the accent ... sexy interlude when? :P<br>- High speed broom chase?<br>- Looks like I didn&#39;t need to wait for an interlude :P<br>- Took me a moment to figure out that &quot;part of a dream&quot; was the Sues&#39;s dream<br>- Ok, Jack is funny<br>- Oh my, that ending ...<br><br>Review: Ok, so that was overall good. You got in a bunch of relationship development for Ix and Charlotte.<br><br>One complaint I have is that you hammered in the inconsistent characterization of the Sue a whole lot, comparatively, but that could be because it&#39;s the major persistent issue.

            <p><i>Torchwood</i> atmosphere or testosterone? Fwai appeared to be more confident before they entered the fic, so it must have been the latter? Or there may be factors at play that Fwai doesn&#39;t even think about, like positive effects of having come out (was this only recently?), or Lottie being less overwhelming now that she&#39;s struggling with being human. Looks like a perfect reason to reread the whole story arc trying to see the greater picture, and now that I&#39;m no longer working to earn a living, I may even find the time to do it. Or I may just be looking for another pretense to still not start my own spin-off :-)<br><br>OT: Also, the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies would like to inform you that there is a small inaccuracy in &quot;Neverfree From Working&quot;, spilled over from the RP. Richard Legard saying &quot;Now, the Cafeteria, you said?&quot;, apparently in response to Ajax sending Desdendelle and the Librarian to the cafeteria, doesn&#39;t make any sense. A more reasonable version of that dialog, changing about three lines, may be found at the end of Hardric&#39;s mission <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I6S3qRhJ53YV1qX5cgzCiJiAW7lvwat5McK-oKGZEOw/edit">Backside of the Canon</a>. After one year, I finally got around to tell you this. <br><br>HG, procrastinating.</p>

            <p>I went ahead and cleaned up Neverfree. Has it really been a year since that happened? Yikes.<br><br>Agent Ix came out during the last interlude I wrote, so it was pretty recent. As for the confidence—a lot of it is starting to accept herself for what she is, but also, I think, getting into the role of a teacher. Charlotte&#39;s not the deadly killing machine she used to be, so Ix is having to step up and whip her into shape, which doesn&#39;t leave her a lot of time to second-guess herself when her partner&#39;s life is on the line.<br><br>(And since her experiences are mirroring mine, I did feel generally more assertive while on testosterone, so make of that what you will.)<br><br>Thanks for the review. :)</p>

            <p>There are... I&#39;m gonna say literally <i>millions</i> of bad fanfics out there, and hundreds if not thousands more going up every day. It&#39;s a physical impossibility for us to do missions into them all. The PPC (organisation) can, of course, make an effort at it (though they fail miserably); for us it&#39;s completely meaningless.<br><br>We&#39;re here to have fun. If one of the myriad stories that is potential PPC fodder is inappropriate for some reason, just... don&#39;t report it. :) Remember, &#39;bad enough [for a mission]&#39; doesn&#39;t actually require it to be the most brain-breakingly squicky thing you can find; TOS never delved into NSFW territory (at least not while Acacia was around), and a lot of the best missions out there are the ones into seemingly-bland stories that just have so many maddening twists away from sanity and logic that the missions come out hilarious. (Conversely, I think C<em>l</em>br__n was one of my <i>worst</i> missions, because Dafydd and Connie basically devolved into yelling &#39;argh, that&#39;s so wrong!&#39; at everything.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Just because the name of a fic is inappropriate doesn&#39;t mean the fic is squicky. Some people&#39;s every other word is an F-bomb or similar. (That&#39;s exaggeration, but still.) I have proof of this (aka my &quot;wait, how the heck did we become friends, again?!&quot; friends). What if there&#39;s a fic called &quot;Mary Sue&#39;s ****in&#39; Awesome Adventure&quot; or something like that?<br><br>-Twistey</p>
