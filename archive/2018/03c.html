            <p>Hello! This will be unnecessarily long and rambly and poorly formatted.<br><br>I am a new poster, and this... uhh... forum?  Message board? Whatever it is, it looks interesting.  I have heard from distant lands (aka the discord page) that it&#39;s good to introduce yourself on this board, and that creating an account is not actually necessary, contrary to all rational logic in the universe.  (Now I have an excuse to procrascinate more.  Yay procrascination!)<br><br>So, introduction.  I really enjoy LotR (yes, including Silm and HoME and others), Foundation series, Robot series, Culture series, Warhammer 40k (I can&#39;t actually afford the figurines, though, and GW is screwing everything up again dammit), the Elder Scrolls, Minecraft, and several others that I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head.  I&#39;m also something of a grammar nazi, though I may or may not suck at spelling myself without a spellchecker.  <br><br>I found the PPC via a link from the internet forum that I frequent the most to TvTropes, where there was another link linking me to a list of terribadfic that had  a link to the PPC wiki where I read for a bit, and then decided to join the message board (I admit, though, I didn&#39;t exactly have high hopes about this being active, seeing as I read somewhere about the PPC being disbanded years ago.  I was wrong.)  <br><br>My favorite mission/agents are probably the ones from the original series, seeing as I may or may not have not read much of the other ones apart from Celebrian (which left me seeking brain bleach).  Reccomendations, plz?<br><br>That&#39;s about it, I think.  Hopefully.</p>

            <p>(Yeah, I was writing some... stuff.)<br><br>Hi, I&#39;m Twistey. I&#39;m a derp with too many fandoms and a lot of original worlds. Minecraft being one of the fandoms, I plan to make mods and maps sometime. Hey, I take it you too are proof that not every Minecraft fan who&#39;s active enough to state their fandom is an immature kid/bad endergirl OC factory, so high five.<br><br>Do you have any agent ideas? What do you plan to do with your time here? I&#39;d like to know?<br><br>As for your newbie gift, here&#39;s a flask of purple liquid. Drink it if you need a brief period of invincibility against being Sued in certain ways, but don&#39;t depend on it too much, because it might mistake some perfectly fine characters for Sues because they have a few shared traits.<br><br>Welcome to the PPC! Have a great time here!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Have one of my own shed feathers and a complimentary kit of Spikes!<br><br>And if you&#39;ll excuse my being self-serving, there&#39;s my own PPC writings if you&#39;re interested in explorations of continua that weren&#39;t previously visited in the PPC, and I especially recommend starting with Falchion and Rashida due to them being my first pair. &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Sj_VpYzdbYNcsfLA7C1ylDYRpbjh55Ii-PhEwifOg4/edit?usp=sharing">Connecting The Dots</a>&quot;, my very first PPC mission published, is still one of my absolute favorites for sentimental value, though it might not be the best place to start if you aren&#39;t fond of fetishes, gore, and eleven different continua smooshed together. :/ A lot of other missions of mine require a bit more context to get up to speed on, but another rec from my archives is &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nFPwjpdFbfdkMyBi42BZW72uUii3wUbnRNGkIeeMak/edit">In Other News, Water is Wet</a>&quot;, co-written with Voyd, which we tried to write as a relative standalone and is still one of the missions I am most proud of. Ditto for my most recent collab mission, &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsNSgm4wJTtbXHtoJrM19sH6XMNQRP0keFn_2cXUadA/edit?usp=sharing">Girls&#39; Night Out</a>&quot; with eatpraylove and James Shields, for the same reason (though that one may still take quite a bit of Steven Universe canon knowledge to understand).<br><br>And as for recs of other PPC writers... Florestan and Eusabius, full stop. One of the first RCs I archive-binged and still one of my favorites, they&#39;re the reason I wanted to write a DIC team in the first place and their characterization is hilarious and awesome. Kinda sad that I haven&#39;t seen any new missions from them since late 2013...</p>

            <p>Jeez, you guys. Such flattery. ^_^;<br><br>But look, you can&#39;t read &quot;Ring Child&quot; without reading <a href="https://bronzeclockwork.livejournal.com/1229.html">Tungsten Monk&#39;s stuff</a> first. It&#39;s frelling brilliant to this day, and Tungsten is an actual honest-to-goodness published author now, so she&#39;s objectively way cooler than me. Go! Read!<br><br>And, like, ideally read the previous missions in the RC 999 spin-off first, too. And maybe &quot;Gestalt Therapy,&quot; if not the original 2008 Macrovirus Epidemic/Sue Invasion stuff. I don&#39;t think &quot;Ilraen&#39;s Journal&quot; quite covers all the important details. The only mission of mine I&#39;ve actively attempted to make sensible without prior context is &quot;Blood Raining Night&quot; because it&#39;s legendary-ish, and seriously, don&#39;t start there.<br><br>Anyway, welcome to the PPC, HeraldicBanner!

            <p>So, I came to a startling realization recently. It has been almost two whole years since I last read a book. Now, I&#39;ve cracked open a book or two, started reading, only to find myself stopping and playing video games instead. This cannot stand. So, in my efforts to get back into literature, I would like some recommendations. Anything you&#39;ve been reading recently? What&#39;s been taking your attention recently.<br><br>Also, due to a certain game about a literature club, I&#39;ve found myself more interested in poetry. So, if you have any poets to suggest, throw them out there too.</p>

            <p>A relatively obscure book: Ransom, by David Malouf, which is a rewriting of the last parts of the Iliad - specifically, the events of the Trojan king, Priam, travelling to Achilles to buy his son&#39;s body from him, and give him a proper burial. It&#39;s a plot I wish I came up with first and darn you Homer, you sneaky git. <br><br>It is easily my favourite fantasy (if, er, that&#39;s correct to call it?) story of all time. It&#39;s as beautiful as I remember having read it (read it for school, in fact, as a set text!) and even better, being that I understand the whole thing more clearly. <br>It is a sad, brilliant story, and it all goes into exploring the relationship of death and life, and of mortality and what being mortal means, and so on and so forth. <br><br>Achilles and Priam are both greatly detailed characters - broken, flawed men, in different ways, but ultimately more similar than either of them realise. It has such a bleak tone and feel and conclusion, but, at the same time, is incredibly uplifting, as it were. It&#39;s one of the only fantasy stories I&#39;ve read that&#39;s touched me, in that sort of manner. <br><br>Also, it is a <i>tiny</i> book. Only 200 or so pages. <br><br><br><br>And for poems, I am deeply in love with the works of Coleridge, and also T.S. Eliot. I recommend the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which feels like a fantasy story before everyone started ripping off Tolkien, and Kubla Khan, which feels just as surreal and fantastical, if a lot shorter and easier to ingest. <br><br>T.S. Eliot took me a bit to get into but, man, is he brilliant. I consider his Preludes to be some good stuff - it&#39;s basically just a series of descriptions of scenes in a city, but he creates such a fantastic mood and tone and symbolism with it. It&#39;s some of the best descriptive prose I&#39;ve seen, and it&#39;s not even a prose story! <br>The Lovesong of Alfred J. Prufrock and The Hollow Men are similar. <br>It&#39;s all pretty bleak though so, iunno, maybe play Kirby or some such after reading it. </p>

            <p>I see someone&#39;s already suggested All The Sanderson. I will second that. Because Sanderson. Especially Mistborn, which is excellent.<br><br>Also, Ciaphas Cain is a good time. So if you like 40k (or want a good way in), check those out.<br><br>Since we&#39;re talking what I&#39;ve been reading recently, I&#39;d be remiss not to mention webcomics. Because I have been reading/watching/playing/listening to the insane multimedia phenomenon that is Homestuck. Sadly... I really can&#39;t recommend Homestuck. Yes, it&#39;s FANTASTIC, but it has outrageous pacing problems. If your are not a patient person, Homestuck isn&#39;t for you. If you are a moderately patient person, Homestuck may still not be for you. And don&#39;t get me started on the problems with Hivebent that make me want to ask Andrew why he thought it was a good idea and if I could somehow travel back in time convince him to do something that doesn&#39;t break all the rules of good narrative pacing. As if the rest of the story wasn&#39;t already doing that.<br><br>For something more solidly recommendable, I go to Order of the Stick, which is funny and heartwarming and cathartic and amazing and way easier to get into than the mess that is Homestuck.<br><br>Oh, and I will once again suggest that you familiarize yourself with <a href="http://undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1">1/0</a>, AKA quite possibly the greatest piece of metafiction ever written. It is cleverly-written, with some of the best actual exploration of metafictional concepts that I&#39;ve ever really seen. It also has better narrative chops than you have any right to expect from a daily four-panel gag strip, with a genuinely smart ending and a set of well-developed characters who all have their own arcs over the course of the story. And by the end, you&#39;ll be able to identify with all of them. Yes, even the eyeball.<br><br>And over this entire thing, it still manages to be a fairly consistantly funny daily 4-panel gag strip. I cannot recommend it enough. In what other story can you ebbg sbe gur ybir orgjrra n yvgreny fgenjzna naq na rnegujbez jub pnzr bhg nf fgenvtug va qrsvnapr bs gur nhgube?

            <p>If you can get your hands on a copy of Rolfe Humphries&#39; translation of the Aeneid, it&#39;s a very good epic poem.<br><br>Also, a new translation of the Odyssey by a woman (which is the first thus published) just came out and it&#39;s lovely and a little more critical of Odysseus than usual.<br><br>In terms of contemporary poets, I love Nikki Finney, who is a queer Black woman and writes about this. You can find a few of her poems on the internet but she&#39;s also published a few collections.<br><br>And if you like comic books, I&#39;ve always had a special place in my heart for Batman The Long Halloween and Batman and Robin -- both of them are pretty quick reads and very good. </p>

            <p>Some of my favorites:<br><br>&quot;Ready Player One&quot; by Ernest Cline<br>Yes, in know, but if you like video games and 80&#39;s pop culture then this is a book for you! (I can&#39;t wait to see the movie, and forget all the haters.)<br><br>&quot;Soon I Will be Invincible&quot; by Austin Grossman <br>An somewhat different take on the superhero genre, with interesting characters and concepts. Shame there&#39;s no sequel, the universe on display is worth another look.<br><br>If you like superhero comics, I highly recommend the novelization of &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, which takes an already good story and adds more to it. The only downside is a lack of Alex Ross&#39; gorgeous artwork.<br><br>Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Scape, whether you intended it or not, that came off as rather harsh.

            <p>*flying tackleglomp*<br><br>I haven&#39;t read anything new lately—all rereads—but I&#39;d recommend the <i>Last Apprentice</i> series by Joseph Delaney. It&#39;s about witches and boggarts and things that go bump in the night, and the people who fight them.

            <p>Haven&#39;t really managed to get my brain in gear to think of it, so this is as good a time as any to break out:<br><br><b>Team Second Worst Swordsman</b><br><br><b>Fuzzball</b> the Togekiss<br><b>Snowball</b> the Glalie<br><b>Baseball</b> the Golem<br><b>Beachball</b> the Aurorus<br><b>Hardball</b> the Skarmory<br><b>Goofball</b> the Greninja<br><br>And for substitution...<br><br>the return of <b>Katie Boundary the Death Malteaser</b> (Minior).<br><br>It looks like we&#39;re at six signups now, plus I assume Iximaz, so hopefully that&#39;s enough for a tournament?

            <p>The team will come later, once I understand the doubles/single differences better... And I can choose a monotype myself (Why break this poor combo, EPL?). Like hS, I&#39;m looking for tips here, and perhaps opinions on what type choose (I&#39;m hesitating between Psy, Ghost, Dark and Fairy).</p>

            <p>I&#39;m more than willing to go play some on Showdown with my main team (that I won&#39;t be using in the tourney, that&#39;s just unfair) and either let you spectate or I can grab the recorded links and shove them on a post on here if you want (or both). It&#39;d let you see some of the more common combo&#39;s on the ladder as well as hopefully give you more of an idea of what moves to pick, &#39;mons to play.

It could of just been better, especially considering there will be plenty of phasing pokemon out there with either Roar, Whirlwind or Dragon Tail to switch you out or Haze to eliminate your stat changes. </p>

            <p>In doubles battles you&#39;ve got to consider how many pokemon your moves hit, for example moves like Earthquake, Discharge and Surf hit all the pokemon besides the user, including allies. Whereas moves like Heat Wave and Rock Slide will hit both enemies. You&#39;ve also got to consider moves like Ally Switch or Heal Pulse that are meant to target allies, not enemies and so are useless in single battles. Finally moves like Trick Room or Tailwind see a lot more use in Double battles, as well as weather conditions alongside abilities that benefit within said weather, for example Sandstorm and Sand Force, or Hail and Ice Body. </p>

This one was a Naruto Legendary.<br><br>Chunin Exam Day seems like a pretty good candidate. Published between 2007 and 2010 and still heavily referenced on various sites within the last year, it fits all the qualifications for a Legendary.<br><br>As for the fic itself: Naruto gets stuck in a Groundhog Day loop and quickly uses it to start winning over (romantically) all the ladies with massages and simple gifts. This includes adult women. He also uses it to make himself incredibly overpowered. All good characterization is tossed out the window immediately so Author tracts can begin, and the fic is just awful.<br><br>The Tropes page, with a link to the fic:<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChuninExamDay"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChuninExamDay">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChuninExamDay</a></a></p>

            <p>SPaG is generally very good, actually. Formatting isn&#39;t bad either, though it suffers when it comes to exposition tangents. Or just regular tangents. However, he has a very distinctive (and, eventually, extremely annoying) writing style, exposition *everywhere*, thesaurus abuse, barely shows anything...<br><br>As for plot...while he has a surprisingly good grasp on his million and one details (though there are definitely continuity slips in a bunch of places to go along with the times when he put something in twenty chapters earlier only to bring it back), his villains look incompetent and stupid when he claims they&#39;re not. What else...He does have some plot points that go nowhere, he--ah. That&#39;s the one.<br><br>He very, very much plays favorites. His main characters don&#39;t have anything bad stick to them. They get miraculous escapes. They get magical improvement upon magical improvement, not to mention stuff upon stuff upon stuff. There&#39;s protagonist centered morality, the mains end up looking a good deal more awful than he seems to have intended, and while this is very firmly an AU, his reading comprehension of Rowling&#39;s books...doesn&#39;t seem to have been the best. This last ranges from small details (apparently forgetting Ted Tonks is not a pureblood) to larger ones (...not even going to start with that).<br><br>He also drops in crossovers everywhere, there&#39;s a ton of author tract, and he has no sense of moderation. At all. This is apparent in Wonderland scenes, in Harry and company getting more and more and more stuff, in tricking Dumbledore into stupid ideas, in...look, in just about everything. Subtlety, knowing where to stop before something just gets unbelievable or annoying or ridiculous--there&#39;s very little sign of it.<br><br>This all makes, of course, for a frequently hilarious or just plain *weird* fic, but it&#39;s not good writing.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>This is, unfortunately, not a great time for this to come up (seeing as we&#39;re having a state of the Discord thread above), but it needs posting anyway.<br><br>When Mythcreant came to the chat to complain that they couldn&#39;t post on the Board, I figured out that their IP matched the one that Makarra (zdimensia&#39;s most recent account) had posted from. I sent them to talk to the Nameless Admin about getting it fixed, since there wasn&#39;t any immediate indication this wasn&#39;t a case of a blocked IP address being reassigned to someone who wasn&#39;t banned.<br><br>However, over the few days since then, evidence that Mythcreant is another account created by zdimensia/Bramadin/... has accumulated. A lot of it can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zwibdsjhf1N7orGj4iVYa14uTF7ZiWMiRjO2BdtVijc/edit?usp=sharing">the following chat logs, which contain just about any conversation Mythcreant was in</a>. I&#39;ve had several people point out zdimensia-like behavior (such as going &quot;they said they&#39;re autistic&quot; and &quot;they did apologize&quot; when looking over all the previous drama, showing up with agents almost immediately, knowing a whole lot of oddly-specific PPC trivia, sharing zdimensia&#39;s views on Breath of the Wild, and a certain &quot;treated unfairly to the point it might be abuse&quot; line that sounds like their thing.) in those messages.<br><br>Therefore, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that, based on their behavior (and the IP address match, especially since ISPs reassign IP addresses a lot slower than I thought they did), Mythcreant is very likely another one of zdimensia&#39;s occounts, and I propose kicks, blocks, and other such technical measures (unless Mythcreant has some very good explanations).<br><br>In other words, it looks like I was wrong about Mythcreant initially, paging the Nameless Admin.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>This was received at 3am on March 25th, which I believe corresponds to 10pm on the 24th Board time, or approximately half an hour after Delta Juliette reinstituted the IP block:<br><br><i>Bram was right... you are a bunch of close-minded narcissists that can&#39;t listen to reason when you&#39;re wrong and you punish truth.<br><br>She&#39;s already published some PPC stories.

            <p>...with regards to Zdimensia&#39;s current housing, not because I&#39;m saying your wrong but because I would like to see how you got there and confirm it myself, given the position I&#39;ve taken in this matter. My email should be clickable.<br><br>Also I suspect the reason why you were the target of the email is that, as fair as I&#39;m aware anyway, to most people you are the face of the Nameless Admin, and so, especially to people who cannot quite grasp our leadership structure (and a potentially a few who do) you are the closest thing we have to a leader. So the email was sent to you, because then you&#39;d post it and everyone would know. That&#39;s my guess anyway.<br><br>Now that&#39;s out of the way, I want to get to the meat on the matter. I&#39;m going to warn you here, it&#39;s going to read a bit like a chew out, and it&#39;s going to be negative about parts of the PPC and one Boarder in particular, but I can&#39;t make my point without it being that way and it&#39;s a point that needs to be made. <br><br>Part of me can see where they are coming from with their email, or at least the first line of it. The overwhelming negativity in this matter, so many people willing to jump on the bandwagon with what was (and maybe is) circumstantial evidence that Mythcreant is Zdimensia. Only one person willingly to step back and look at it and go &quot;You know what, what if they are telling the truth?&quot; Not to big myself up, but to point out how that would look to an outsider. To an outsider, I can see how it could look like the PPC is a &quot;bunch of close-minded narcissists that can&#39;t listen to reason when you&#39;re wrong and you punish truth.&quot; Nobody cared about the person they were dogpiling on, no one cared that, in all the countries we come from, whenever anyone is accused of anything that could be construed as going against the rules of that society they are always judged as being innocent until proven guilty, whereas here I was having to prove how they cold be innocent. Nobody seemed to care about the Constitution that they were trying to hold aloft as they dogpiled onto Mythcreant, I mean in their eyes after all it was *only* a user who&#39;d been banned before, they&#39;re not equal to a person when it comes to respecting them in the eyes of the Constitution, right? Right? <br><br>And yet, when you are in the community you can do so many things, get so many warnings and always be let off. I can think of Boarders who have hurt or harassed or upset others a multitude of times, and yet they never get more than a warning, never get told to leave the PPC for a time to cool off, or get kicked from the Discord for inappropriate comments. Yet newbies (and I&#39;m not just talking about Mythcreant here) would get permabanned for even half of it. <br><br>You want my opinion? It&#39;s not just Discord that needs to be reviewed, but whether some Boarders need to take (in)voluntary time outs as well.<br><br>Novastorme<br>Who is well aware that he may have to take some time away from the PPC once this is all said and done. </p>

            <p>Again: my only actions in this incident habe been to unblock the IP - expressly extending that benefit of the doubt - a comment clarifying how this was done, and now posting their own email to me and offering you more information to make your own judgment on. I have not done any of the things you claim, and the fact that you used global language in a post replying to me strongly suggests you feel I have.<br><br>I was prepared to believe Mythcreant was a separate person. I did not speak up on this thread for two reasons: first, that I did not want to be attacked for doing so, and second, because Mythcreant&#39;s words amd actions were setting off all the Zdimensoa flags before anyone said anything.<br><br>It is worth remembering that several of the people you are concerned about were aware of the possibility before Tomash posted. In the interests of transparency: &#39;Mythcreant&#39; mentioned Tomash in her email, so I emailled Tomash to check if he was aware of the possibility of her being Zdimensia, and whether he had reason to think she wasn&#39;t. I received an unsolicited email from Delta Juliette after Mythcreant posted to the Board, expressing the same concern; since that email contained information about events on the Discord, I quoted it (with permission) to Neshomeh, who had previously identified Zdimensia as Makkara.<br><br>I do not know who else had already gone through the process of giving her the benefit of the doubt, but being convinced by the weight of evidemce that she was Zdimensia (or acting as what Wikipedia terms a &#39;meat-puppet&#39; for her, which amounts to the same thing). But you need to be aware that people have indeed done so.<br><br>hS</p>

What I should have said, and what I meant was that &#39;nobody who posted in this thread&#39; and &#39;only one person who posted in this thread&#39; rather than blanketing the rest of the PPC as well. That being said, do you mind if I ask who you felt you would be attacked by? I am aware of the hostility shown towards you by both Zdimensia and Myth, but part of me wonders if that was what you meant. And I&#39;m sorry if that offends anyone, but it is a natural reaction for me, because I was wondering how many people would attack me for my stance with this issue. I was already formulating in my head a post in case I felt so attacked that I had to, either voluntarily or not, leave the PPC. I also feel I should apologise to Ozzielot, for my last post, given their reaction to my first post and how it may of looked when I used the terminology that I did in my previous one.  <br><br><br>However if you look at the people who had posted before the email was sent and their responses to this matter then you have Tomash, Thoth, Mikelus, Phobos, Scapegrace, Nesh, Delta and Granz all on the side of &quot;They&#39;re Zdimensia, let&#39;s ban them now.&quot; And no one who posted on any other side. The closest we get to a neutral comment is Thoth saying &quot;Myth, I continue to be skeptical that you aren&#39;t Bram,&quot; in a follow up post or Granz&#39;s complaint about the re-application of the ban in their initial post. Does that not strike you as being overwhelmingly negative, all things considered? Could that not be construed as dogpiling, whether it actually was or not? I think it may. And I think that is how I read it when I was looking at it last night. <br><br>I should of thought better of some of my fellow PPCers and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t, I hadn&#39;t really thought of Mythcreant being a meat-puppet for Zdimensia, or at least I hadn&#39;t til you&#39;d posted both of your replies. Before the first one I would have said that at worst Mythcreant was a friend of Zdimensia&#39;s who wanted to help their friend out. But now, now I&#39;m not so sure. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m honestly surprised no one else joined you in objecting to our conclusion. I do still appreciate that you did it, but at some point, you have to consider that being the lone voice crying in the wilderness doesn&#39;t make you the only sane man, but the only one who hasn&#39;t realized there&#39;s a great place to camp over the next hill.<br><br>More honesty: I wasn&#39;t totally comfortable with DJ rebanning the IP before more people had spoken up. However, there have been a number of times in recent (and not so recent) years where the PPC has been accused of not acting <i>quickly enough</i> to deal with problems. That&#39;s why I was not terribly inclined to complain about it.<br><br>Now, having stumbled on the same information as hS, my certainty that this was the right move is at 100%. We are in no way, shape, or form obligated or equipped to handle this person. It&#39;s not safe for anyone, perhaps especially including her, which I&#39;ll point out is the same conclusion we reached each time she was banned before. This feeling isn&#39;t new, but confirmed repeatedly though a great deal of experience. Even if Mythcreant <i>were</i> a friend and not Zdimensia herself, I believe she would be doing her &quot;friend&quot; a severe disservice by continuing any association between her and us.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>-Given that the last time I said someone appeared to have done something wrong, I was dramatically smacked down, I did not and do not feel it worth my misery to say anything either way. I was extremely dubious about posting the email, even.<br><br>-Of the people who you list as responding, four of the nine (including Phobos as Mr. Neshomeh) I can absolutely confirm were already thinking about it. The chat logs show that multiple other people were too.<br><br>I get what you&#39;re saying. In the two hours between Tomash&#39;s post and the conversation falling silent (for the night?) after Delta&#39;s block, no-one who didn&#39;t feel Mythcreant = Zdimensia said anything.

Dogpile? I don&#39;t think so; it&#39;s not a &#39;you should be blocked&#39; post.<br>-Phobos offered a fourth &#39;block&#39; vote, which could definitely be dogpiling. He was clearly aware of this, as he specifically asked people not to.<br>-Neshomeh could be dogpiling; it depends on whether you think the evidence she presents is new or just rephrasing of what&#39;s already been said.<br>-Scapegrace.<br>-Delta Juliette was acting as a Named Nameless Admin &amp; Discord Mod. That isn&#39;t dogpiling, that&#39;s her job.<br>-Granz was objecting to the block.<br>-I was acting as a Nameless Admin.<br>-You definitely weren&#39;t dogpiling.<br><br>The only people you can reasonably accuse of dogpiling behaviour are Scapegrace and Neshomeh, and it bears repeating that someone (Mikelus) chided Scapegrace at least for that prior to your posting, and someone else (Phobos) acted directly to <i>prevent</i> a dogpile.<br><br>&#39;Mythcreant&#39; made <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314792;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this post</a> at 9.02pm. It consists of &#39;Mythcreant&#39; repeating Zdimensia&#39;s own old excuses about why she should never have been banned, repeated in exactly the same way as she presented them. This post is 100% convincing to me that &#39;Mythcreant&#39; = Zdimensia, and assuming you accept <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314796;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Scapegrace&#39;s explanation of her first post</a>, the only people calling for a ban before that second post appeared were Tomash and Thoth. Everyone else had that, plus <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314786;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a> and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314791;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a>, to help them make up their minds.<br><br>This wasn&#39;t a foregone conclusion. &#39;Mythcreant&#39; was given a chance to respond, and she chose to use it in attempting once again to revoke Zdimensia&#39;s ban, in exactly the way Zdimensia always did. The Mythcreant = Zdimensia connection hasn&#39;t been drawn because people saw the shared IP and went &#39;better safe than sorry&#39; - it&#39;s been drawn because people looked at the evidence and concluded that they were the same person. In other words, she <i>was</i> &#39;innocent until proven guilty&#39; - but for the people who posted in the thread, there was enough evidence to prove her guilty.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-Duly noted and understood, I remember the last time. And I thank you for posting the email, it has certainly helped me make my mind up on this matter, and has at last given some form of proof in this whole matter. <br><br>-I can understand. However without the full information available to me at the time, I hope you can also see where my point of view was coming from. I had to paint a picture with what I had, and what I saw from that was not very positive or good.<br><br>-I&#39;d put the start of the dogpiling around the Scape/Mikelus/Phobos mark, with Nesh&#39;s comment then adding to the dogpile which then wasn&#39;t followed up, probably because of Phobos&#39; second post. I am aware Phobos asked for people not to (and yes, I did completely miss Mikel&#39;s post), however that was the point for me, reading it through afterwards where it felt like it was turning into such a one-sided discussion it just wasn&#39;t fair anymore. If Phobos had simply said, don&#39;t dogpile and then, after a gap went and cast his vote then I wouldn&#39;t of seen it as a dogpile, but the anti-dogpile thing, I mean even when I read it now I don&#39;t see it as a comment to stop a dogpile of people wanting to ban Myth, just a comment to stop people arguing with them instead. But that&#39;s just what I see. <br><br>-Can I just clarify what you mean by &#39;second post&#39;? Because if you&#39;re talking about Scape&#39;s second post then you&#39;re wrong. Because Nesh and Phobos both posted before that post came up, and they were both of the mind that Mythcreant needed to at least leave the Board, if not be banned from it. But even if you&#39;re talking about Myth&#39;s second post, or even the post you linked of Myth&#39;s, then Scape&#39;s inital outburst precedes both of them. <br><br>I&#39;m not going to try and deny why those posts made people think that Myth was Bram, I can kinda see why they would make that link. I just didn&#39;t myself. <br><br>And no, I do not accept Scape&#39;s explanation. <br><br>-I have calmed down since last night and this morning, and I can now see where more people were coming from. However to me, like I have said or alluded to elsewhere, that circumstantial evidence was not, and will never be enough for me. I have since come across evidence that is proof enough for me to change my opinion of Mythcreant, and thus whether they are Bram or not. I cannot any longer continue to try and claim that I believe that Mythcreant is not guilty of being Bram, that the reason Mythcreant knew Bram is because they are Bram is no longer a fringe thought in my mind. And I no longer see a friend repeating the same arguments of their friend&#39;s because that&#39;s the only arguments they know of, because those are the arguments they honestly feel are valid and just haven&#39;t been accepted yet by the other side. I... concede that a block is needed at least temporarily, as for the permaban? My mind is not made up on that one. Not yet anyhow. <br><br>Novastorme. </p>

But what I was more meaning in my last paragraph was that I believed an IP block was necessary regardless of whether Myth was/is Bram. I was saying that I have doubts over whether Myth really is Bram or not and, separately, I understand that if they the same person then they do need to be immediately blocked and banned, however even if they aren&#39;t the same person I still think it would be better for Myth to be at least blocked/banned alongside Bram. <br><br></p>

            <p>The Nameless Admin does have the power to, in clear cases, just block people without a full vote of some sort. For example, if someone start spamming ads for online pharmacies, we block the IP, delete the posts, and move on. There&#39;s no need to hold a full vote about it.<br><br>Now, in this case, we have someone, first of all, who was using zdimensia&#39;s last known IP address. This had to be <i>unblocked</i> by the Nameless Admin to allow Mythcreant to post, which was, to my understanding, done because they might not be zdimensia.<br><br>However, it became quite clear that this person was zdimensia (for another datapoint, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314782">here&#39;s some very zdimensia-like views on making people keep talking to you</a>). In my view, the fact that we were <i>re-applying</i> an IP block on what was almost certainly a user who had been banned with full constitutional process (several times) puts us right at the edge of &quot;we don&#39;t need another full vote on this&quot; territory.<br><br>I&#39;d like to note that, if it hadn&#39;t been for the whole &quot;previously blocked IP&quot; thing, a somewhat longer wait (probably not a fully counted vote unless people were objecting, but more taking a day or two to make sure people had had a chance to see the post) would have been in order. <br><br>So yeah, for me, this situation is almost one that requires a full &quot;let&#39;s wait to make sure people could get their views in&quot; discussion, but, because of the very strong evidence, isn&#39;t one.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Because at the moment it looks like you, and other people are looking at this as &#39;guilty until proven innocent&#39;. While I&#39;m looking at it as &#39;innocent until proven guilty&#39;. And like I said, I see a lot of hypotheticals and potentials, but no definite proof. I&#39;m not meaning this as an attack or anything, I&#39;m just saying that&#39;s what it looks like from my Point of View.<br><br>I haven&#39;t had any conversation with Mythcreant about this, I can&#39;t claim to be speaking the exact truth, or saying what they want me to say. But what I can say is what I see and why I don&#39;t think it means that Mythcreant is Zdimensia.<br><br>First up, the formatting. We&#39;re not the only community on the internet, and so just because what we see as unusual formatting here, does not mean that it is a mark of a specific user, heck if I actually knew how to do it on here, I&#39;d be using that bar a lot more too. Why? Because I know of several communities I am in, or have been in where the use of that bar is not only not unusual, but seen as perfectly normal. Mythcreant could have come from one of those communities, or another one like them that uses the bar like that and just used it in their posts. <br><br>Secondly the IP address, which has been covered by other people. It doesn&#39;t offer any proof, only that Zdimensia posted from the same building/area as Mythcreant on one of their accounts. <br><br>Thirdly, the logs. So first of all, with respect to the whole Name of the Wind opinion thing, I decided to look up Name of the Wind reviews on Google, and I found this: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/305264406"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/305264406">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/305264406</a></a> which, I think you&#39;ll find does indeed correspond with a lot of what Mythcreant is saying about the book, and the main character in particular. I haven&#39;t read all of the comments on the blog, so the only thing that I can&#39;t find is where someone says Kvothe is based off a D&amp;D character, but at the same time from reading the review I could see where it was coming from. <br><br>With the introduction and the questionings of what Bram did I see an inquisitive newbie who&#39;s just asking because they want to know, and this is then further matched when they say about bits of PPC knowledge that aren&#39;t common knowledge, after all what&#39;s wrong with a bit of wiki diving? I know I do it from time to time too. The comments on Zdimensia being autistic and that potentially being the reason for the communication troubles is not a opinion held by a small group of people, it&#39;s a widely accepted fact that people who are on the autism spectrum can have problems with communicating, so what is wrong with going &quot;oh they&#39;re autistic, that could be why they had trouble communicating&quot; when it is a commonly held view and fact. Just because Zdimensia&#39;s alts said it doesn&#39;t mean that everybody who says it is one of Zdimensia&#39;s alts. <br><br>Now with respect to the changing stories of how well Mythcreant knew Zdimensia, if you knew someone who&#39;d been banned or barred from a community would you openly mention it to them when you first came in and wanted them to accept you? I know I certainly wouldn&#39;t. From how I would act in a situation like that, what Mythcreant did, is perfectly normal, as people keep digging and digging reveal more and more of the truth to try and keep them happy and to let them know the truth, because Mythcreant could have easily lied and said &quot;No I don&#39;t know her, it&#39;s just unlucky.&quot; But they don&#39;t, they reveal the truth because in the end they feel like they need to. And as to Zdimensia being more and more of a problem with Mythcreant as a mediator, well we&#39;ve seen what happens otherwise, how many times has Zdimensia tried to get around the ban while hiding behind falsehoods and lies? How many other failed attempts do we not know about? How do we know that Zdimensia won&#39;t try and try again, whether we block Mythcreant or not? I&#39;ll say this. Mythcreant has provided a credible story with enough back up and support if you look for it, which is not something that Zdimensia has ever done in the past that I am aware of.<br><br>I accept that a lot of the above does not offer definite proof, but I am also aware that it, for the most part, can provide an alternate point of view when it comes to Mythcreant and their actions. Even in the best case scenario it is an unfortunate amount of coincidences and similarities between a banned user and a newbie, that could under a certain light been seen as the newbie being the banner user trying to get around said ban. If more evidence comes to light that could change my view on this case, then obviously I will review it and potentially change my status from there. But with all the evidence that we have at this moment, after I have looked through it, and done my research on it, I would say that we do not have enough evidence to say that Mythcreant is Zdimensia, and so the ban that was placed upon them is both unfair and unjust. I am not saying that they are definitely innocent, merely that we do not have enough evidence to definitely say they are guilty. And, if we are a community that can deliver justice, as I and others believed we should be, then that lack of evidence would mean that Mythcreant is innocent until proven guilty. <br><br>Novastorme</p>

            <p>I should of made this clearer when I posted this. I do not dispute a kicking of Mythcreant, what I am disputing is the permanent ban as it now means that they no longer have the ability to defend themselves in this matter in any reasonable way.

            <p>Because, at the time of your post, if I had seen it instantly and replied to it, then I would have replied defending my point of view, that at that point I had almost no doubt in my mind that Mythcreant and Bram were separate people. hS&#39;s evidence has introduced some of that doubt, but that response came almost 30 minutes after this one. So I shall respond to this first. <br><br>I am aware of what Bram did, what they put you through. I remember, because I was there. I remember because I had tried to help Bram at first when they were still allowed to post missions, and I remember because I saw a bit of myself in them. Not a lot but enough for me to want to try and help them as much as I could. I saw how any trust I had put into them was misplaced, and I saw the events that unfolded. But that&#39;s not the point of this matter, and I don&#39;t want you to have to go through any of that again, so I&#39;m sorry for the fact that you feel like you have had to bring it up again. <br><br>However, while you are so firm in their belief that they are Bram, I at the time of your response was just as firm that they were not. That meant, that yes, while I was happy to admit that Mythcreant knew Bram, I felt that it did not mean you should tar them with the same brush. Now to quote you &quot;They came here to cause trouble.&quot; No, they didn&#39;t and I&#39;ll tell you why. Pentagon, they came here to cause trouble. Toroll comes here to cause trouble. but Mythcreant? No, they didn&#39;t, they came here to get the lay of the land so to speak. They came to see what was being said about Bram, after having heard Bram&#39;s side of it, they wanted the PPC&#39;s. Ultimately I have no doubt they would of agreed with more of what Bram said than we did, but I believe they would of actually been a mediator between Brams new alias and the PPC eventually. Did they come here to be part of the community? I&#39;m not sure on that one, in some ways, yes they did and they were integrating fairly well, in others no, because their ultimate goal was contrary to the community&#39;s. <br><br>&quot;We don&#39;t want them around because they are Bramandin&quot; Who&#39;s this we and where is your definite 100% proof this is Bram? That&#39;s all I&#39;m asking for here. Unless there is something that you knew at the time you posted this that you did not want to share with the Board or me, there was no proof that this was Bram, and so I felt like it was my duty to stand up for Mythcreant, to stand up when no one else would and say &quot;Is this really just and fair? That we can ban someone because we suspect they are someone else with no definite proof?&quot; My argument was never trying to prove Mythcreant was innocent of everything, I was always trying to prove that they were not guilty of being Bramandin, by putting enough pressure on the fact that, at that time, all we had was circumstantial evidence to prove they were Bramandin, and that we should, as a community, model ourselves on being just and fair and ask that before we ban someone for some wrongdoing prove that they are without a reasonable doubt guilty of this wrongdoing not that they are without a doubt innocent. If we want to prove that we are better than people like Bram, and Grimalkinii and Toroll say we are, then we have to act like it. <br><br>Novastorme<br><br>P.S This is my opinion, all of it. And like anyone else, I reserve the right to change my opinion, especially with the information that hS has brought to light. But at the moment, all I can go off of is what I see, and so I wanted this post to be what I was going off of what I saw, what I felt and what I knew when Ix posted their response, nothing else. <br><br></p>

            <p>First, Nova, I think you make very good points for the most part. You&#39;re right; it&#39;s all but impossible to prove for a fact that Mythcreant is Zdimensia. From what I&#39;ve read, all we really have is circumstantial evidence (though there is a <i>lot</i> of that).<br><br>But I want to look at this particular thing you said: &quot;Now with respect to the changing stories of how well Mythcreant knew Zdimensia, if you knew someone who&#39;d been banned or barred from a community would you openly mention it to them when you first came in and wanted them to accept you? I know I certainly wouldn&#39;t.&quot; That&#39;s a good point and would explain a lot of Mythcreant&#39;s behavior early in the logs, but when they were asked point-blank if they were Zdimensia/Bramandin, that would&#39;ve been the time to come clean. Instead, Mythcreant made a rather callous remark about the people involved in banning Bramandin.<br><br>Also looking at the logs, Mythcreant&#39;s knowledge of the PPC went well beyond a wiki walk. They referenced spinoffs hosted on fanfiction.net, a platform from which the PPC was kicked because of the nature of what the PPC does. Those spinoffs would be difficult to find on the PPC wiki.</p>

            <p>See I was reading it as Mythcreant saying that Bram said that essentially they were banned because &#39;brown people&#39; were mad at them. The reason why I put brown people in quotes is because reading back through the logs without context it looks to me like Bram is insulting people of colour (sorry, don&#39;t quite know what the politically correct term is so went for this one. I&#39;m not trying to offend here), when the comments are made about the racist remarks. Fully reading through it it&#39;s not, but it could be construed as such. <br><br>So how I saw this was Mythcreant paraphrasing what Bram had said, rather than Mythcreant having a go at the people who had agreed to ban  Bram themsleves. <br><br>I hope that makes sense? Although to be fair we could both be misreading the comment, the only person who could tell us the true meaning of it is Mythcreant. </p>

            <p>From memory--this was one of the things Bram said at some point that was seen as problematic. It wasn&#39;t about the people who voted for a ban; iirc, it was said before the banning (of Bram; I don&#39;t remember the sequence of events, but this may have been before we knew that Bramandin and zdimensia were the same person), and ended up being taken as racist and, I believe, as another reason for the eventual ban. I think Bram&#39;s side of the story was that it had actually happened and so mentioning it was telling the truth rather than being racist. Something along those lines. Other PPCers objected to the wording and the way it was brought up, and that it was brought up at all, too, I think.<br><br>Mythcreant most likely did mean that Bram had mentioned it as a/the reason for the ban; it would stretch belief for it to have been intended to be about the banners, given the original context (where it was said about people Bram had seen IRL). However, this was not the only reason for the ban. See the relevant threads for more detail if you want it straight from the source. I think the bit Mythcreant referenced was either in one or in close proximity to one (probably the latter), too. It certainly would have been brought up in a banning thread as well, most likely with a link to the original post.<br><br>~Z, done for now. Hope that&#39;s enough context for clarity; do feel free to check it further in the archives.</p>

            <p>&quot;Those spinoffs [hosted on fanfiction.net] would be difficult to find on the PPC wiki.&quot;<br><br>Not really? Spin-offs aren&#39;t listed by platform. If you look for missions in a particular department, you get a list ordered by number of stories and then alphabetically by agent name. If you look for missions in a particular fandom, you get a list ordered by agent name or by story name. If you look through the Killed Badfic lists, you get missions ordered by fandom, then by story name. I think the chances of hitting on something on ff.net would relate mostly to how old the spin-off is, and would tend to correlate with fandoms that were popular when the PPC was new, such as LotR and <i>Harry Potter</i>.<br><br>There&#39;s also a good chance of finding missions on ff.net if you&#39;re poking into the PPC&#39;s history, checking out references on department pages and such.

            <p>I understand what you&#39;re saying, and I&#39;m sorry for putting you in the hot seat. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re obligated to be Mythcreant&#39;s advocate or anything; but I do think it is the responsibility of all members to speak out if they disagree with a procedure like this. I very much appreciate that you&#39;ve done so. Thank you.<br><br>I absolutely agree with you that we should presume innocence until guilt is proven. I believe Mythcreant was given that chance when her request for the IP to be unblocked was granted.<br><br>I think your interpretation is reasonable, and if it weren&#39;t for the history of Zdimensia repeatedly deceiving us to try to get back into the community, which you mention yourself, I&#39;d be far more inclined toward it. However, like I said in my initial post, I think the far simpler and therefore more likely explanation is that this is Zdimensia performing yet another deception with the same goal of getting back into the community.<br><br>I also agree with Ix that, even on the outside chance this <i>is</i> a different person, they immediately decided they needed to grind an axe with us over an issue we&#39;ve hashed and rehashed already, and we have no obligation to let them drag it up again.<br><br>And, for a completely subjective point, I was right when I recognized Makkara as Zdimensia the last time, by more or less the same criteria of mannerisms. (Her difficulty remembering or using the names of stories and agents, and the way she talks about them, is a particularly strong ping on my radar.) I&#39;m inclined to trust my gut on this.<br><br>This isn&#39;t me closing the debate, though. This is me explaining why I see it the way I do.

            <p>It may mean any of the following: <ul>
<br><li>zdimensia used Mythcreant’s computer while she stayed with her.<br>
</li>
<li> zdimensia brought her own computer, but used Mythcreant’s router/modem to connect to the internet (what we see is the router’s address, not a specific device within the local network).<br>
</li>
<li> While pretending to be &quot;Makarra&quot;, zdimensia used a public internet access point different from all access points she used before that, and she now uses the same access point pretending to be &quot;Mythcreant&quot;.<br>
</li>
<li> Before she became &quot;Makarra&quot;, zdimensia switched to a different provider to get a new IP address, and she is still using that.<br>
</li>
<li>Something I don’t think of.</li>

            <p>Because it was possible that Mythcreant wasn&#39;t zdimensia, I pointed them at the Nameless Admin, who unblocked them. This was a good decision. Having an innocent newbie trapped behind someone else&#39;s block would have been bad.<br><br>However, the IP match combined with the subsequent zdimensia-like patterns of behavior (which several people agreed existed), in my opinion, combined to make a case that our initial assumption that Mythcreant was not zdimensia was an error, and so the block was reapplied. That was also a good decision.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>... beyond what has already been said? Mythcreant admitting that they actually are zdimensia will probably not happen. So, the only way I can think of: ask more Boarders, who have been around at the time, to read through this thread and the chat logs linked above, and then tell us what they think.

            <p>Firstly, upon reviewing things, particularly this thread, I think this is accurate, and I would ask that zdimensia stay away, in large part because I think this is harmful to her as well. This focus on the PPC and rejoining it is not going to solve anything or heal anyone. It will only deepen old wounds and inflict new ones.<br><br>However, I do have a complaint. In my opinion, the removing and re-application of the ban was too swift. There was no consensus with clear abstainees reached, the ban and removal were applied not even four, no, three hours after the original post of this sub-thread, and a link to this sub-thread was not, to my knowledge, posted in the Discord, which I feel would have been appropriate given that this involves both the Board and Discord. Even though I agree with the conclusions of this subthread, I do not like the way this occurred.</p>

            <p>-At no point has Zdimensia&#39;s ban been lifted. Zdimensia is still a banned user. In response to an email from someone who could not be determined to be Zdimensia at the time, a single IP address was unblocked as a technical measure.<br><br>-The Nameless Admin has a duty to ensure that banned users who continue to post to the Board are blocked on identification. Since there is a clear consensus that &#39;Mythcreant&#39; is Zdimensia, this was done. If tha consensus is overturned, the IP block will be removed once again, and an apology should be tendered to Mythcreant by the PPC Community.</p>

            <p>&gt;For the September ban... She agreed to a block that wasn&#39;t a ban and it was supposed to simply end. Did anyone tell her that it was changed to a ban and that there would be a vote? A lot of people were telling untruths during that post as well.<br><br>I was present for that vote. That is a gross misrepresentation. She agreed to a block with review in September, and the possibility to rejoin. That review went poorly for her, and she was banned permanently. Then she <i>impersonated other community members</i> in an attempt to return. IMHO, that&#39;s enough to warrent a permaban in and of itself. It&#39;s inexcusable. She subsequently pretended to be someone else in order to re-enter the community. After having been banned repeatedly.<br><br>Bram has shown a consistant disregard for the rules and standards of behavior of this community. Rules that are far from exclusive to us, and are present in almost every online community. Impersonation, continual ban evasion, and breaking rules despite being warned repeatedly are not infractions for which ignorance is an excuse.<br><br>Myth, I continue to be skeptical that you aren&#39;t Bram, and your continual alteration of your story (first claiming it was &quot;odd&quot; that you were banned, and (by my recollection, which may be wrong) claiming ignorance of anything to do with Bram) isn&#39;t helping your case. Ordinarily, I would be more willing to consider, but Bram has repeatedly shown herself able and willing to lie and engage in amoral behavior in attempts to return to this community. And Phobos&#39;s point about your mannerisms also stands: you are far too similar to Bram for me to believe you&#39;re anyone else.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t want to talk to other community members about this one because it would be completely unjustifiable on the off-chance that Mythcreant and zdimensia weren&#39;t the same person. How would we, as a community, apologize effectively for doing that? I decided to leave it to other people to figure out.<br><br>I think those people came to the right conclusions, but I also feel bad about just waiting for other people to solve the problem instead of being more proactive. I realize that this is obviously a special case, but in case it does come up again, does anyone have suggestions for how to report ban evasion attempts in the future?</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m not really a part of any Fan communities... What I&#39;ve heard of Steven Universe and what I&#39;ve briefly seen of Supernatural is a bit nutty.<br><br>I&#39;m a casual watcher.  I&#39;ve been watching House lately.  I watched some Doctor Who last fall but got kinda bored with Billy&#39;s arc.  10 and 11 were better.  I&#39;m kinda into Big Bang Theory.<br><br>I like Name of the Wind but last I heard the third book isn&#39;t out a decade after the second book was published.  Kvothe is kinda sueish, but that might be some embellishment because he&#39;s telling his own story.  The next time I pick up a book, it&#39;s probably going to be The Familiar Dragon trilogy.<br><br>I haven&#39;t watched all of them, but Gravity Falls, Steven Universe, and Star VS are cool.  I also watch My Little Pony but while the analysis vids are interesting, I&#39;m not in love with the show.</p>

I like how you use real!Sylendre&#39;s presence as a different, more emotional perspective on Azeroth&#39;s corruption, in comparison to Mei&#39;s more technical fan-based annoyance.  (I take it Sylendre is your actual gameplay name/avatar?)  I especially liked the quiet moment of dialogue between Sylendre and Erron, where he shares his view on being &quot;fictional.&quot;  It&#39;s a nice, calm moment in the middle of all the hectic madness elsewhere.<br><br>I feel <i>really</i> stupid for not figuring out the cause of the rain earlier than I did.  At the point when the journal first got wet, I even remember thinking that it was going to come back and affect the story in some way.  But you introduced the rain elements so subtly and slowly, I didn&#39;t make the connection until the same point when the agents did.  And you really put the sogginess to good use as a way to make things difficult for the agents.  I especially like that this gave Sylendre, the only one with the capability to solve that problem, to have a moment to shine and fix her home world mostly on her own.<br><br>All in all, I think you&#39;ve got a good grasp on constructing a mission in a funny, entertaining and demonstrative-of-canon way.  Well done!  I look forward to reading more.<br><br>—doctorlit, glad to have another quality spin-off under our roof</p>

            <p>Not receiving further notes is not indicative of anything. Your beta reader(s) may just be distracted (or procrastinating), but still intend to come back later. If they know their job, you should either receive a final email or get a clear &quot;go&quot; in a final comment on the Gdoc. In case they appear to have forgotten you, but you see them on the Board, it’s okay to ask what’s going on in an off-topic response (like &quot;OT: Are you still beta reading?&quot;). Asking by email is also okay, regardless of whether they are or aren’t active on the Board, but may not work if lost emails <i>are</i> the problem.<br><br>I generally default to email, and in your case I wanted to include some advice on further procedure that appeared to be too long for a note. In hindsight, doing both (the note just saying “email sent”) might have been the best.<br><br>I feel sorry for your losses, and I apologize for not asking what was going on. This wouldn’t have been the first time that something I beta-read was never posted, and I didn’t see you anywhere on the Board, so I wondered whether you had silently changed your mind and left (I’m glad you didn’t), and I didn’t want to pester you with further questions.  <br><br>HG</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Hello everyone!<br>Some of you might remember me from the Discord server from a few weeks ago. I know I was not around for a very long time and didn&#39;t get to talk with too many of you on a personal level, and for that I would like to apologize. However, I am not here to give a long-winded apology about whatever Discord crimes I may have committed, but rather to raise a few concerns about the state of the Discord chat after poking around on the board a bit. This is probably a few weeks late, but I have been busy with my personal life quite a bit lately. For those of you who don&#39;t know me, I will introduce myself as a man who has been writing for fun and self-improvement for about 14 years now, and came to the PPC&#39;s Discord chat hoping I could connect with other people who also enjoy writing and maybe even help some of those who might be stuck or need a little boost.<br>To be transparent, yes, I was banned from the Discord chat permanently, but we will be getting to that later on.<br><br>For starters, some of you may be thinking &quot;but I&#39;ve never seen you on the board!&quot; And you would be correct. To be a little bit blunt, I find the board is pretty archaic in its styling, and while you are all free to use it if it works for you I just didn&#39;t really want to go through the trouble, which I think is a perfectly fine way to go about things.<br><br>Anyway, my original intent here was to bring up a few concerns. I would like to say before I really begin that my intent here is not to get back into the chat, as my experience was pretty poor overall and even if my ban were lifted I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s the sort of place I want to be.<br><br>First and foremost, I joined the chat and almost immediately hopped into a debate on the topic of gun control in America because it is an issue I care a lot about. This would be fine, had it been a civilized conversation which I was lead to believe would be the case as according to the wiki the PPC &quot;prides itself on the ability to have mature discussions&quot;. My politics aside, I expect to go places and have people disagree with me. That&#39;s how people operate -- some think one thing, and others think another, and that is perfectly fine. It is also perfectly fine to have a mature discussion about these things, even when people are disagreeing. The problem is that I was consistently being dogpiled by at least 6 different people, bombarded with differing viewpoints and attacked numerous times with passive-aggressive comments during the whole hours-long discussion. Another new member (who was also banned, but he was being rather rude, so I can understand his ban) started to agree with me after the whole bit. The next day a comment was made calling him and people like him mentally unsound simply for believing a particular thing. You&#39;ll have to forgive me for not remembering names or quotes of each particular member as this was approximately four or five weeks ago now, I think, but one particular thing I remember being said during the conversation was &quot;Can we classify being a gun nut as a mental disorder?&quot; or something along those lines. This is certainly not &#39;mature discussion&#39; and it&#39;s definitely against the constitution that the admins of the chat said I was totally violating. It&#39;s very odd, considering I pointed out that there was a lot of passive-aggression going on in the channel, to which I was told by another member (I forget who, really, but I believe it was Maslab? That could definitely be wrong though) that it was &#39;better than open aggression&#39;. I said that it seemed like it still violated the constitution, and that statement was promptly ignored.<br><br>The next day, I believe, me and the other new guy were having a bit of a talk about various things, and one of the admins came into the #heavy_stuff channel, which was essentially the de facto politics room. They disagreed with us, we provided evidence back, and the other new member made a comment towards Maslab. One that was essentially saying &#39;the thing you just said is not very smart&#39;, and the admin instantly responded with the threat of possible suicide and police investigation to a small, insignificant snide comment. This is behavior I would not expect from a ten-year-old child, let alone the adult administrator of a chat room that describes itself as &#39;capable of mature discussion&#39;. Maslab then outright accused us both of being &#39;trolls&#39; only there to cause problems, which was very much not the case with myself (though for the other newbie I cannot say). We then switched the topic and asked another member about something they had said; we were outright told to change the subject by the same admin or be banned right then and there. So we changed the topic yet again.<br><br>The next day the channel was gone. Why? I assume because they did not want me to continue talking about politics. Call it paranoia, but there are only three persons with the ability to get rid of channels, and plenty of other people posted about politics elsewhere after that -- I just didn&#39;t want to start a discussion in another channel and risk being kicked or banned because it wasn&#39;t the place for it.<br><br>There was an incident in which another admin, Delta Juliette, said something I misinterpreted and so I said a slightly sarcastic retort back. This was instantly taken as an &quot;attack on her person&quot; (despite the fact that I did not attack them, personally, but instead the argument they were making), and was blown out of proportion. I apologized because I had misinterpreted, which I felt was the correct thing to do in the situation. They then continued to demand an apology from me for attacking them. I apologized if they mistook my words but it was not what I intended to say. They continued to demand I apologize for attacking them for another twenty or thirty minutes before they finally said that perhaps they had overreacted, with the caveat of &quot;but still&quot;. But still what?<br><br>The third incident I can think of is when a different user was thinking of writing their own badfic in order to write a mission about it. Myself and another user expressed that we didn&#39;t feel that&#39;s what writing missions was really about and gave our reasons why. I forget exactly who chimed in on this discussion, but the long and short of it is that at least three or four people that were not the person it concerned chimed in just to say &quot;she can do what she wants&quot; and other non-arguments in favor of the idea. When that person responded, they essentially said &quot;you are right but I will probably end up doing it anyway&quot;. I apologized to this person in DM after the fact if I had upset them, and we resolved the situation like adults.<br><br>I posted a silly picture that I thought was pretty funny a day before I was banned, and woke up to find my image missing. Discord doesn&#39;t really randomly delete images, so my only idea is that one of the moderators deleted it with no warning and no mention of it to me -- likely because it did not align with their political views.<br><br>The reason I was banned came after a discussion about whether or not &#39;multiplicity&#39; was valid or not, I believe, and I asked Delta Juliette what they, particularly, defined -phobia and prejudice. I was told by Maslab to &quot;go do some googling and educate yourself&quot;. Myself and several other people pointed out that I would not find their particular opinion on google. I waited for an answer, and Delta&#39;s answer was similarly unhelpful: &quot;Go read a book&quot;. I said that this was not helpful, and asked them to please explain their point of view. I was told it would be unfathomable to me if I had not read that particular book (a statement I still find rather dubious) and said &quot;please just explain your point of view, telling me to go read a book is not helpful&quot;. It is at this point I was banned, the only explanation given being &quot;I&#39;m doing this for my blood pressure&quot; by Maslab. I was never given an explanation, or a chance to appeal, as the admins either blocked me or don&#39;t accept messages from non-friends on discord.<br><br>This is all compounded by the fact that every time I tried to start a conversation or get somebody to talk to me about something that was not politics, I was ignored. I wanted to talk about writing, and so I asked -- I was ignored. I asked for recommendations for TV shows to watch -- I was ignored. I tried to talk about tabletop RPGs -- ignored. This only makes the chat seem more like a little clique than anything, unwilling to accept anyone who does not fit into a particular sociopolitical ideology.<br><br>All in all my experience with the PPC Discord chat has been extremely negative. Where I thought I would be able to communicate and connect with other writers, I found only a place where I was ridiculed, attacked, and in the end I believe outright banned for my own beliefs and what amounts, ultimately, to &#39;wrongthink&#39;. You cannot call yourself &quot;open and diverse&quot;, or &quot;able to have mature discussions&quot; if the mature discussions are just everybody agreeing with each other, and then say anybody who doesn&#39;t agree with you is just a &#39;troll&#39;. I also expected to see a lot of discussion about writing or fanfiction in general. Instead writing came up maybe two or three times in two weeks, which is very odd for a community centered on the idea of writing things. And I totally understand -- talking about writing all the time would be boring. But most of the discussion in the server is actually a big echo chamber for sociopolitics, and very little talk about writing actually goes on. Most of the &#39;discussion&#39; about writing was just blithe roleplaying the #rudis channel, which wasn&#39;t even really that active.<br>I really cannot emphasize enough how disappointed I am. Where I thought I would find a fun community of writers who I could talk with, help, get help from, share cool things and make fun of badfic, I instead found an echo chamber run primarily by three people who accuse anyone who does not agree with their views as a &#39;troll&#39;, and where other members blatantly ignore the rules set in place and attack persons passive-aggressively, and sometimes even blatantly. The overall nature of the chat feels very oppressive as opposed to the &#39;free, open, and diverse&#39; atmosphere I was lead to believe it would have. In the end I feel I was banned for no good reason at all, and was never given an explanation. My images were deleted by moderators without warning or mention. I was accused of being a terrible person for misinterpreting a comment and apologizing immediately after realizing I had misinterpreted. After looking around some I can see the board has a very different atmosphere, which is good, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be posting here anyway. I will probably also be telling other friends of mine who also write that the Discord chat, at least, is a poor place to find a fun writing community focused on self-improvement. I feel that the bottom line here is that the discord chat is barely even a writing community anymore and more of a political one focused on socialist ideology. This is not derisive towards these people in the slightest, but that is ultimately what I found myself reading and seeing almost every day.<br>The intent here is not to start a political discussion, but to tell some of the members on the board who perhaps do not visit the discord chat what it is like, and to warn against ever visiting it. My opinion of it is about as low as it can go at this point. Perhaps this will spur on a change in the community, and cause a review of what is and isn&#39;t acceptable. Perhaps the people who banned me will say &quot;no no, he was definitely a troll,&quot; which I suspect will happen, but I assure you this cannot be further from the truth. Perhaps nothing will happen I dunno All I can say is you can be certain that I will make sure friends know that the PPC Discord chat is not a very good one for people interested in writing as a hobby or a profession.<br><br>Thanks, Grimalkinii</p>

            <p>I think this is the post I will try to answer the majority of questions on since I am still having a lot of trouble navigating the board itself, being unfamiliar with yourwebapps myself.<br><br>1. To address the cries of &quot;it sends up red flags that he didn&#39;t post on the board&quot;: I did mention this in my original post that my main reason for not wanting to was that I find the structure of it archaic and hard to navigate and use. It&#39;s also relatively difficult to have a conversation over it in my opinion, and I would rather have live dialogue with people. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a crime. I am still honestly having trouble navigating. Should I perhaps hav made a post on the board before getting too into the discord? Maybe, but honestly it just seemed like an unnecessary pleasantry that probably would not have changed people&#39;s opinions of me too much anyway. Maybe that&#39;s wrong, but even so.<br><br>2. To address Delta&#39;s issue of my pronoun usage in my original post: It&#39;s just how I speak and there is no offense meant towards you. I advise against looking for hidden slights in everything a person might say.<br><br>3. To address the &quot;He was actually told to stop the discussion: The problem I have is that the discussion I intended to have on &quot;What does Delta define prejudice as&quot; was taken to a different channel and was intended to be a separate discussion than the one I was instructed to stop having, which if I recall correctly was the one on multiplicity (again, it&#39;s been a few weeks, so forgive me if I&#39;m misremembering) which I did stop having once i was instructed to stop having it.<br>Its intent was to sort of understand Delta&#39;s frame of mind a little better, since I was having trouble doing so in the first place, I think. Now, had Delta said &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about this&quot;, that would have been the end of it for me. The issue is that this was never said. What was said were essentially &quot;Go read this book before I talk to you,&quot; which is not saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about this&quot;. It is something I took both as a personal slight -- it is insulting, to me, to insinuate that I could not understand where a person is coming from simply because I have not read a single piece of literature. Regardless, had the words spoken been &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about this&quot;, it would have been over right then and there.<br>For the record, the gun control meme being deleted discussion was actually not something I was a huge part of, if I recall correctly, and while I was fairly confused as to why it was deleted without warning or mention I decided it would probably be best to drop the whole thing.<br><br>4. My big issue with the reasoning for the kick that I am only finding out about now is that it makes no sense to me. Not from an &quot;I didn&#39;t do this&quot; standpoint, but from a logical and moral one. If asking somebody to explain their viewpoint and getting frustrated when they give non-answers that come off as offensive to me is an act of &#39;violence&#39; simply because it might possibly maybe cause someone at some point to poke fun at that person, then why should anybody ever open up to another person? If asking somebody who is a minority to explain their reasoning or their thought process is an act of &#39;violence&#39;, this sets a VERY scary precedent. Am I supposed to take everything everyone says only at face value and never try to figure anything out simply because they are not part of the majority? If this is true, then I suppose I am an abusive boyfriend because I ask my girlfriend -- who happens to be a transgender person -- to open up to me so that I may help her when she feels upset and is not always so forthcoming with these things due to past trauma. I cannot express how frightening the concept of &#39;asking somebody to explain their point of view is an act of violence&#39; is to me. Badgering is annoying, certainly, but as in my point above I would have dropped it immediately had I actually been asked to quit asking Delta these things -- which did not happen.<br>In short, &#39;you committed violence against another member by asking them a question and getting frustrated that you weren&#39;t getting an answer&#39; is NOT a reason for a kick and very much less so for a ban. That makes absolutely no sense to me from any frame of reference. Had I flipped out and started slinging insults at Delta? Sure. Had I started swearing up a storm and throwing a big hissy-fit? Sure. But geting a little bit frustrated and saying &quot;Hey, telling me to go read a book is not helpful, can you please answer my question&quot; is neither of these things -- and as I said, a simple &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it&quot; would have very easily been the end of it.<br><br>5. For accusations of &quot;they were working together to troll&quot;: I honestly don&#39;t think the fact that we agreed on some things is reason enough to believe we were in cahoots, and my joining came after finding out about the place from some trawling of fanfiction sites. Admittedly I will say it definitely looks suspicious -- we joined on the same day hours apart, and had a few similar opinions on political issues -- and ultimately I do see why it would be suspicious to the admins. However, I do not believe this is clear and decisive evidence that we were working in tandem in any way. Using the same logic, I could say that the admins were conspiring against me to ban me simply because the two who were largely active during my time in the Discord chat agreed on many topics and were both admins. Of course, I don&#39;t believe that, but it seems just as ridiculous to me.<br><br>6. Lastly, on the topic of sealioning: Admittedly, I do ask a lot of questions. However, this is generally to gain a better understanding of a person and their position on something, or to clarify something that may have been unclear.<br><br>Also, I would like to apologize: I do remember now that the &#39;demanding an apology for twenty minutes&#39; thing was not Delta but somebody else. My mistake and apologies to Delta for the mistake.</p>

            <p>First, I appreciate you calmly and rationally explaining your side of the story. I choose to believe you&#39;re telling the truth, and I sympathize.<br><br>But I&#39;d sympathize more if you hadn&#39;t said this:<br><br>&quot;simply because it might possibly maybe cause someone at some point to poke fun at that person&quot;<br><br>I happen to agree with a lot of what you said in point 4, but that right there is far too flippant. To understand the reasoning, try putting yourself in the shoes of someone who&#39;s been shamed and possibly abused for their feelings and/or identity their whole life, and imagine what they must expect to happen any time they dare to be open about them.

The stakes, even if you don&#39;t believe they&#39;re the same as violence, are still loads higher than just &quot;poking fun.&quot; That&#39;s a completely unfair minimization of other people&#39;s experience.

            <p>Honestly, I will admit that you tend to badger people. OTOH, that&#39;s not a crime. And the issue of whether or not it was made clear to you that you should stop was one I raised with the mods. At the time, I eventually sided with them, but... I&#39;m having second thoughts. I dunno. I will continue to reserve judgement on whether you should be unbanned or anything, because I genuinely am not sure, but there are some things I wanted to say.<br><br>Namely this:<br><br>Grimal, do I think that some of your actions were inappropriate or wrong? Yes. Absolutely. I&#39;m not sure they warranted a ban (as I said, I&#39;m abstaining from that), but I don&#39;t believe you were perfect.<br><br>Do I feel that the mods would have been more forgiving of your, deliberately or no (I genuinely think the mods are trying to do their best, and I do applaud them, despite what I&#39;m about to say), if you were more politically aligned with them? Yes. Absolutely.<br><br>I believe it was Nova who said that if Grimal should be banned, he isn&#39;t the only one. I concur. There are others who have committed acts I feel are similar. (with the caveat that I never read #heavy_stuff. So I cannot speak for what went on there, only the act that, allegedly, actually got Grimal banned).<br><br>It was some time ago, long enough that I&#39;m not willing to submit it as any more then an anecdote, as I fear my emotions may have amplified it, but on the first night in the Discord, another member gave me what felt very much like a third degree over a philosophical disagreement. Had it not been for some private discussions with several other members, there is a possibility that I would have left, for fear that I would be unwelcome for my opinions. Thankfully, this turned out not to be the case. Again, it felt like a third degree, but it may not have been that extreme, I was a skittish newbie at the time and this was more than half a year ago at this point. Don&#39;t take this as evidence of wrongdoing, more as an indication that some of the more strongly political characters on the discord are more than capable of scaring people off.<br><br>In any case, from my perspective, the mods have been less willing to go after both longstanding community members and those who agree with them for violation of community standards. I don&#39;t think this is deliberate: I think it&#39;s just simple bias of the sort that is present in every human being on earth. But it is not helped by the fact that moderator power is centralized in very few hands: PoorCynic is rarely online, so most of the time, our moderators consist of two occupants of a single house in a single city, who tend to agree with one another a lot.<br><br>In effect, we do not have a council, as the board does. We have a pair of benevolent dictators. Dictators who are trying very hard to get it right, but dictators all the same. And not necessarily ones who always represent the will of the community as a whole (although it is hard to say for sure): I know for a fact that I was not the only one who questioned Grimal&#39;s ban.<br><br>Before we go any further, I would once again like to emphasize that I don&#39;t hate the mods. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re evil. In fact, again, I feel they are doing a largely admirable job. But they&#39;re just two people often of one mind. That&#39;s not their fault, but I feel it can create problems, contrasting with the larger pool of administrators we have on the board—especially in light of the fact that any regular member will be afraid to challenge someone who can get them banned, even if they think that person is wrong about something.<br><br>Finally, I do want to address one thing here that I <i>definitely</i> think was wrong. Perhaps the only thing that I can entirely say was so. That thing is that Grimal was not really given a reason for his ban. That is absolutely a problem. Everyone at least deserves to at least know why they were banned, and I suggest we adopt a policy about this in the future. Regardless of whether or not it was just, his ban felt abrupt, unfair, and arbitrary, even from the perspective of other members. Had I not had an <i>extensive</i> conversation with a mod afterwards, I would still summarize their reasoning—even AFTER the explanation Grimal didn&#39;t get—as &quot;they were tired and he was annoying.&quot;<br><br>So better explanation of mod actions, both to the people they are acting on and to the rest of the members, need to be a thing, so that we can understand an action is just, and also because (and this part may not be necessary at present—I still believe that are mods are generally pretty good mods) it leads to better moderation: having to write a statement of reasoning forces you to think harder about a ban, and if you can&#39;t write one, the ban may not, in fact, be just.</p>

            <p>Hello. I&#39;m not really around the Board anymore for various reasons that I won&#39;t get into here, but I am still on the Discord. I have to be, because I&#39;m the channel administration, And as the channel administrator, I&#39;m the one who makes the final decision on bans and the like (upon taking proper consultation from my moderators, of course). So if anyone should be taken to task for bans, let it be me.<br><br>Now, regarding the incident being discussed here. First off, I removed the Heavy Stuff channel because of both user complaints and concerns from the mods. After looking at the channel itself, I agreed that it should be removed and did so. As for the trolling, Delta and Maslab showed me logs pertaining to the behavior of the two individuals in question. I found the details presented to me sufficient enough evidence to warrant bans. In regards to Grimalkinii himself, I (and the mods) came to the conclusion that he was not presenting himself in good faith, and was instead acting as a sort of supporter for Pentagon.<br><br>I trust the judgments of the mods. They have demonstrated to me on multiple occasions that they are more than capable of doing their jobs without great bias. Yes, they&#39;re not perfect, but no one is. <br><br>And their jobs? Personally, I&#39;m in agreement with Nesh&#39;s description. A good mod should make the Discord a safe and engaging place. They must fairly enforce the rules. They also have to address issues like trolls or overt hostility in a timely and effective manner. These are not easy tasks. We are but mortals. And the Constitution only works when people are going to act in good faith.<br><br>I am more than willing to take suggestions regarding the Discord into account. I liked the idea of creating a specific chat channel dedicated entirely to writing, so that&#39;s been done. I am also open to the idea of additional mods. It&#39;s tough for three people to monitor a 24-hour chatroom. I&#39;m not sold on the idea of splitting the channel, but I&#39;m open to receiving arguments on the subject.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>My main problem in this matter was when Maslab kicked Grimalkinii because it was &#39;bad for his blood pressure&#39;. Obviously I don&#39;t know the entire decision making process, but was that kick discussed, and was going to happen anyway, just with a really bad reasoning behind it when it was done, or was it an act done just by Maslab? Because if it&#39;s the former I&#39;d understand, but if it was the latter than I would say that that does not constitute (in my books) &#39;fairly enforcing the rules&#39;. I haven&#39;t had a problem with Maslab at any other point, but that one is just making me question whether I personally would be happy to be in a server with him as a mod without constraint. I&#39;m sorry if that sounds a little harsh, but it&#39;s true. <br><br>Novastorme</p>

            <p>I have given the mods leeway when it come to issuing kicks. They may do so on their own prerogative. Otherwise, they would have to summon me for every incident. That would not be efficient, especially when dealing with a spam troll or similar.<br><br>Regarding Maslab&#39;s kick of Grimalkinii: while it is true that the initial response was a flippant one, the ultimate reasoning was sound. If I might quote from the logs:<br><br><i>Demanding that a minority explain why a particular thing is transphobic &quot;from their point of view&quot; and not accepting otherwise is an act of violence as it essentially is demanding they open themselves up unnecessarily and can provide an even larger target for abuse.<br><br>It is absolutely unreasonable for them to demand that and not accept a &quot;I do not want to do so&quot;.<br><br>I would hope everyone here can realize that &quot;no&quot; is an appropriate response to any question.</i><br><br>Grimalkinii was badgering the mods in such a way that was aggressive and insensitive. His line of questions were interpreted as being in bad faith, with no intent other than to cause annoyance. I saw no issue with the kick when I was informed of it later. In any event, I have informed the mods to immediately post their reasoning for any kick in the future.</p>

            <p>The reasoning may have been sound, but the question I have, because the answer is not apparent from the logs that remain, is whether or not Grimalkinii was given a fair chance to understand what he was doing wrong and stop it before he was kicked. I think the only clear signal to stop was Delta&#39;s &quot;Nah. I&#39;m done, mx. sealion,&quot; which appears to have come <i>after</i> Maslab kicked him. Yes, Maslab gave an explanation, but did anyone besides Maslab understand it beforehand? It&#39;s clear from the logs that several people did not. It&#39;s not clear how much Grimalkinii did or did not understand.<br><br>I do see how his questions can be read as willfully ignorant badgering, but I can equally see a reading of plain frustration. In the absence of a transcript, I&#39;d like some more explanation for what makes you certain it was the former and not the latter.<br><br>And, just to clarify, when you say the mods have been informed to immediately post their reasoning for any kick, does that mean before, or after the kick?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>He (and others involved) were asked to stop. As can be seen in the log, both Maxewell and Tomash asked that the conversation be halted. It was Grimalkinii who reignited the debate with his question about being prejudiced. All that takes place on the same day. Within the same hour, even. Yes, it could have been made more clear why the kick ensued, but the reasoning was understood upon clarification.<br><br>As for whether or not it was intentional, that admittedly comes down to interpretation. Maslab and Delta (and I, because I agree with their summation) believed that Grimalkinii&#39;s position could not be taken in good faith, due to the proximity of his joining the PPC with Pentagon and his leaping in/agreeing with the later&#39;s opinions and arguments. That&#39;s what the &#39;sealion&#39; is referring to. It&#39;s in reference to a tactic known as &#39;sealioning&#39;, wherein a person asks constant questions in an attempt to wear down their opponent rather than to get information.<br><br>Regarding your final question, I did not specify either before or after at the time. I have since clarified my directions as to post their reasoning prior to the kick.</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t realized the gun control meme discussion (very clearly instructed to drop) and the &quot;what is prejudice&quot; discussion were that closely linked.

            <p>Having thought about this overnight, here&#39;s what I see as the main concern that needs to be addressed:<br><br>Are the mods doing their job to make the Discord a good, comfortable place for all* members?<br><br>This is not the first time I&#39;ve heard concerns that, in the Discord, saying the wrong thing to the wrong person at the wrong time can get you ostracized, shamed, ridiculed, insulted, or otherwise punished, with no way of knowing what to avoid ahead of time. I can think of several members in good standing off the top of my head with such concerns, actually, some of them for quite a long time. This is especially bad if &quot;the wrong person&quot; is a mod with the power to kick or ban anyone they don&#39;t feel like dealing with that day.<br><br>So, what I propose is to take this opportunity for a sort of performance review of the current mods and state of the Discord. I could set up a brief Google survey with a few fairly standard questions: do you enjoy being in the Discord, are the mods doing their jobs, if not why not, what would you improve, etc. I think I would require a username to help filter out any opportunistic trolls, but I&#39;m pretty sure the results could be kept private, and I&#39;d present the data free from any identifiers.<br><br>First, though, an important question: What <i>is</i> the job of the mods? We&#39;ll have to agree on that before we can usefully discuss whether they&#39;re doing it or not.<br><br>I believe the job of a mod is to ensure that the Discord is a safe, fun environment for all* members. They have a duty to first ensure that everyone knows the rules, then to ensure that the rules are fairly and consistently enforced, always assuming good faith when possible. I believe this requires a certain level of detachment, so that one&#39;s personal biases and moods are managed such that people you disagree with* are not treated differently from people you do agree with.<br><br>What do the rest of you think? Is a review a good idea? Is a survey a good idea? Is that definition useful? Let me know.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>* Those in neither flagrant nor repetitious violation of the Constitution.</p>

            <p>First of all, I support this survey, especially since complaints like the ones you mentioned came up. That&#39;s not good, and we really should address that type of behavior.<br><br>Now, here&#39;s some things I think that anyone on the Discord should be (and generally is) doing:<br>- If people are breaking the Constitution (or, in the more common case, the Discord-specific adenda like rot13-ing NSFW stuff), others should ask them to please stop, edit their massage, or whatever else is needed to fix this.<br>- If people are leaning on you as described above, you should generally do what&#39;s being asked (assuming that the people doing the leaning have a point, since this isn&#39;t always the case).<br>- As a specialization, if discussion is getting to the point where people want it dropped, taken to PMs, or moved to the Board, the participants should go along with that.<br><br>The community in general should recognize that moderating a real-time chat will involve making judgment calls. This doesn&#39;t mean there can&#39;t be appeals or discussions (see, for example, this thread), just that we shouldn&#39;t go after moderators for moderating unless it&#39;s clearly becoming abuse of power.<br><br>The moderators&#39; jobs, from my perspective, include the following:<br>- The moderators should keep the chat safe (and having handled that, fun) for all* (using Nesh&#39;s footnote) participants.<br>  - As a subpoint, if someone&#39;s having a safety or harassment concern, I&#39;d say it&#39;s fine for the moderators to bring it up/tell someone to knock their behavior off instead of the victim.<br>- The moderators should take action to enforce the rules if the usual community-based mechanisms aren&#39;t working (and it&#39;s preferred if the moderators just lean on people like everyone else instead of putting their mod hats if possible).<br>  - It&#39;s unclear what form this enforcement should take. Kicks are an option (with the expectation that you can come right back, because it&#39;s just a very stern &quot;knock it off&quot;.)<br>- If there seem to be trolls or people acting in bad faith on the Discord, moderators should remove them.<br>- Moderators should be transparent about what they&#39;re doing and remain consistent and fair (up to the fact that they&#39;re human and all).<br><br>I&#39;d also put in a vote for adding another mod, especially someone who isn&#39;t on Pacific time.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>And a suggestion- there are currently three mods total, only two of whom are regular visibly active. We could use more- at the moment, it feels like I&#39;m always on call and only rarely have backup. This is not a good way to mod- as we&#39;re discussing the role of mods, we should also talk about how many there should be.</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t really there for much of the politics discussion but I WAS there for the write-your-own badfic. I&#39;ve looked over the logs and I&#39;m not sure what to think. I don&#39;t know how much of what Grimalkinii is saying is true, but I did think at the time that the banning of them was a little sketchy. Since I personally implicitly trust Maslab, though, I decided to leave well enough alone. Anyways, I think that maybe it might have been a bit hasty to just ban Grim like that, and I think, if they wanted one, they should totally have a second chance, if only to see how they behave without Pentagon around. *shrug* It&#39;s up to y&#39;all, though. That&#39;s just my two cents. <br><br></p>

            <p>Neither you nor Pentagon attempted to engage with the PPC outside of the Discord. I just did a search for your username and you didn&#39;t post a newbie thread here, which seems really odd considering you want to have such a massive effect on PPC culture.<br><br>Regardless of your views on the matter, the Board is the primary means of engagement with the PPC community as a whole.

            <p>From what I know, yes, a bit of a red flag. From what I have understood when I first joined, and how it has been explained to me, it is not only customary, but, as the wiki states, &quot;Just make a post introducing yourself on the PPC Posting Board and receive the warm welcome of your fellows, and boom, you&#39;ve officially joined the PPC.&quot; I certainly see people as part of the PPC if they&#39;re active on the Discord, and engaging with the community in a non-problematic way. With the most recent zdimensia and Bramadin issue, after the ban on Bramadin, I was wary of newbies, as a whole. Because, I was under the impression that they might be an alternate account. Lo and behold, recently, that was right. But this general red flag also appeared for both Pentagon and Grimal. To be entirely honest: I believed both of them got fair warnings about the politics in the chat, and to keep the debating and arguing to a minimum. I was a little concerned that these two members, who joined at relatively the same time, might be trolls trying to start up drama. Neither of them introduced themselves on the board, either, which I took to mean that they were not going to stick around for long, if at all, because neither of them put anything permanent down for all to see. Those were my fears and concerns, and that&#39;s why I got red flags. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s looking to me like we need an on-Board discussion about this so we can get a sense of the consensus (or lack of consensus) about how the chat would like to handle the whole politics thing.<br><br>On the one hand, many folks want to talk about politics in the chat. It&#39;s an important topic that&#39;s often relevant to Boarders (and even more so in the case of some Boarders in marginalized groups - we&#39;ve got at least a few trans folks around here). We&#39;re also a community that prides itself on the ability to have mature, civil discussions about this stuff, and we very often succeed in doing so.<br><br>On the other hand, as Delta put it a few days ago, &quot;[T]his is not a space that focuses on politics.&quot; Furtheremore, there&#39;s other folks who&#39;ve expressed their desire to not have certain heavy political topics (like mass shootings) pop up when they open up the chat, and there have been a few cases where some person has been asked to tone it down with the political posts because it was getting a bit much.<br><br>The &quot;I don&#39;t want all this mass shooting stuff&quot; is the main reason why #heavy<em>stuff (which just about immediately became #politics) was created. Unfortunately, &quot;let&#39;s cordon off the politics into its own channel, so people can mute it if they don&#39;t want to see it&quot; didn&#39;t seem to work. My theory is that an effect of making the channel was to encourage way more political discussion than previously, now that there was a place to put it, which wasn&#39;t something we wanted as a server. (This is, incidentally, why I&#39;m supporting some form of #writing - we want to promote discussion of it.)<br><br>What seems to be the case is that there&#39;s such a thing as &quot;too much politics [right now]&quot; for most people in chat (which is person- and topic-dependent). It&#39;s rather unclear where the line is, other than &quot;the point at which folks start asking you to tone it down&quot;. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure how to articulate the standard here (or if there even is a way to do that), and so I&#39;d like people to please chime in on this.<br><br>I do, however, want to repropose a suggestion that I remember someone making (even though I can&#39;t find it) from after the #heavy</em>stuff debacle: links that&#39;re very likely to tank someone&#39;s mood (the main example being heavy politics - shootings, police brutality, etc., but probably also suicides and similar) should be rot13&#39;d. The reasoning here is similar to spoilers - let&#39;s not expose people who don&#39;t want to see this to such things by default.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>To start off, I&#39;d like to make some distinctions. I&#39;ll define &quot;light politics&quot; to be things like &quot;[Country] is debating a net neutrality bill.&quot;, &quot;[Country] just [legalized/banned] [gay marriage/weed/...]&quot;, &quot;There&#39;s an election on/Here&#39;s some results.&quot; and so on. It probably also includes things like discussing political ideology and who you&#39;re thinking of voting for, so long as it&#39;s not straying too far into heavy stuff.<br><br>Another type of content under discussion is what I&#39;ll call &quot;heavy stuff&quot;, which is usually also political in nature. Heavy stuff encompasses things like shootings, bombings, police brutality, and so on, and probably the follow-on discussion.<br><br>From what I can tell in both this thread and elsewhere, light politics isn&#39;t something we appear to be objecting to. It seems to fall into about the same category as &quot;[Media company] just [announced/cancelled] [thing].&quot;. Therefore, I don&#39;t think we should really do anything about them, other than clarifying that if you have someone asking for a conversation/posting (especially about this sort of stuff) to stop or be moved elsewhere, that needs to happen. <br><br>In contrast, heavy stuff is a more divisive topic. Some people want to talk about it. Others plain don&#39;t want to see it. So, how do we resolve this? I&#39;d like to point to an analogous situation - NSFW (or near-NSFW) badfic quotes. Some people want to see them, others (like Silenthunder) don&#39;t. The solution we hit on there is to rot13 that sort of thing so people trying to avoid it can do so.<br><br>I again propose the same solution. Heavy stuff (which someone needs to try and define more concretely, please) should be posted under rot13 with a warning, and, for lack of a better term, &quot;heavy&quot; discussion about it (discussion that&#39;s still referring a lot to the heavy thing in a concrete way) should also stay under rot13.<br><br>I again oppose labeling a chunk of the Discord &quot;politics&quot; or &quot;politics OK&quot; because we tried that and it blew up in our face. If anyone has reasons they think it&#39;ll be different this time, I&#39;d be more than happy to hear them.<br><br>tl;dr: rot13 for tragedies and other heavy stuff, and back off on politics when people ask you to<br><br>- Tomash</p>

Political identities are nearly synonymous with moral values. That&#39;s due to the extremely polarized state of the world we live in today. It wasn&#39;t like this, at least not to such an intense degree, ten or fifteen years ago, when the Board was new.<br><br>That&#39;s why I wonder if leaving all that stuff to communities intended for it might be best at this time. We&#39;re <i>not</i> a political forum; we are a writing and community forum. It used to be possible to have rational discussions about different political viewpoints here, but that was before the issues were so radicalized.<br><br>But then again, we do have a very clear ideological statement in our Constitution that happens to align with a political identity. Maybe we are political whether we like it or not, and to pretend otherwise and make this a place where we stick our heads in the sand would be an insult to us all.<br><br>I think Grundleplith is dead-on with <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314774;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this post</a>, where they say &quot;The main issue really is that stifling discussion will make some people angry, whereas a lack of filtering will hurt others.&quot;<br><br>Because, yeah: we&#39;re all in different places in our personal growth and development, and we don&#39;t all share the same passions/fears/concerns to the same degree. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but it does make this stuff difficult to navigate. I&#39;m not sure what the solution is, or if there can really be one.<br><br>One thing we can do is constantly remind ourselves to be compassionate and understanding with each other (and ourselves!), even—<i>especially</i>—when it&#39;s hard. We can try to live the values of the ideal world we want.<br><br>That&#39;s not an answer or a solution, but it might be a way toward one.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><b>On political discussion in the PPC:</b><br><br>Like you said, this is tricky to navigate. I&#39;m also not sure there&#39;s a good answer to &quot;what should the state of political discussion in the PPC be?&quot;. However, I believe that we can generally keep things from spiraling out of control and that we don&#39;t need (and, per Plith, shouldn&#39;t) ban political topics entirely.<br><br>In other words, I&#39;m not seeing &quot;politics&quot; as a problem that needs immediate solving, since we&#39;re doing a fairly good job of keeping a handle on it. The one thing I&#39;m concerned about is the conflicting access needs around tragedies etc. that prompted the creation of #heavy<em>stuff, which is why I&#39;m proposing an expansion of what you&#39;re expected to rot13 in chat to include that sort of thing. <br><br>Again, I think we can do (and generally are doing) a good job of self-regulating on this.<br><br><b>On our political lean:</b><br><br>Let&#39;s admit it: there are views (which are, at this time, a matter of politics) that will get you banned if you insist on holding/acting on them openly. For example, if someone kept intentionally (after being told to knock it off) using he/him pronouns for Delta after finding out she happened to be trans, they&#39;d be out the door real fast because that violates Article 2 and we just won&#39;t have it here. There&#39;s a noticable number of people out there who think that operating this way is wrong (and a somewhat small subset of them who would say it&#39;s causing the end of civilization as we know it). <br><br>In addition, if we look at <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=313678">the political compass thread from January</a>, we aren&#39;t a political monolith or massively intolerant, but we do seem to have something of a lean, especially towards being progressive on social issues. This could be a case of self-selection, given things like Article 2 in the constitution. <br><br>That being said, we have managed (and I&#39;m not so pessimistic as to think we won&#39;t be able to do it in the future) to support a community of people with noticeably different views on, say, gun control without turning into an uncontrolled flamefest (#heavy</em>stuff partially excepted, since there were people in there trying to calm things down although it didn&#39;t work).<br><br>So, we could say the PPC is a rather tolerant place, but there are limits to that, which I&#39;d like to think we&#39;ve done a good job of articulating.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>One for the lighter political stuff in the main chatting category that people would be happy with, and another for the heavier stuff in either it&#39;s own category or in a category with other, generally heavier stuff that could be ignored/blocked out by those that don&#39;t want to see it. <br><br>Also I vote for a writing stuff channel, but this might as well be just a formality considering the fact that I did suggest it. </p>

            <p>As for politics... I think a solution might be similar to what we might do with the Categories. If we could, perhaps, separate some channels off as ones where discussions about politics could be tolerated, without making a #politics. The idea behind this being that it would allow people who didn&#39;t want to get into politics to mute certain areas and avoid that kind of thing, but it wouldn&#39;t be the kind of please-talk-about-politics-here thing that #heavy_stuff was. And, I think, some sort of stop button or threshold. Like, calling a vote or something and over a certain threshold stopping the discussion and moving on to something else.</p>

            <p>One thing I&#39;ve been learning over the past couple of years is that everything can be political in nature. Politics affects all of us, and it affects some of us more directly than others. Trying to ban all politics risks ignoring a crucial part of (at least some) people&#39;s lives, and I don&#39;t want to be part of a community that refuses to care about its members in that way.<br><br>Besides, the PPC is supposed to be a bit broader than just laughing at bad fan fiction. Ideally, we&#39;d help each other write good stories with complex characters and worlds. Nobody&#39;s tried to talk about politics as it relates to writing fiction to my knowledge, but we don&#39;t want to discourage people from asking questions about writing. We should be doing the opposite.</p>

            <p>With regards to the current purpose of the PPC Discord Chat, Grimalkinii is right, it is *not* a place for anyone to come in and talk about original fiction to say it is is a massive mistake. What it is is a place for real time conversations about various things, both serious and inane, although the serious ones tend to end... badly. For a newbie coming in who just wants to talk writing, especially writing that doesn&#39;t involve the PPC Universe it is simply not suitable and as Grimalkinii says and I (for the most part) agree &quot; I feel that the bottom line here is that the discord chat is barely even a writing community anymore and more of a political one focused on socialist ideology.&quot; But then, should it be? While the PPC Community as a whole promotes good writing, nowhere that I can see does it say that the Discord is a place to go for talking about writing. Should it be? Would a Writing Stuff channel be a good idea for those who want that sort of thing? Maybe. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just a suggestion that I think should at least be discussed. And it would put the writing back in writing community for the chat. <br><br>As to the rest of the post and the rest on the conversation at the moment, from the logs that are currently available I can see where people are coming from with regards to saying that Grimalkinii broke the Constitution, specifically Section One, Rule 4. But you never see any warning about strikes, you never see anyone telling Grimalkinii to check the Constitution as to why what they were doing could be seen as wrong. At the same time, I think that you could just as easily get Maslab under Section One, Rule One for not respecting Grimalkinii and kicking him &#39;because of his (Maslab&#39;s) blood pressure&#39; and not respecting Grimalkinii and their views. In my opinion I would then question what should be done with Maslab&#39;s status as a mod. I think it also highlights the fact that the Constitution is, to me, not followed anywhere near as much as it should be on the Discord chat. <br><br>When it comes down to &#39;write your own badfic&#39; for all of those pointing at the Constitution in this conversation while saying it&#39;s OK to write your own badfics, I&#39;d suggest you read Section 7, more specifically Rule 25. But then again, that&#39;s just me. <br><br>Overall this complaint has made me realise several things. 1) I know I lurk in the Discord a lot of the time, but I should speak up more, especially when things are not right. 2) The Discord is flawed. Simple. Should it be removed? No. Should it still be called the PPC Discord chat? eh, I&#39;m out on that one. My current idea is that we should split it into two, one for writing things, including RP like Rudi&#39;s and one for the chatting/community, that&#39;d solve a lot of the problems I think. Name one the PPC Discord and the other The Chat Lounge (or something like that). 3) If Grimalkinii deserved to be kicked and banned from the Discord there are others who should also be kicked for breaking the Constitution (and I&#39;m not just talking about Maslab, there are others too) 4) We need more permanent logs for Discord, even if it&#39;s just screenshots of posts before they&#39;re deleted/asked to be edited, we need to see them. 5) Maybe Des was right after all.<br><br>Novastorme.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m opposed to having two servers. The writing and community aspects of the PPC are rather intertwined, and I&#39;d prefer to keep them together.<br><br>However, adding a #writing or similar would be a good idea, just to make it clear there&#39;s a place to discuss that sort of thing. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in danger of having too many channels at the moment (too many channels can lead to channel-selection paralysis).<br><br>In addition, Discord recently added a &quot;categories&quot; system that lets you group channels.

            <p>It&#39;s not like we don&#39;t talk about writing on the Discord. We&#39;ve definitely had &quot;could I get some advice on X in the thing I&#39;m writing&quot; discussions at times (we don&#39;t have too much of on the Board either), along with stuff like RP and &quot;hey here&#39;s a badfic&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;ll add a vote for a &quot;here&#39;s some info about how our server works (and a link to the Board/Constitution)&quot; channel for newbies to land in. That info&#39;s currently sitting on the wiki, which isn&#39;t too discoverable.<br><br>I&#39;m still considering whether some Discord channels need splitting (other than the addition of #writing). (#recs<em>and</em>plugs does double duty as the actual &quot;recs and plugs&quot; channel and the overflow badfic talk channel, for example). There seems to be a general principle, that, up to a point, having a channel about X in a server encourages people to talk about X. (I suspect this was a good chunk of the problem with #heavy_stuff, which I&#39;ll try and elaborate on elsewhere.)<br><br>Now, do we want to keep uneditable logs just in case this sort of incident comes up (where an entire channel got deleted)... I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m not quite convinced that &quot;people editing their way out of trouble&quot; or &quot;evidence getting deleted&quot; (and the like) are common enough occurrences to make that sort of thing worth it.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>One, the Heavy_Stuff channel was removed for a very simple reason: in the week or so it was up, it had caused at least three major arguments and large amounts of drama. It was removed because the place for people to vent about the bad things happening had become a bad place for anyone not looking for an argument. <br><br>Two, the topic change mentioned was a very serious affair regarding a member. For the sake of privacy, I won’t give details, but I will say that they were shut down again because they were demanding an explanation from someone who was very clearly uncomfortable and did not want to give it. It was not as if they were shut down because it was them. <br><br>As for the final banning, it was the same sort of situation, with Delta clearly unhappy with what was being asked, and the demands for answers not stopping. Given the actions in HS shortly before that, it was clear to me at least that they were banned because they were repeatedly violating Section 1, Part 4 of the constitution. <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure that the desire to not talk to someone should be absolute.  Of course, that&#39;s probably why mediation is in the constitution.<br><br>There was this guy I knew who said he wanted to be just like Christopher Columbus.

I remember no such incident, and have searched through every message Grimalkinii made on the Discord in an attempt to either find it or jog my memory.

I can so see how you get that, and I&#39;m beginning to think you&#39;re kind of right. But the concept of &quot;I need a thing to happen, how can I make it happen in a way that fits the overall arc&quot; is something that all writers deal with - my method is &quot;if I can&#39;t find what I need in a way that fits all the criteria needed&quot; (which are that it has to be in a fandom both myself and the cowriter of this pair know, it has to be reasonably short, and it has to have a way to be non-combat-oriented in the takedown) &quot;I will make the situation happen myself&quot;.<br><br>Which was, in my opinion, at least as nuanced as Grimakiini&#39;s position of:<br><br>Grimalkinii-02/21/2018<br>you&#39;re essentially engineering a situation so that what you want to happen can happen by writing your own fanfic and then writing a mission based on it. that&#39;s not really improving your writing in any regard.<br><br>The &quot;she can do what she wants&quot; started coming up not as an immediate response, but when Grimalkinii fell back to just repeating his same points without adding anything to the discussion.<br><br>(Also, Grimalkinii, if/when you read this- why did you use they/them pronouns for me consistently through your post, except in the &quot;attack on her person&quot; quote?)</p>

<li>It sucks that a ton of the record is missing. I support not allowing discussion of heavy Real-World topics in real time if it can&#39;t be done without descending into nastiness, which it seems was indeed the case, but the idea of there being a permanent record of what goes on in the Discord, and of the Board being informed of anything major like an allegedly offensive individual being banned, was a pretty big deal in previous discussions. I&#39;m not terribly happy about that being forgotten.<br><br>1.2 If heavy Real-World topics aren&#39;t up for discussion, that may impose some limits on how much you can educate people about sensitive issues that tend to get people riled up. Cute animal pictures only would mean cute animal pictures only. The Discord members should consider the implications of this before making any final decision on what they can and can&#39;t tolerate.<br><br>2. In what there is left to go on, I don&#39;t see evidence of Grimalkinii acting in bad faith. Being in favor of gun ownership to some unknown extent does not automatically make someone a bad person. Asking questions and getting frustrated with the responses does not make someone a troll.<br><br>3. I don&#39;t see evidence of Delta Juliette acting in bad faith, either. We have established previously that one is allowed to say no to a conversation, and no one is obligated to give their time or attention to anyone else.<br><br>4. I have a problem with Maslab kicking Grimalkinii for the sake of &quot;[Maslab&#39;s] blood pressure,&quot; without explaining to Grimalkinii why he was doing it or giving a warning first. I thought there was a three strikes policy of some sort; if there were previous warnings, there is no record of them. It looks to me like a serious abuse of power. That may be something we need to address further.<br><br>5. I don&#39;t disagree with the banning of Pentagon, who doesn&#39;t appear to have even tried to be polite.<br><br>6. I don&#39;t see anything objectionable in the conversation about writing your own badfic to spork. (I&#39;m not a fan of the idea myself, but I think both viewpoints are valid and the choice may be left up to personal preference.)<br><br>... I think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. If anyone else can shed more light on this, or wishes to give their impressions, they should do so—especially if you were not involved. Remember Article 13: the entire community is responsible for upholding the Constitution.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>On real-world heavy topics, I&#39;ve like to point out we managed to have a rather civil conversation about gun control back in early March of 2017, so I&#39;m certainly not calling for a &quot;no politics&quot;/&quot;no heavy stuff&quot; rule at this time. The discussion in #heavy_stuff was, from what I remember of it, rather inflamed by Pentagon&#39;s (and <i>maybe</i> some other people ... I won&#39;t try and name nams without the logs, since I eventually just left that whole debate) approach to it.<br><br>There not being a Board post about this ... yeah, come to think of it, why didn&#39;t that happen? I&#39;d propose, as blanket policy, &quot;chat kicks/bans are to be announced on the Board&quot;.<br><br>For extra context, the official announcements of the kicks (and then bans) in #upstairs were:<br><br>Maslab 🦊 - 03/05/2018<br>Pentagon has been kicked from the server: Multiple counts of purposefully stating incendiary statements designed to elicit an emotional response. A permanent ban is being discussed between the moderators.<br><br>Maslab 🦊 - 03/05/2018<br>Grimalkinii has been kicked for same.<br><br>PoorCynic - 03/05/2018 [later that day]<br>A permanent ban has been put into place for users Pentagon and Grimalkinii.<br><br>Now, to (mainly) my memory, there appeared to be an association between Pentagon and Grimalkinii. Among other things:<br>1) They showed up very close to each other (to the point that I wrote a &quot;please introduce yourself on the Board&quot; message aimed at both)<br>2) They both tended to use terminology like (rot13&#39;d) &quot;phpxrq&quot;, which is associated with the far-right, /pol/, and other groups of people that tend to violate Article 2<br>3) There was a general sense that Grimalkinii was backing up or joining on on Pentagon&#39;s almost-certainly-trolling, especially since they both had a few cases of &quot;I insist you talk/keep talking to me&quot; Article 4-violating behavior (and tended to agree with each other&#39;s points).<br>[there might be other factors applicable here, but that&#39;s what I can think of at the moment]<br><br>Now, it&#39;s possible that this was all a really unfortunate coincidence and we banned a newbie because they shared an arrival time and political views with someone who very clearly needed banning. However, I would say there was enough evidence of a Pentagon/Grimalkinii association that we can&#39;t claim the mods were acting unreasonably or terribly out of line based on the information they had.<br><br>- Tomash<br><br>P.S.: Assuming Mikel is right about what incident &quot;We then switched the topic and asked another member about something they had said; we were outright told to change the subject by the same admin or be banned right then and there.&quot; refers to, I confirm that the moderators&#39; response of &quot;Drop the topic. Now.&quot; was entirely appropriate.</p>

            <p>They&#39;re usually small graphics that show up under messages when people decide to add them (next to each &quot;this&quot; there&#39;s a number saying how many were added, and you can hover over them/right click the message and check &quot;Reactions&quot; to see who reacted that way).

            <p>I don&#39;t go for particular genres or artists in general.  I can pretty much like any song, if there&#39;s something in the lyrics I find True, or if the beat is fast-paced enough to get stuck in my head at work and help me move faster.<br><br>There&#39;s no way I could give a reasonable list of all that I like, but here are some examples:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqfIKqW2ZPo">Old stuff.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnCAmr569k">New stuff.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I">Popular stuff.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdJicpjitMM">Obscure stuff.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTBx-hHf4BE">Stories.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um7pMggPnug">Messages.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POzWc8gC7PU">Mashups.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU9UJCbRMTs">Medleys.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0">Songs whose lyrics I don&#39;t actually understand.</a><br><br>The few bands I semi-follow, rather than just knowing one or two of their songs, are:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8vsuOXZBXc">Paramore.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGPAv1Hq2-g">Fall Out Boy.</a> (<b>NSFW</b> lyrics, <b>violence</b> warning in video)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhPaWIeULKk">Gorillaz.</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGs_qK2PQA">Eminem.</a> (<b>NSFW and homophobic</b> lyrics)<br><br>I don&#39;t generally like instrumental stuff, except for video game soundtracks.  I drive my coworkers nuts sometimes, because I love those thirty-minute-plus YouTube videos that loop a video game track over and over.  My favorite game composer is probably Yoko Shimomura, because she uses so much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9XljBWGrRQ">piano</a>.  I also love how moody and atmospheric the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDNXTwZL3I">soundtrack</a> from <i>Epic Mickey</i> is.<br><br>—doctorlit♪</p>

            <p>Oh right, precisions. Not so sure about genres, but I have preference for music with lyrics. I listen mainly francophones singers, Tits&#39; Nassels, Lynda Lemay, Bénabar, Renan Luce, Bensé... <br><br>On the anglophone front, I prefer mainly Gabriel Aplin, with an eclectic selection after that (Killers, Skillet, Adele, Bonnie Tyler, Brandon Heath,...). I also listen many Nightcore songs.<br><br>Another thing I listen a lot are anime/videogames musics, with or without lyrics. And when it comes to anime songs, it&#39;s the Japanese lyrics and the englis translations of a Youtuber called LeeandLie (plus a few original songs).</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll go for pretty much every genre, even Country on occasion. My taste in bands and artists ranges from Beyoncé to My Chemical Romance, which is the ONLY thing I have in common with Ebony Dark&#39;ness Dementia Raven/TARA/Raven??? Way, to Coldplay and weirder bands like Nero&#39;s Day at Disneyland. They kind of creep me out, but it&#39;s nice to be a little creeped out once in a while. I like Classical and heavily favor Tchaikovsky. I also really like video game music; my favorite ever game composer is Inon Zur, and I absolutely love the stuff he did for the Dragon Age franchise! It&#39;s my favorite ever writing track. My current favorite song (which changes just about every time your average celebrity changes outfits) is Soldier&#39;s Grin by Wolf Parade. </p>

Shout-out to Betty Who, Lemaitre, Passion Pit, The Chainsmokers, Vance Joy, and Zedd for making a few songs that I love, even if I&#39;m not a fan of all their work.<br><br>Gosh, that took forever to type out. But, anyway, I recommend all of these artists; especially the really unknown ones that deserve a lot more love.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone. Some of you may remember me from a few days ago, when I introduced myself to the PPC Discord Server. My name is White Anders, or at least that&#39;s my Internet name for now, and I was told I should introduce myself to the Board by a user who I believe was Tomash. At the time I resolved not to, due to not expecting to have a heavy presence among the PPC, perhaps only checking up on it once in a while to see what might be new. I&#39;m hardly a comedy writer or indeed a writer of any sort myself, so it seemed an ill fit for me to join. That is still my intent, especially now that I&#39;ve read through some of your... dicier discourses. The potential for conflict here seems massive and I&#39;ve no wish to be caught up in one of your disputes; they seem QUITE unpleasant. But since I plan to be on here once in a while, I thought you all deserved to know of my existence, and I may or may not feel inclined to chime in a time or two about the interesting things you get up to, if that&#39;s alright. I thank you all for your time, and wish you happy writing. </p>

            <p>So... I have a question.<br><br>Has anybody here written a PPC mission involving Deadpool?<br><br>Because, uh... I just came to a rather interesting realization.<br><br>If anybody ever interacts with him, he&#39;s going to know about the PPC.<br><br>See, he&#39;s fourth-wall-aware, and would probably know he&#39;s in a fanfic, and if the Words let go of him for a moment, he&#39;ll know it&#39;s dumb but he&#39;ll probably still play along.<br><br>Now here&#39;s the problem: sure, he can be neuralyzed... but it&#39;s not a permanent solution, since he could simply read the Words of the MISSION to get back up to speed. For example...<br><br>--<br><br>[X agent] put the neuralyzer away. &quot;Deadpool, you have never met anyone named Mary Sue, nor do you remember my partner or myself. This has all been a strange dream, but not one worth remembering.&quot;<br><br>Deadpool stared blankly at [X] for a moment, before seeming to realize something. &quot;Oh, this is the part where I&#39;m supposed to nod dumbly and mill about like one of those sheep from <i>Men in Black</i>, right? I mean, that&#39;s a neuralyzer, so...&quot;</p>

            <p>...I don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind pretty much any direction this goes in (&#39;this&#39; being Deadpool knowing about the PPC and how long/when he&#39;d know about it *for*). What I do know is that Deadpool is hilarious and this thread is awesome :D<br><br>Personally, I think it could be very fun for him to know, even if it maybe faded when canon reasserted itself. A bit like Jack Harkness, maybe? He seems to more or less know what PPC agents are, even if he repeatedly forgets the specific instances when they appear. Seeing through perception filters helps with that, of course. At any rate: more Deadpool=good. I&#39;m in favor. Would love to see a mission where he shows up.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>My take on these questions of &quot;but X character is omniscient&quot; is always that they&#39;re only omniscient about their own canon. The PPC is not part of any canon (unless an author someday makes it so), therefore knowledge of it will vanish when the canon reasserts itself.<br><br>OTOH, Deadpool might get a pass purely because it could kinda hilarious for him to randomly pop up in HQ and/or the Board whenever he feels like it. Kinda like how Gaspode the Wonder Dog knows about the PPC, because dogs can&#39;t talk, duh, and no one would ever believe him anyway. Rule of Funny. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...the next event which is not an Emergency but is open to whoever wants to get in on it: Deadpool has somehow gotten into HQ and is popping up in random places to delight, confuse, and mildly annoy. Someone tries to recruit him and is stopped by their more canon-savvy partner. Several people have their lunches interrupted. The authors get mildly nervous. Deadpool sets out on a quest to find some chimichangas.<br><br>Based on this thread so far, it could make for a hilarious lighthearted event or RP, I think.

            <p>Okay, so my big comment is that you did an excellent job of cowriting. Too often, Cowrite Disease strikes, and characters end up rattling off half-page paragraphs to which their temporary partners flawlessly respond point-by-point. (Not that I speak from experience, hem hem.) This story doesn&#39;t do that - it feels like all three agents got the opportunities they need to respond and to comment. (The advantage of having one person write the two in a relationship - when they start talking only to each other, it&#39;s for valid reasons!)<br><br>That said, time for a flashback: remember all my comments about missions that sound like MSTs? Well... you didn&#39;t do that either! The agents were definitely more than talking heads, and I don&#39;t feel like you over-quoted.<br><br>The vestige of MST-disorder that I did notice is that I had a hard time connecting where the agents were to where the Suvian was. Partially because I&#39;m tired, of course (always tired), but it didn&#39;t feel like they were occupying the same space. I didn&#39;t flag any sneaking around, or having to peer through windows, or suchlike.<br><br>I want to throw a particular highlight on the scene in the middle, where I <i>did</i> know where they all were - the whole &#39;spend the night&#39; section. It was an excellent portrayal of the agents, and kept them firmly anchored in the physical world. I couldn&#39;t say whether it&#39;s the best scene, but it&#39;s certainly the one that stuck in my head.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s amazing to hear that we did those things well, because I know exactly what you mean about both talking heads and Cowrite Disease--and I&#39;ve actually been making a conscious effort to avoid them recently, especially the latter, so... basically, fantastic :D (And no, you most definitely don&#39;t speak from experience...not at all... :) What can I say, I was reading early Dafydd missions a month or two ago out of curiosity and because I suddenly wasn&#39;t sure I *had* read more than half of them. More likely it had just been a long time, but who knows?)<br><br>Anyway. Like Ix said, the fic wasn&#39;t too big on setting descriptions, but there are probably a good handful of places where we could add a bit more of &quot;the agents landed in the next scene, made faces at each other, and ducked hurriedly behind a tree.&quot; I&#39;ve already found one while going in to see about GMA&#39;s feedback, actually. If we can find some more spots that we both like, that can go ahead. There definitely is a bit of it in there already, though.<br><br>What else...ah, yes. I&#39;m glad the section in the middle stood out to you; like I wrote to GMA, it&#39;s nice to hear you did specific things right. Especially if it&#39;s an entire section!<br><br>But yes. Thanks for the concrit (autocorrect wants that to be &#39;concert&#39;; do you sing or play an instrument, by any chance?) and the comments! They&#39;re all appreciated.<br><br>~Z, somehow on a roll with responses. On to Tomash! And GLORY!</p>

            <p>Wow, you two really found a bad one this time. I don&#39;t have much to say that isn&#39;t incoherent squeeing at Ix coming out of her shell and Jacques&#39;s introspection at the end; I only noticed one thing to critique.<br><br>Near the end of the mission, Jacques summarizes the bit with Samanthea speaking French, but then that scene is quoted just a few lines later. I think it may have worked a bit better to just have the French scene and then the Agents reacting; the way it&#39;s written, quoting the fic just seemed a bit redundant to me. That&#39;s a really small thing in a long mission full of awesome, though, so great work!</p>

            <p>Re: the critique, you have a point. I originally wrote in the description because I thought they really weren&#39;t going to get there in time to see that part of the scene; when we ended up putting in that they did, I didn&#39;t think to remove it. Good news is it looks like it can be cut out without changing a thing...which is probably as good a sign as any that it should go! I&#39;ll wait for Ix to wake up and have a spare moment, but I&#39;ve marked it in the doc.

            <p>This is why I wish we had a better-referenced Wiki... so from the name, I&#39;d guess logicillion applies logic to the Suvian-ness to make it go away. That suggests that giving it to an unreformed Suvian would essentially have a milder version of Reality Room effects.<br><br>-Unnatural abilities would be weakened.<br>-Characters who liked them for no reason would go off them.<br>-Impossible colours and the like would be muted.<br>-Impossible biology would start to be rejected.<br><br>&amp;c &amp;c. The best place to use it would be when something has happened in the story that would directly debilitate them - for instance if the Suvian has had a transplanted arm grafted onto them, logicillin would likely cause immediate rejection.<br><br>Alternately, maybe it acts as a sort of internalised Reality Room - it helps ex-Suvian agents by making them see/feel the illogic of what they were before. By that measure, you could use logicillin poisoning to shatter a Suvian&#39;s worldview. Imagine them falling to their knees in front of their designated Lust Object, yelling, &quot;Why was I even after you? You&#39;re not interested in meeeeee--!&quot;<br><br>And then they get shot in the head. Because PPC.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I am... not sure. But here&#39;s my take on it:<br><br>Yes, Logicillin might make a Sue easier to defeat. It should <i>definitely</i> have funny side effects. However, within a Sue-warped canon, a sufficiently powerful Sue may be able to shake off the effects. It&#39;s hard to say, and I&#39;d take it on a case-by-case basis on rule of funny (or rule of drama, if you&#39;re Iximaz. :-P)</p>

            <p>Per <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314938">discussion down below</a> we could use more moderators on the Discord. In addition, I&#39;d noticed that we haven&#39;t voted on whether to hand out some of those very shiny Permission Giver hats in about three years. Therefore, I propose killing two birds with one stone and running a combined election for both positions.<br><br><b>Election structure and proposed voting method:</b><br><br>In keeping with what I&#39;m told is how this tended to work before, this thread is <b>not for voting</b>. The purpose of this thread is people to submit nominations for the positions of Discord moderator and/or Permission Giver. Other things this thread should be used for include discussing the nominations and quibbling about electoral procedure.<br><br>The reason I&#39;m structuring the threads this way is that it allows people who just want to cast a vote to do so with only one post once the candidate list has been hashed out, instead of having to hunt around within the nominaitons.<br><br>Election for both positions (Discord moderator and Permission Giver) is by consensus. To keep things straightforward, nominations that appear controversial will not be getting on the ballot.<br><br>There&#39;s no fixed number of winners; we can elect as many or as few people as we like. We could (and in the event there turn out to be no good candidates, should) pick no new mods and PGs at all.<br><br>Vote-like things (such an nominations) from the nomination thread will count as votes (unless the voter changes their mind).<br><br>Both the nominations and voting will remain open until the thread settles down (about a day or two of no activity) or for one week, whichever is longer. A new thread will be created if an active election-related thread falls off the front page.<br><br>To formalize the process a bit, I propose the following: In the vote, you need to have a score of at least <b>+10</b> points to get elected. Votes in favor give you <b>+1</b> point, votes against give <b>-4</b> points (to penalize controversial candidates), and not having an opinion/abstentions is worth <b>0</b> points. (This roughly matches the structure of how Delta and Maslab were elected last year.)<br><br>If anyone has objections to any of the above of proposals for different ways to do it, please reply with them.<br><br><b>How to nominate someone:</b><br><br>Simply reply to this thread saying who you&#39;re nominating and for what. It would be a good idea to explain a bit why you&#39;re making that nomination, but that isn&#39;t strictly required.<br><br>If you&#39;re nominated, you need to affirmatively accept the nomination. Otherwise, I&#39;ll assume you don&#39;t want the job.<br><br>You can&#39;t nominate yourself.<br><br><b>Qualifications:</b><br><br>Discord mods should be reasonably active on the Discord and have been around for a decent amount of time. They should also be someone who would be trusted to enforce the rules fairly and keep the chatroom safe.<br><br>Permission Givers should have, per the wiki, &quot;a reasonable level of activity for a decent amount of time (currently six months, although longer is better), and a dedication to the PPC in general&quot;.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

But I can literally go days without even turning my computer on, if I get stuck in a eat-work-sleep cycle.  So I just don&#39;t feel like I can be a PG with any reliability.<br><br>And that&#39;s putting aside my own discomfort at making decisions that can affect other people.  I know granting/denying permission is a very minor thing in the grand scheme of the universe, but it&#39;s still a level of influence that I don&#39;t have any right to exert over others.  Making decisions is terrifying, and Gan knows I&#39;ve made bad decisions in this community in the past.  I don&#39;t know if I can be trusted with this responsibility.<br><br>So here&#39;s the takeaway: if the community feels that we are lacking in PGs, such that my below-standard service is actually potentially necessary right now, then I will &quot;run,&quot; as it were.  Otherwise, leave me out of this election.  (And considering this PG election was basically just tacked on to a called-for mod election, I think it&#39;s safe to say I&#39;m not needed.)<br><br>—doctorlit, the PG, not that this community needs, but also, one it doesn&#39;t deserve <s>I always butcher that <i>Dark Knight</i> quote, and have probably done so again, but you get the idea.</s> :|</p>

            <p>I was hoping Tomash would bring it up himself, but since he hasn&#39;t: it is relevant that Tomash was previously a moderator of the Discord, and resigned <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=306544;search_term=modship">in March 2017</a>.<br><br>This does not, of course, mean that he cannot be reelected/reappointed, but I feel that it&#39;s important that the people involved in making the decision are aware of it. The last thing we want is an incident later where someone goes &#39;why is Tomash a mod again?&#39; and everyone says &#39;what do you mean &#39;again&#39;?&#39;. Everything will be much better if you have an answer (eg, &#39;we think his later behaviour demonstrates [that stuff Thoth said]&#39;).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You can’t drag <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Hieronymus">the hermit</a> out of his <s>cosy</s> tiny corner in Castle Arkive and make him rule a barony when he hasn’t done any knightly services yet.<br><br>I don’t deserve that honor. I barely recovered from getting Permission when I didn’t feel ready to ask for it. I still have to show that I can write a decent mission, or actually anything that’s longer than about two thousand words. (Okay, <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2016/09b.html#post-167764">Ticket to Ride</a> may count, although it’s intentionally bad, but not bad enough for the badfic games?) <br><br>My &quot;reviewing&quot; is mostly just proofreading, covering the lack of thought with one friendly sentence about how I liked the story – but I’m barely able to tell what I liked and why. (Proofreading <i>is</i> important, and I’m proud on my ability to help out there – and looking back through my archive of everything I posted ever, I actually did better reviews in the earlier years and may be able to get back to that.) Every studious person can get the technicalities right. When it comes to what really requires talent, like keeping characterization consistent while showing character development, I’m not so sure I can do that or see it or the lack of it in others’ works.<br><br>Never being embroiled in a scandal or drama should actually speak against me. Despite occasionally voicing an intent to change that habit, I have a record of <s>cowardly</s> cautiously staying away from potential trouble, only showing up to join the majority when my voice doesn’t matter anymore. Actually, the essence of my life is that I never ever wanted to be a decision maker, and I may not be prepared to start now. <br><br>Giving Permission to a writer who is not obviously perfect? I’m scared of creating a new [redacted].<br><br>Denying Permission to a writer who is not quite there, and then having to explain how they could improve (which is in important part of denying Permission)? I’m even more scared.  <br><br>Can’t you foresee that, whenever an actual permission request shows up, I’ll just hide in a hole until somebody else made the decision? Accepting the PG hat when I’ll probably never use it might be dishonest.<br><br>But know what? I’m a Slytherin, because Pottermore said so; honesty is not on my character sheet. I’ll take that shiny hat, put it on my hatstand, decorate it with my shiny <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2013/08b.html#post-113948">gold medal for being able to write English better than most Americans</a>, and then we’ll see what happens.<br><br>HG, not promising anything</p>

            <p>According to my research, if either Larfen or Hieronymus get elected, they will be our first fifth-generation Permission Givers, where this is defined as &#39;how many steps is it from you gaining Permission back to Jay and Acacia&#39;.<br><br>Jay, of course, was the first generation (with Acacia, but so far as I know Acy never really got into the Permission game). She granted Permission to Bast, Cam, and Thalia, as well as (according to some thread I found) <b>Delta Juliette</b>, our only remaining second-generation PG.<br><br>I got my Permission from Bast, putting <b>me</b> in the third generation, alongside <b>Kaitlyn</b> (I think through Cam), <b>Neshomeh</b> (ditto), and significantly Araeph.<br><br>The fourth generation includes a lot of our current stock of PGs: Araeph gave Permission to <b>Phobos</b> and <b>Zingenmir</b> (and also JulyFlame), Nesh granted it to <b>PoorCynic</b>, and apparently I had excellent judgement in the case of <b>Iximaz</b>.<br><br>Our two candidates, though, are both fifth generation: Larfen got Permission from Ix, and Hieronymus from July.

            <p>Larfen has been around for a few years now. He&#39;s written several rather funny pieces of work set in the PPC universe, including the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbQvbW-V5aFlutLaldGGbq91qUKHUDw6hYECpRVaIPA/edit?usp=sharing">Flaming Broomsticks cycle</a>, which significantly expanded the Janitorial Division.<br><br>He seems to have a good sense of the universe and is around reasonably often. I&#39;d trust him with the keys to the universe, and therefore I nominate him as a Permission Giver.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>...for the sole reason that I have no personal experience with Larfen as a beta, which is a rather important component. I can say however that he writes well himself, is generally fun to talk to (including about written works), and is an active PPCer. If he&#39;s also a good beta, which at least one person down the thread has explicitly stated him to be, I&#39;d say he&#39;s a good choice.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>I saw the title and instantly remembered the fic, despite having had had no contact with the fandom in well over a decade. While I only got 4 recent results out of 20 when searching, it&#39;s a 20 year old fic, and that fact that people are still remembering it speaks volumes about how awful it is.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s bad, but I&#39;m totally lost as to what this fic is, what canon it&#39;s referring to, and how infamous it is. I imagine &quot;Mike and the &#39;Bots&quot; refers to a relatively well-known MST-er. Can you give some more information to orient me?</p>

            <p>Remember when I said the PPC should have a YouTube channel, or that we should start making PPC animations and post them on YouTube?<br><br>Even though that idea didn&#39;t have much effect and didn&#39;t spread around much (fortunately), I&#39;m starting to think that one over a little.<br><br>YouTube is huge, and somewhere out there could be the person who wrote the badfic, or one of their friends, or an equally bad author who wants to stand up for the person, or someone who likes niceness culture, or something like that. That could be dangerous. We could get a flood of demands from these people. That would be bad.<br><br>So I figure that that&#39;s a bad idea and it shouldn&#39;t be done, or at least should be limited to interludes, joke fics we write, sporkings of our own stuff (old/joke fics), and other stuff that happens here that doesn&#39;t have to do with anything any outsider wrote.<br><br>But may I ask y&#39;all this: What is your stance on the PPC and Internet publicity? How much should we broadcast ourselves on the Internet and in real life (likely answer: not much), and/or how much should we attempt to gain new members (likely answer: also not much)? <br><br>Not that what we&#39;re doing now (just being where we are and letting ourselves be found) is bad, in fact, it&#39;s pretty good, and as of late, the only banworthy newbies showing up have all been zdimensia destroying yet another username before anyone else can use it. (I may be wrong on that one, but don&#39;t correct me, or else this thread will be thrown off-topic, I just know it.) However, I like to take things to various next levels if I can, and I have already made several tries at doing so on Scratch (with varying degrees of success), so if there&#39;s any new ideas regarding these things, I&#39;d love to hear them.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to hear your thoughts on this!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The PPC always struck me as a community where its smallness and tightness was one of its most important parts. At least, to the extent that if we started publicising it, attracting heaps of people, we&#39;d need to change a <i>lot</i> about it to make it work, and, well, that theoretical community is just very different from what we have now, ay?<br><br>Need to change the site, change how we deal with issues that pop up (probably a bit harder voting for such things and being all loosey-goosey with it if you&#39;ve got a thousand people spattering out their thoughts!), maybe even change the permission system, and so on and so forth. <br><br>I mean, I dunno, I&#39;m sure it&#39;d still be a nice enough place, but I quite like it as is, too, ay?

            <p>With the big influx of people from TVTropes, we saw a huge shift in the community away from actual fanfic writers. We had pretty much this discussion back then, too. And yep, we had to change the Constitution, and the Permission process (the old style is a lot harder when you can&#39;t just look at someone&#39;s FF.net profile!), we went through years of everyone being constantly told to put things on pre-existing threads... oh, it&#39;s been a wild time.<br><br>In conclusion, in line with this viewpoint, I propose that we kick out everyone who&#39;s joined the PPC since 2010, and get back to the proper old community we had before we got all publicised. Who&#39;s with me? :D :D :D<br><br>-- the point I&#39;m making is, yes, new people bring changes. Some of those changes are bad (we&#39;re a writing community with a steadily declining proportion of writers). Some of them are good (the Constitution is better now, and still improving). Some of them depend entirely on your point of view (personally I would love it if everyone was still an LotR fan). But without them, the community fades, and shrinks, and slows.<br><br>In January 2015, the PPC Board received approximately 1243 posts. In 2016, 1726. Last year, 2017, we saw 812. And this year we&#39;re down to 598.<br><br>... back in a minute.<br><br>Right, I&#39;ve just gone and graphed this. The early numbers are estimates, extrapolated up from the nearest page of subject lines preserved in the archives, but this is how it looks:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MrrF8sB.png"><br><br>2018 is <i>literally</i> the quietest year for the PPC Board since we were founded. In &#39;04 and &#39;05, I estimate we had well over 2500 posts in a month. Now, we can&#39;t even crack 600.<br><br>Tell me again how we&#39;re not running out of newbies?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>is that the PPC isn&#39;t where the fandom is anymore.<br><br>Back in the day, from what I can tell, a bunch of PPC stuff was on Livejournal, which is where a lot of fandom people were (and also FFnet before that). This meant that you could start in typical fandom spaces and find the PPC (maybe you&#39;d need to stumble on something, but it wouldn&#39;t be particularly unlikely).<br><br>However, fandom&#39;s moved to other places, like, say, AO3 and Tumblr, and there&#39;s not a PPC presence anywhere near there. We&#39;re hiding in our corner of the Internet, and there are probably a lot of people who would join ... if they knew we existed.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what can be done here, since I don&#39;t interact too much with fandoms, but that sounds like something we should think about. Because it&#39;s hard to sustain a community no one knows about other than the members.<br><br>(also, wrt those stats - it&#39;s only April this year, and did you pull 2017 numbers from the archives?)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>This thread is all about how we <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> make ourselves known, how we should stay holed up in our little corner. Which I&#39;m against, if my post didn&#39;t make it clear. :)<br><br>I still have filed away a project to put some classic PPC missions up on FFn, as a &#39;Welcome to the PPC&#39; introduction project. I also made sure to post the Driftwood series on FFn, which brought in at least a few people; I think Ix had missions up there, too.<br><br>So far as I know no-one&#39;s posted PPC stuff to AO3; it bears looking into. I&#39;m skimming their FAQs and can&#39;t find anything that would exclude the PPC, though missions would definitely need to cite their original. (They in fact specifically allow transformative works of other fanfic.) --in fact, checking, Zingenmir posted a few things there, and AO3 has actually auto-archived TOS. So I may cross-post Driftwood at least if I get the time; could be worth a shot.<br><br>Other points: the PPC was never really on LJ. We had a community that basically existed to collect people&#39;s personal journals, and another that was to collect in-character agent journals, but we didn&#39;t interact with the wider community. We&#39;ve always been an insular lot. ^_^<br><br>And yes, it&#39;s only April - which is why I made sure to point out that I was comparing January-to-January across the dataset. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I can post more, actually, especially if people I&#39;ve cowritten with are okay with it. I&#39;ve also moved the stuff I posted on LJ to Dreamwidth, which is at least where Das Sporking is now, so maybe that counts as a bit of the community...?<br><br>Lily Winterwood was also posting missions and Multiverse Monitor articles (among other things) on Tumblr, which seems to have at some point actually gained a fic-writing community or seven; while I don&#39;t believe she&#39;s currently doing any PPC writing, the old stories are still up and she mentions the PPC from time to time.<br><br>I always kind of associated LJ with the PPC--the older PPC, from pre-2010, that I grew up reading (yes, you can feel old now. Sorry). That&#39;s why I originally set up there: a bit of nostalgia and continuation of tradition, and, well, why not? There were quite a few people who posted missions there or on Dreamwidth, from what I remember both of that time and of the immense amount of reading I did beginning in 2013 when I became a Boarder.<br><br>I...have lost track of my point a little, but hopefully this makes sense regardless. And yeah, as mentioned, I&#39;m game to post some more to AO3--I was using it as a sort of backup, as well as a kind of &#39;well, why not?&#39; and then kind of forgot about actually posting things on there. It&#39;s been busy.<br><br>~Z<br><br>PS: Speaking of which...hS, a whole bunch of us, at varying times, began university degrees and reached the last couple years of them. That might also impact the posting rates; I definitely know there were times when I barely even checked the Board for months, and certainly wasn&#39;t posting, because of that. It was just too much to balance--this was mainly at the time I was doing two degrees, I think, and was generally just very stressed out.<br><br>PPS: I remember that filed away project! Or at least, it sounds very familiar. Also still sounds like something of a good idea.</p>

            <p>But so did the existence of the IRC, which my research says was created in 2007 and lasted until about 2015.

            <p>I&#39;ve noticed that, over the years, we tend to hover around 50 people if you count &quot;willing to fill out the census&quot;) and 20-30 people if you count as &quot;could be corralled in for a ban vote&quot;/&quot;posts regularly (in the Board or Discord)&quot;/...<br><br>People also tend to leave either near-immediately (a lot of those newbies you mentioned, for example) or after several years (because of real life starting to hit their time harder or sometimes because of Drama). <br><br>So, abusing some terms a bit, the community membership pipeline is Newbie -&gt; Middlebie -&gt; Oldbie.<br><br>If there&#39;s been a noticable drop in how many people are entering the pipeline (showing up and posting), that&#39;s something we should worry about.<br><br>If we&#39;re having trouble with conversion to Middlebie (that is, getting folks to stick around for more than a week or two), that&#39;s also a problem, but a distinct one.<br><br>Come to think of it, do you have Permission Requests by year? That could help point to anything like that happening.<br><br>Middlebie to Oldbie conversion is ... not something we can exert much control over, I think, except by doing fewer things that cause folks to storm off in a huff, which we&#39;ve been working on for the past year.<br><br>So, at the very least, what we want is a small stream of incoming Middlebies (using the term loosely) to replace the ones we lose to external stuff.<br><br>It&#39;s not clear that we&#39;ve been shrinking. Going to look at a September 2011 seems to about the same number of distinct people posting, just that a lot of the names are different.

            <p>There are 43 people who&#39;ve made more that one post on the front page (if we ignore Deadpool, a Mary Sue, and Mythcreant), while only 13 people (again, ignoring Deadpool and Mythcreant) have more than 10 posts (8 of those 13 have over 25 posts).

            <p>For instance, I have been dreaming about making some sort of &quot;PPC Agent Maker&quot; and posting it on dA or something, as a way to attract newbies.

I suggest that maybe to help that, we make a more visible page on the wiki and/or link in the Board description about all the fun things we do here that don&#39;t require/aren&#39;t about Permission and stuff?

            <p>I am a firm believer in the principle that the best way to attract new people is by having them read our stuff (though the last census shows that fully half of our membership came in through TVTropes, which is kind of the opposite). With that in mind, my number one way to draw more people in would be for those of us who are still writing missions to post them where they can be found! For me, that means Fanfiction.net, but AO3 is also under discussion. If someone has a broadly-read fandom blog (as Lily Winterwood did), that&#39;s also a fine place.<br><br><b>hS current status: I have a mission on the verge of posting, which will go up on FFn. I&#39;m also looking to finally carry out the &#39;Welcome to the PPC&#39; project, posting several classic missions there, and potentially crossposting to AO3.</b><br><br>Second up, one thing that sets the PPC apart from other Suvian hunters is that we <i>love</i> concrit. So... how often do we give it? If you read a fanfic that needs work - or is just plain bad - why not review it and offer the author advice on what the problems are and how to improve? And if there happens to be a PPC mission which showcases the same sort of issue, why not link to it? Obviously you&#39;d need to reread the mission first (oh, the horror!) to make sure it&#39;s actually going to help them, not offend them - but aren&#39;t we a community of readers?<br><br><b>hS current status: I posted the &#39;Kaitlyn&#39;s Concrit&#39; section of my Driftwood missions as a review for each author. I don&#39;t think I referenced the PPC, though.</b><br><br>Thirdly, looking more at retaining new members now... post more! The PPC Board used to be bustling with new threads, to the point where they kept dropping off before we were done with them. Now? Now there&#39;s nearly a month&#39;s material on the Front Page. Where are the badfic discussions (<i>discussions</i>, not just &#39;here&#39;s a link bye&#39;)? Where are the debates over canon minutae? Where are the ridiculously overthought questions about PPC trivia? Where are the games, the serious discussions, the ficlets and missions and all the good stuff?<br><br>Well... they&#39;re there, obviously. But there&#39;s many fewer of them.<br><br><b>hS current status: Posted a game! Don&#39;t post about canon much because it feels like no-one&#39;s interested in the ones I am.</b><br><br>And, fourth and finally: look for your own answers. ;) If you care about the PPC community continuing, then don&#39;t just expect a handful of Oldbies to carry it on our shoulders. That just results in very tired Oldbies.<br><br><b>hS current status: Not too tired right now.</b><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The formatting options are better there than on FF.n. For instance, you can post stories as part of a series, which suits a PPC spin-off better than making each mission a chapter in one story, IMO.<br><br>... I wonder if I can label a story as part of multiple series. I don&#39;t think so, but that would solve my problem of what to do with &quot;Gestalt Therapy,&quot; since it&#39;s not exactly part of the RC 1110 series, but also really is.

This one aims to actually provide helpful answers for questions like &#39;What&#39;s a Mary-Sue?&#39;, rather than just ranting at people who don&#39;t like us. I&#39;ve outlined what I think are the questions that need answering, but haven&#39;t written any answers yet.<br><br>3. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">FAQ: On Permission</a> (current FAQ)<br>-This one doesn&#39;t need changing! It&#39;s been repeatedly tweaked to try and give the best answers it can. It&#39;s not perfect, but it holds up a darnsight better than the four named so far.<br><br>4. A trilogy on mission-writing and posting: the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Slash-Sporking_Guide">Slash-Sporking Guide</a> (unchanged), <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Posting_New_Mission_Reports">Posting New Missions</a> (unchanged), and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a> (needs expansion and eventual revamp).<br>-Initially, the Guide will need to accommodate mission-related information from the old Newbies FAQ. Ultimately, it would be great if someone revamped it into a proper guide like the slash-sporking one.<br><br>If anyone is looking for a way to help the PPC community, working on the first two drafts is an excellent place to start! If we can get decent FAQs put together and linked on the Board and Wiki, then new people will have a good chance of understanding what&#39;s going on - and PPCers will have an excellent resource for explaining what badfic is and why it&#39;s a problem.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I would say that all of these are significant improvements, but I want to <i>specifically</i> point to the new FAQ: For Other People. That needs to be finished and used as a replacment for our current one ASAP, and I&#39;ll do my best to help it on its way if I can.<br><br>Yes, there is a reason. That reason is that when I was a several-years-younger lad, and I first stumbled across the PPC, the idea caught my imagination. I thought it was great and amazing and I read TOS and later Tales From DoGA, and I loved it, and I wanted to join.<br><br>But I was young, and insecure, and I had never written fanfiction in my life. I wound up not joining because I was afraid of how the community might react to me, or whether I&#39;d be made fun of or chased away because I wasn&#39;t experienced enough. Fears I would later discover were ill-founded when I did join.<br><br>The original FAQ: For Other People was instrumental in creating those fears. It make the PPC seem like a place to be afraid of, and a group that you had to be an experienced writer to interact with.<br><br>In summary, that FAQ almost caused me to never meet you guys and lead me to fear you. And I kinda doubt I&#39;m the only potential newbie who might be scared off by something like that.<br><br>So if I had my say, the original FAQ: For Other People would be burned around a celebratory bonfire while we all caroused and drank and laughed and talked. And maybe afterwords we could find something Rude to do with the ashes.</p>

            <p>...some of you may remember how I visited-then-realized-I&#39;d-joined the Board thinking you were a ruthless group of critics I could &quot;sic on&quot; a badficcer friend when she didn&#39;t listen to anything I said about her work. The FAQ: For Other People did sort of give me that impression.<br><br>While I did sort of take a little immature happiness at the brutal snark of the original FAQ: For Other People (as I myself sometimes need to be restrained on my critiques of things), I do believe that this is definitely going to have better effects on our relations with outsiders and opponents, how people perceive us, our membership, and all that jazz.<br><br>As I&#39;ve said... two times before?

            <p>... the Wiki includes <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mary_Sue">a nice big article</a> on the term Mary Sue. It starts out with this definition:<br><br><i>A Mary Sue is a fictional character that achieves its goals in the story with minimal effort, out of proportion to what the audience would expect given the setting(s), culture(s), and other inhabitants of that universe. In order to accomplish this, a Mary Sue will have character traits heavily skewed in favor of outstanding attributes over significant flaws.</i><br><br>If you&#39;re volunteering to write the answer to the relevant FAQuestion, which is found in the &#39;What do you mean when you say...?&#39; section (I suggest using a PC; mobiles are notoriously tricky about the wiki), I suggest starting out with a link to the article (there&#39;s code for &#39;See also&#39; somewhere), and basing your answer on that.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was very curious to see how it would go. Turns out, really well! Pasting into the Rich Text Editor makes the process fairly quick and painless.

You can indicate that your story is &quot;inspired by&quot; another work, right in the story-posting architecture. It&#39;s like it was <i>designed</i> for this.<br><br>And BTW, I&#39;d suggest to anyone else doing this that they also include a mention that the spin-off is authorized by the PGs on the PPC Posting Board, so it&#39;s quite clear that is expected.
