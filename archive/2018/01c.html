            <p>General summary, I liked this movie.<br><br>One thing I quite liked was that the protagonist (Eliza) was mute, and that we got subtitled sign language. <br><br>Another was the movie did a good job of having some rather not-good 1960s bigotry woven in somewhat seamlessly (see, for example, that bit at the pie place). This also brings me to Strickland, who was a really good villain: heartless, bigoted,  a ... I think &quot;attempted rapist&quot; works... etc. and he doesn&#39;t see a problem with any of this because he&#39;s superior to that monster and all those other not-quite-human folks (like Eliza or anyone who ain&#39;t white).<br><br>Shout-out to the fact that the amount of language passed on during the montage where that was an element was reasonable (given how short a time span it happened in).<br><br>Getting a happy ending pulled out of all the shooting near the end was nice.<br><br>One complaint is that they roughly spelled out what the ending would consist of right at the beginning took a bit of the tension out of the film.<br><br>These have been scattered, late-night thoughts.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>It was your turn to pick a gift (with Gall Knutsson) according to the list given in the opening post, Neshomeh. I answered because the gift which had been picked up was one of hte ones I had offered, and well... I thought &#39;why not have my agents drop a comment about it?&#39; to start another discussion beyond opening the gifts.</p>

            <p>I think you can chose any gifts from the list given in the initial post of the RP (or rather the second one, thanks to mispost), and it&#39;s up to you to RP the surprise of your agents... or them &#39;stealing&#39; the gift of one of the participants having already one.

            <p>I pretty much copypasted the rules from when I tried to set up a gift exchange last year, and didn&#39;t read them fully when setting up this one. I forgot about the &quot;the one who bought the currently received gift is the next to go&quot; rule, sorry. ^^;<br><br>While eatpraylove and I went by the usual numerical order, the numbers coincidentally matched up so that Backslash took Chris&#39; gift and Chris was the next to go. So I&#39;ll enforce the rule mentioned above for this iteration of the event and have all players disregard the numerical order. As soon as I get home from work, I&#39;ll wipe all the numbers except for the ones who&#39;ve already participated and update each number based on the order in which the player has gone.</p>

            <p>I know a lot of really, really awesome people. Some of them are heroes who&#39;ve helped me through some of the toughest times I&#39;ve ever gone through. Others are diplomats who&#39;ve stayed calm in the face of drama and refused to harbor bad blood. Still more are just delightful, quirky souls who bring a smile to my face every time I interact with them. I&#39;m talking about the people who support their friends, who love their friends, who make their friends&#39; days. I&#39;m talking about the people we love, the people we&#39;d fight for, the people to whom we owe more than we could ever repay. And it saddens me that often times, those heroes go unsung. Let&#39;s fix that. Let&#39;s sing praises of those people who&#39;ve saved our worlds. If you&#39;ve ever met someone like this, please show your admiration and your appreciation below.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t say I know a whole lot of really, really awesome people like Quincy does, but there is definitely one person that comes to mind as someone who&#39;s saved my world. He&#39;s this one guy who&#39;s the best person I know. He is 100% a hero who has helped me up more times than I can count, and I can only hope to be like him one day. He&#39;s unbelievably selfless, heart-meltingly kind, and just... so, so caring. He&#39;s never judged me about anything I&#39;ve done, and I can&#39;t imagine he ever will; he&#39;s the most supportive person I&#39;ve ever met. He can brighten up my day with just a few words and one of his funny and random jokes. I&#39;m not ashamed to say that I have absolutely no idea what I&#39;d do without him.<br><br>Thank you for saving me; I owe you everything. If you&#39;re reading this and you&#39;re the guy I&#39;m talking about, you know who you are and you know there isn&#39;t anyone else I&#39;d say these things about. <br></p>

            <p>There were a good few funny moments throughout (the entirely &quot;doggy style&quot; thing, Ave teasing Zeb about Jacques, the &quot;domestic&quot; part, the superhero landing part), the execution method was clever, and the framing with Elanor&#39;s tantrums was neat.

            <p>So I don&#39;t have, like, an exact date on this or anything. Well, I do, but it&#39;s long after when it started probably... March the 13, 2009. That&#39;s when I made up (well, borrowed) the word that I named my dear Briza- kitten I&#39;ve had for maybe a month plus. I know I was writing this thing for a while before that, but I don&#39;t quite know how long? Anyways, going by the year... it&#39;s been nine years since I&#39;ve started. Nine years of working on the same darn story. Nine years I&#39;ve known these characters. Nine years. I can hardly believe it. <br><br>When I first started, I never dreamed... well, maybe I did, but I never really expected it all to go this far. I thought maybe it would be fun to write, something to do when I was bored. I never thought that I wouldn&#39;t stop. But I haven&#39;t, and now... My project, OBL... it is literally what I feel like I want to do with my life. The one accomplishment that&#39;s going to really mean something to me. And I&#39;m really emotional about this? Because... hoo boy. It&#39;s been such a big part of my life, and I want it to keep going for another nine years. Heck, let&#39;s shoot for 90 years. <br><br>Crazy thing? It&#39;s feasible that in the next couple of years, I may actually finish the first story. </p>

            <p>This is fantastic, sir.  I loved reading this.  You have such a dry, sarcastic, Douglas Adams-y sense of humor to your narration.  I don&#39;t think I could ever manage to reproduce that sort of writing voice, and I&#39;m a little in awe of your ability to keep it going so strongly through this entire story.<br><br>I especially love the long-winded, highly metaphorical descriptions of your characters&#39; personalities and physical appearances.  Also, the little recurring details, phrases and sounds you use to keep all the different parts of the story tied together.  And even with six characters on the page during the framing parts of the story, you use the voices of all six to maximum effect, and they all play off of each other so cleverly and effectively, even the cat.<br><br>Plus, the entire story is just <i>pure</i> humor.  There&#39;s no time to think about the realistic implications of such injuries or whatnot because there are always more jokes taking up my mental space as I continue.  There&#39;s not a single moment of slowness or other weakness to the entire piece.<br><br>You, sir, are an excellent writer, and this story was an intricate work of art.  Well done!<br><br>Errors!  (Some, maybe.)<br>There&#39;s one paragraph in the &quot;Ninetwo and Anne&#39;s Cat&quot; section where you start mentioning a Nineone, but I can&#39;t tell from the context if that&#39;s Ninetwo thinking about another Weed, or if they&#39;re typos.<br><br>&quot;<b>Nineone</b> never understood that, never did. All the grey, and how long - very long - the corridors were. It boggled the mind. It boggled, Ninetwo hastily reconsidered, her mind, which was, among other things, she was certain, very easily boggled. <b>Nineone</b> was not very fond of her own mind, among other things.<br><br>In &quot;Finch and Bingle&quot;:<br><br>&quot;<b>he</b> used much of it comprehending, dissecting, understanding, and lengthily observing and imagining every single one of these potential deaths.&quot;<br>That first &quot;he&quot; should have a capital &quot;h,&quot; since it&#39;s not connected to the dialogue of the previous line.<br><br>&quot;‘Why are you being so loud,’ Finch hissed, covering his auditory sensors with a pair actuators, wincing at every whir and click they made.&quot;<br>I think you wanted, &quot;a pair <b>of</b> actuators&quot;?<br><br>—doctorlit, the most entertained</p>

            <p>The Nineone thing is actually a sort of artefact from earlier developments of Ninetwo, when she was Weed Ninety-One. <br>I&#39;m, er, not sure why I changed that. Probably something to do with how &#39;Nineone&#39; sounds a touch too similar to &#39;Anne&#39; or whatever. <br><br>And I have cleaned up the rest of the errors, all spick and span and cute and toot and this and that; cheers for pointing them out!<br><br>I&#39;ve not actually read as much Douglas Adams as I ought to, but I&#39;ve read enough to take that as quite the complement! I do prize a very sort of, distinctive writing style, and try a lot to try and keep it very distinctive. I mean, people like Vonnegut or Heller - you can <i>tell</i> it&#39;s their writing, just by reading a line of them. Love that kind of stuff. <br><br>And I <i>was</i> hoping for a more of a surreal comedy, more than anything else. Have a bit more variety within PPC fic, y&#39;know?

            <p>I always love seeing more of the Musée, and of Lorelai and Dr. Cornelius.  This new type of &quot;mission,&quot; as it were, is very unique, and I like that there&#39;s an element of difficulty to it without making it dangerous or tense.  Good use of Ekyl&#39;s character, and of the younglings.  A lot of their questions were quite amusing!<br><br>I also like that you found a way to give both Jocasta and Cator screen time, and then honor them with statues and the name wall at the end.  Aside from being nice from our out-of-universe perespective, it feels like the sort of thing Dr. Cornelius would do.  (Or maybe that part is Lorelai&#39;s contribution?)<br><br>A long typo ago:<br>The dimly-<b>lid</b> corridor behind the shelf led to an equally-dim flight of stairs.<br><br>—doctorlit, too old to be trained as a Jedi</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Dear Discord,<br><br>It has been brought to my attention that following recent events, a particular member of the PPC doesn&#39;t like, and is angry at, Iximaz. And that&#39;s fine - I mean, it&#39;s always sad when people don&#39;t get on, but we&#39;re not the Emotion Police here.<br><br>What&#39;s not fine is when they repeatedly use the Discord channel to attempt to influence other people against Iximaz, who was not present (and had made it clear they would not be present). That crosses a line, is beyond the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, and goes against the spirit of Article 9 of the Constitution. I accept that they did this for emotional, not malevolent reasons, but that doesn&#39;t make it okay.<br><br>It is to the Discord&#39;s credit that, as a whole, you did not engage with the attempt, and that at least one person made the effort to shut it down. Thank you.<br><br>Unfortunately, a third member of the PPC took the opportunity to make a direct attack on Iximaz, again in their absence. They said something that they absolutely would not have said to Iximaz&#39;s face, and which attacks them for a repeatedly-stated mental health issue. That is not acceptable, and it is dismaying to me that nobody on the Discord spoke up to point this out.<br><br>I think that apologies are appropriate from the two PPC members referenced here: the one for attempting to sway the Discord channel against Iximaz, and the other for the direct attack. I was always taught that part of apologising is admitting what you&#39;ve done wrong, so I will give them the opportunity to do the right thing without being named; but I do have the chat transcript if it is needed.<br><br>I also think that the Discord regulars need to think very hard about how they react to this sort of activity. Letting attacks and bad behaviour slide should never be acceptable, regardless of who is on either side, and it&#39;s dismaying that this was pretty much brushed under the rug.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Related to the above: there are multiple Constitutional Amendments which have been proposed and discussed, but not adopted (nor have they been explicitly rejected). This seems like a good place to consider them further.<br><br>Please make as many suggestions as you like to improve the Amendments. At any time you can say that you <b>ratify</b> (approve, think it&#39;s good, accept, etc etc) the amendment; this will be assumed to hold until you specifically retract it or the amendment is substantially changed. When the thread dies down, I will count up the ratifications and see if they meet the threshold for each amendment.<br><br>(You can also specifically <b>disapprove</b>; this counts as minus two ratifications for the counting. But if you disapprove of it, it&#39;s better to try and fix it than just say &#39;nah, doesn&#39;t work for me&#39;. Get involved!)<br><hr>
<br><b>The Harassment Amendment</b><br><br><i>A full reworking of Sections One and Two of the PPC Constitution, aiming to: provide a clearer framework for resolving issues; specifically call out harassment as intolerable behaviour; create a more encouraging feel in certain places; improve the structure of the early Constitution.</i><br><br>As a large Amendment, this is given as a commentable link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nG8wOXMgwMpLW1fxqvvR5o2EXEKTJOcjFGkWIpLkG34/edit?usp=sharing">The Harassment Amendment</a><br><br>Current ratifications: I believe 5 (from people who are still around).<br>Threshold for approval: 10-12.<br><hr>
<br><b>The Discussion Amendment</b><br><br><i>To encourage discussion on the PPC Board, and to define how it should be carried out. Reworks Section Four in its entirety.</i><br><br>~~~~~<br><b>Section Four: On Thy Topics Of Discussion</b><br><br>16. If you feel something (e.g. a story, some news, a website, a salmon cannon) might be of interest to the PPC, please go ahead and bring it up. Don&#39;t worry about your interests being too eclectic, either — someone&#39;s likely to be interested.<br><br>17. The PPC community thrives on discussion, and wastes away in its absence. When you post a thread on the Board, try to do so in a way that encourages discussion and interaction. If you&#39;re posting links, you&#39;re encouraged to expand on them somewhat.<br><br>18. That doesn&#39;t mean the PPC is Serious Business! Silliness and insanity are welcome here — even encouraged. Feel free to leave your sanity at the door. Most PPCers do.<br><br>19. There is no Article 19.<br><br>20. The PPC has always been about having a good laugh at badfic, so feel free to talk about it, and post links if you find something you think is worth sharing. If there&#39;s a thread about badfic on the top half of the front page already, go ahead and add to that - otherwise, feel free to create your own! (And when replying to a thread about badfic, or reviewing a badfic, please remember Article 2!)<br>~~~~~<br><br>Current ratifications: 5.<br>Threshold for approval: 8.<br><hr>
<br><b>The Chitchat Amendment</b><br><br><i>To prevent private chats from taking over the Board.</i><br><br>~~~~~<br>(As Article 17.5 in the Discussion Amendment, or 23 in the current Constitution)<br><br>17.5. Sometimes, a discussion between just a few people takes on epic proportions. If this happens, it might be best to take it to the Lounge, or to private emails, rather than consume the Board with your enthusiasm.<br>~~~~~<br><br>Current ratifications: 0.<br>Threshold for approval: 8.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I am aware that just changing the rules doesn&#39;t actually improve the culture. However, having a clear view of what the culture should be can only be a good thing. ~hS</p>

            <p><b>Harassment Amendment</b><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nG8wOXMgwMpLW1fxqvvR5o2EXEKTJOcjFGkWIpLkG34/edit?usp=sharing">See the document</a>. The following points are currently being discussed:<br><br>-Does Article 4 need a rider about harassment in someone&#39;s absence?<br><br>-What should we add to Article 8 to highlight that flaming/trolling in the PPC&#39;s name is Bad? The current suggestion reads: <i>The PPC does not condone any form of trolling or flaming, of anyone.</i><br><br>-In Article 10, can we strike the last sentence?<br><br>-Should the following sentence be struck from Article 11: <i>Remember the foundation of respect that the PPC community is built on (see Article 1).</i><br><br>-Should Article 13 be cut, and its first sentence appended to Article 10?<br><br><u>Current Ratifications</u>: Huinesoron, Tomash, doctorlit, Neshomeh, Thoth, Matt Cipher, twistedwindowpane, The Good Mod Addict.<br><br><u>Ratifications from previously</u>: Hieronymus Graubart, Scapegrace, Aegis(?)<br><br><u>Current status</u>: 11(10?)/12 ratifications; probably can be considered ratified unless major changes occur/someone disapproves.<br><br><b>Discussion Amendment</b>:<br><br><i>Section Four: On Thy Topics Of Discussion<br><br>16. If you feel something (e.g. a story, some news, a website, a salmon cannon) might be of interest to the PPC, please go ahead and bring it up. Don&#39;t worry about your interests being too eclectic, either — someone&#39;s likely to be interested.<br><br>17. The PPC community thrives on discussion, and wastes away in its absence. When you post a thread on the Board, try to do so in a way that encourages discussion and interaction. If you&#39;re posting links, you&#39;re encouraged to expand on them somewhat.<br><br>17.5 The PPC has always been about having a good laugh at badfic, so feel free to talk about it, and post links if you find something you think is worth sharing. If there&#39;s a thread about badfic on the top half of the front page already, go ahead and add to that - otherwise, feel free to create your own! (And when replying to a thread about badfic, or reviewing a badfic, please remember Article 2!)<br><br>18. That doesn&#39;t mean the PPC is Serious Business! Silliness and insanity are welcome here — even encouraged. Feel free to leave your sanity at the door. Most PPCers do.<br><br>19. There is no Article 19.</i><br><br>I feel 17.5 might need a bit of tweaking to account for its position as a rider, but it can also stand as it is. (Nesh - the Harassment Amendment changes these numbers anyway).<br><br><u>Current ratifications</u>: Huinesoron, Thoth, Tomash, doctorlit, The Good Mod Addict, Neshomeh, twistedwindowpane.<br><br><u>Ratifications from previously</u>: Iximaz.<br><br><u>Current status</u>: 8/8. Will be ratified unless disapproved of.<br><br><b>Chitchat Amendment</b>:<br><br><i>(As Article 17.5 in the Discussion Amendment, or 23 in the current Constitution)<br><br>17.5. Sometimes, a discussion between just a few people takes on epic proportions. If this happens, it might be best to take it to the Lounge, or to private emails, rather than consume the Board with your enthusiasm.</i><br><br><u>Current disapprovals</u>: Huinesoron, Thoth, Tomash, doctorlit, Neshomeh, The Good Mod Addict.<br><br><u>Current status</u>: Yeah, I think we can class this as officially rejected.<br><br>More comments are always most welcome. The best Constitution is one that as many people as possible have contributed to.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay, first thing&#39;s first. I admit I was involved in this to some extent, and I apologize for anything I did that may have caused harm. I <b>especially</b> want to apologize for this specific comment I made:<br><br><i>GoodModAddict - Last Monday at 12:09 AM<br><br>TL;DR a newbie came, Drama happened twice, and he left and Iximaz decided to leave the Discord but stay in the PPC. Iximaz will probably be taking a break.</i><br><br>As Quincy pointed out, that wasn&#39;t the full story, and I knew that at the time. I was trying to respond quickly to Mattman, who was confused by the conversation, without giving out information that (while possibly relevant) would violate trust some people have placed in me. In doing so, I only caused more drama, and I&#39;m sorry about that. For what it&#39;s worth, I also think it&#39;s a good thing that Quincy called me out immediately.<br><br>Instead of posting what I did, I should not have posted anything at all. I should have waited for somebody else to summarize what happened and continued the conversation from there.<br><br>With that out of the way, I <b>ratify</b> the Harassment and Discussion Amendments. However, I agree with everyone else who&#39;s commented so far about the third amendment. The Board has too little going on as it is, and limiting what people can post when there isn&#39;t even a problem (as far as I can see) would be counter-productive. I <b>reject</b> the Chitchat Amendment until there actually becomes a problem with people misusing the Board.</p>

            <p>...And I&#39;m glad I did, I&#39;d rather stay out of this argument (though on the off chance I accidentally insult someone while in the chat, I want to apologize beforehand, I have a bad habit of saying/doing things without thinking.)<br><br>And while we&#39;re on it, I&#39;ve noticed that the atmosphere here has gotten rather toxic and I&#39;m sick of it.

            <p>I am very tired of drama. I have offhandedly whinged about it quite a few times, before, and I find it disappointing that it&#39;s just so <i>consistent</i>. <br>So, I was miffed. I was miffed that another drama - which I thought was over with - was brought back into conversation. I was miffed that I attempted (weakly, I admit, and an attempt that I immediately went back on, myself) to drive conversation away from it and it was immediately brought back. <br><br>But miffedness is really all I have going for me. I was annoyed and my blathering gob said something completely unnecessary, which added nothing to the conversation, help cool it down, or anything. I didn&#39;t think big of it at the time, but, well, somebody was hurt and them being hurt can be tied directly to something I said. <br><br>So, I apologise for that. I didn&#39;t need to say what I said - could&#39;ve just, I don&#39;t know, gotten off the computer, squeezed a stressball or whatnot - but I said it. Don&#39;t have anything nice to say, don&#39;t say it, and so on. I never want to be the person who&#39;s hurting someone or getting involved in dramas (the irony being that I have now enrolled myself in one) but there it is. Good effort on my part. <br><br>Sorry. I expressed myself immaturely and I won&#39;t do it again. </p>

            <p><b>The Harassment Amendment</b><br>I&#39;ve left a few comments in the GDoc (which is open for anyone to comment in, hint hint), but my vote is to <b>ratify</b> it, overall.  I don&#39;t think anyone could argue we don&#39;t need it, in light of these situations sometimes occurring.<br><br><b>The Discussion Amendment</b><br>I also <b>ratify</b> this.  More discussion leads to more thinking, which leads to smarter, more well-rounded PPCers.  <s>And I need all your brains as developed as possible before I can connect the entire community into a story-developing think tank.</s><br><br><b>The Chitchat Amendment</b><br>I can remember massive text chains between only two people happening, uh, once, or maybe even twice?  And since the Board displays each page based on number of root posts only, and not response posts, it should hardly matter.  I don&#39;t feel this amendment is necessary or productive, so I <b>disapprove</b>.<br><br><b>Dear Discord</b><br>I don&#39;t want to talk too long about this, partly because I wasn&#39;t present (or was busy on another screen at the time, if I was in fact in the Discord at the time these events took place), and partly because I feel it&#39;s being resolved as this thread goes on.  I will briefly say that  I don&#39;t see the comments posted as being serious or incendiary enough for me to view this situation as anything more than hurt feelings being expressed.  I do, however, agree with Neshomeh that the individual who reported the conversation to Iximaz, seemingly with the intent to create conflict, does owe an apology to at least Iximaz and the other two parties, if not all of us.<br><br>—doctorlit, hopefully staying as diplomatic as he feels</p>

            <p>The harassment amendment as written seem good enough.

            <p>First of all, thank you to the people who supported me. I believe it was Maxewell who provided and alternative explanation on my comments and I have to say that he was right on the money. I hate myself for how I acted during the whole shebang and I cannot apologize for my insensitivity enough. <br><br>Also, I want to make it very clear that I DO NOT HATE IXIMAZ. I am upset, yes, and angry, but I make NO accusation and I expect NO ONE to share my views. And I am so hurt that someone could think that of me. Why didn&#39;t you just come to ME? I wouldn&#39;t... I didn&#39;t even know this was an issue. I would have apologized and explained in a heartbeat. This isn&#39;t...

            <p>And I&#39;ve seen the log, which I very, very much appreciate.<br><br>What I see there is a hurt, upset kid (Quincy and Sprinkles are both about 14, I think?) being hurt and upset and maybe looking for support and reassurance.<br><br>I also see their accurate perception that people tend to unconditionally favor Iximaz over all comers--note Mattman&#39;s comment &quot;Just how bad was the newbie?&quot; indicating that anyone who doesn&#39;t get on with Ix MUST be bad. (And preemptive apologies if I&#39;m reading it wrong, but it does seem telling.)<br><br>I also see Larfen&#39;s accurate perception that Ix leaving has happened before, and may logically be predicted to happen again. Could he have expressed it more kindly? Sure. But I&#39;m here to tell you he&#39;s not the only one getting frustrated with cyclical drama.<br><br>I <i>also</i> see Iximaz in the Discord, making passive-aggressive, emotionally manipulative remarks, when they&#39;d said they were going to stay <i>out</i> of the Discord. I thought that was a good, responsible decision. I want to know why they weren&#39;t called on not sticking to it. I also want to know why someone thought it would be a good idea to run and tattle to them in the first place. Did you really think that would result in anything good, for Ix or for anyone else? <i>Why?</i><br><br>Because as Ix is a member of this community, so Ix is responsible for their behavior, just like the rest of us, and so we are responsible for holding them accountable. I&#39;ve said it before, and I&#39;ll say it again: enabling someone with a problem is not helpful to them. All of you, stop it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>the general commentary about Iximaz, I did not, and still do not believe that it was meant as an attack on their person.

Not from life... but he&#39;s never coming back to the PPC.</i><br><br>--On the back of a summary of the relevant events, making sure people know that there are other wounded parties.--<br><br><i>Quincy Jones-Yesterday at 11:11 PM<br>That is not the full story, but it&#39;s not my place to tell it.</i><br><br>--Following a request to drop the subject, making sure people know that they don&#39;t want to drop the subject, and setting up a &#39;me or Ix&#39; conflict - not again that Iximaz was not present.--<br><br><i>Quincy Jones-Yesterday at 11:13 PM<br>sighs Honestly I feel like we&#39;re just whitewashing over the issue, but since the relevant people have left, I&#39;ll let it lie.<br>But... I&#39;ll be really happy if Iximaz comes back to y&#39;all. I will be, honest. Y&#39;all deserve to have them back. It&#39;s just... if they do return, it&#39;s probably going to be &quot;you guys&quot; instead of &quot;us&quot;.</i><br><br>--With no real additional context, making sure people know they&#39;re still angry, and still don&#39;t want to drop the subject.--<br><br><i>Quincy Jones-Yesterday at 11:16 PM<br>sighs again<br>gets angry<br>This may be over for y&#39;all, but it&#39;ll haunt me for the rest of my life.</i><br><br>In isolation, some of these posts are understandable (making people aware that Mr. Sprinkles won&#39;t be returning, or highlighting that the description offered isn&#39;t entirely complete). But with the five of them coming in a 15 minute period, despite repeated requests from other people to drop the subject (and these are Quincy&#39;s only comments in that time period, followed by one that said &#39;Agreed [to topic change]. Apologies for inciting.&#39;), there is a very clear picture being built up of someone who wants to be sure nobody forgets that they Have A Problem with Iximaz.<br><br>I will hold off on commenting on the other person I mentioned until they have a chance to reply for themselves.<br><br>~<br><br>Is this Horrible No-Good Drama? No - that&#39;s hyperbole on your part. But this is <i>a problem</i>, and one that has the potential to escalate. Rather than waiting for it to come to that, I felt it was far more sensible to nip a relatively small issue in the bud.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To the first comment: Considering that Quincey was on the other side of the drama the last time, that comment wasn&#39;t ridiculous to make. <br><br>To the second comment: Nothing about this comment is an issue as far as I can see. It was related to the discussion, and was not written in a way to stir up drama. If anything, it was letting everyone know that that side of the previous drama is closed.<br><br>To the third comment: that was before the request to drop the subject, and in response to a very simplified summary of what had happened in the previous drama. The request to drop came two messages later.<br><br>To the fourth comment: This was the actual response to the request to drop it. At worst, this reads as a bit of ranting, and it is mostly due to the simplified summary not including anything of Sprinkles&#39; side of the story.<br><br>And to the fifth comment: This could be an issue, maybe, if the conversation was talking about Ix at this point. Quincey, at the least, and most of the chat in general, had moved the discussion to Sprinkles. Not Ix, but Sprinkles. <br><br>The fact that Quincey apologized afterwards, and that the chat in general shut down the conversation when it began to be an issue, shows that there isn&#39;t really a problem there. The community did what we should have done, and trying to follow up events which should just be allowed to die with this is not going to help.</p>

            <p>You say: <i>Quincey, at the least, and most of the chat in general, had moved the discussion to Sprinkles.</i><br><br>That... isn&#39;t true. Absolutely, at 11:06 (by the transcript), the conversation moved to Mr. Sprinkles, but at 11:13 Quincy Jones moved it back to Iximaz (in the fourth comment). Larfen then continued to discuss Iximaz, and Good Mod Addict&#39;s &#39;they&#39; cannot refer exclusively to Mr. Sprinkles without some seriously contorted reading. At best it could refer to both (as &#39;the relevant people have left&#39;), but the most natural read is that &#39;it&#39;s not a question of deserving&#39; - as a reply to &#39;y&#39;all deserve to have [Iximaz] back&#39; - confirms the whole comment as a reference to Iximaz.<br><br>Quincy Jones&#39; comment #5 directly follows that point. The conversation was very clearly about Iximaz at that moment.<br><br>~<br><br>I do not feel that using a PPC public space to say &#39;I&#39;m angry at [person who isn&#39;t here]&#39; is ever acceptable. I would be and have been deeply upset when people have done that to me, and I&#39;m sure most people would be.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If so, it was never my intent to turn anybody against Iximaz. I know you guys love them; I&#39;d never want to do that. Never. I personally do not like them very much, but... they&#39;re your friend, and you&#39;re their friends. I would never intentionally try to defame anybody within this community. If you&#39;ll see my messages on the chat, I never said anything bad about them- and I never wanted to. </p>

            <p>During the conversation on (I believe) the 21st, you made five separate comments to remind everyone present that you were angry at Iximaz. The way you present them makes it clear that you want people to come around to your viewpoint:<br><br><i>Quincy Jones-Yesterday at 11:11 PM<br>That is not the full story, but it&#39;s not my place to tell it.</i><br><br><i>Quincy Jones-Yesterday at 11:13 PM<br>sighs Honestly I feel like we&#39;re just whitewashing over the issue, but since the relevant people have left, I&#39;ll let it lie.</i><br><br><i>Quincy Jones-Yesterday at 11:16 PM<br>sighs again<br>gets angry<br>This may be over for y&#39;all, but it&#39;ll haunt me for the rest of my life.</i><br><br>You repeatedly raised and re-raised the point that you are angry at Iximaz. You didn&#39;t do this to try and resolve things with Iximaz, because Iximaz wasn&#39;t there. You didn&#39;t do it in a way that suggested you were looking for people to help you work through that anger. You did it in a way that suggested you were trying to make sure everyone remembered that (in your view) Iximaz Done Wrong.<br><br>As I said, I have no problem with you not liking Iximaz. What I have a problem with is you repeatedly bringing up the fact that you don&#39;t like Iximaz, in a way which can only result in either you getting told to stop - or people coming round to your point of view.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Harassment Amendment</b>: I think this is generally good. It may be a bit long, and I feel that the language used in article 4 (on Harassment itself) is probably too specific, accidentally excluding types of harassment that aren&#39;t listed.<br><br>I would also like to find somewhere to include language along the lines of: <i>You do not have the right to someone&#39;s time or attention. Everyone has the right to prioritise their own mental wellbeing, including cutting off communication with others if that communication is damaging to them.</i> Not sure where it would go, though.<br><br><b>Discussion Amendment</b>: We hashed this out fairly recently. I would ratify this.<br><br><b>Chitchat Amendment</b>: This was pulled out from the Harassment Amendment (since it addresses something entirely separate). I don&#39;t think this is a problem we actually face, and I think I have to <b>disapprove</b> of its inclusion; the Board is quiet enough that a &#39;private&#39; chat can actually be invigorating, and can draw in other people.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My thoughts:<br>- I&#39;m not going to comment on Quincy&#39;s behavior at the moment. I feel a bit too emotionally tied in at the moment, if that makes sense.<br><br>- I think Larfen&#39;s comment has been blown out of proportion. That doesn&#39;t seem like an attack on anyone because of their mental health issues, and more pointing things out with an undertone of &quot;not this again&quot;. <br><br>Now, is complaining about someone behind their back but still in public good? No (especially given various previous incidents), but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough to spark a Major Drama or the like.<br><br>- I should clarify to Nesh that Ix would briefly pop into the Discord to announce mission/interlude postsings then immediately leave.<br><br>- Ix&#39;s comment that &quot;[Quincy] just said what y&#39;all were thinking.&quot; is inaccurate, since I certainly don&#39;t feel that way, for one (and, from the logs, neither does Delta?). An apology for insinuating the entire chat hates them/doesn&#39;t care about them/... is in order, from the looks of it.<br><br>- From what I&#39;ve seen over the last few days, I&#39;m a bit worried about Ix&#39;s mental state currently. I&#39;m not sure if anything unusual&#39;s up, but, if it is, I hope in clears up soon.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>First, I want everyone to know that I don&#39;t think hS was wrong to raise his concern, even though I disagreed with his interpretation. It would have been better if whoever went to him had spoken to Quincy and Larfen first, and it would have been better if hS had spoken to Quincy and Larfen before bringing it to the Board. However, it is important to raise concerns when you see them so that they can be resolved, whether that&#39;s by putting them in a new light or by corrective action taken, or even both. Let&#39;s please acknowledge that he acted with the best interests of the community in mind, of his own volition, and not as an attack.<br><br>Second, it is always okay to remove yourself from a stressful or dangerous situation for your own health. It&#39;s been expressed to me that what&#39;s been said by me and others about Iximaz in this discussion might convey the opposite message, and that is not what I intended at all. No one is obliged to stay in a situation that makes them uncomfortable.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(This topic being discussed in a separate thread from the amendments seems like a good idea to me, even if it was an accident.)<br><br>I think I&#39;ve seen all the apologies I need to see except possibly one: whoever felt the need to fan the flames of Ix&#39;s trust issues by telling them people were discussing them in the chat.

They are avoiding the place for a reason, and I suspect it&#39;s a good one. Let&#39;s make it a clean break. People can check the Board for new posts themselves, or someone else can carry the news in.<br><br>- Nobody reports on what goes on in the Discord to Iximaz. They are avoiding the place for a reason, and I suspect it&#39;s a good one. Respect that.<br><br>- Going forward, nobody in the PPC Discord discusses Iximaz at all. They are avoiding the place for a reason, and I suspect it&#39;s a good one. Respect that. If you have something to say to or about them, good or bad, do it on the Board. (And btw, do try not to discuss <i>anyone</i> behind their back. If you have a problem with someone, tell them to their face [following the Constitution, of course]. If you have good thoughts about someone, tell them that to their face, too!)<br><br>- PMs and emails are an entirely separate thing and are not under discussion at this time. We cannot presume to have any control over what people talk about with their friends in private. HOWEVER, if bad things are happening to you in private, do please come forward to someone. We really don&#39;t want anyone suffering in silence.<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Let me just stress that this is a proposal, not a dictation.

            <p>First, an addendum: Iximaz isn&#39;t banned from the Discord, they removed themself. If they do decide they are comfortable returning at some point, I suggest that they state their intention clearly, on the Board, just as they stated their intention to leave. That way, everyone may be aware that the situation has changed and why.<br><br>For now, though, I want to make sure that we put a definitive cap on this thing and that everyone can move on comfortably. So, let&#39;s give it over the weekend for people who might not have time to jump in during the week.

            <p>I&#39;m honestly crushed that this... whatever it is... happened. I feel like what I said, if it was out of line, is nowhere NEAR Board-level. That being said, I still don&#39;t really feel like I went out of line, especially considering what I posted after the controversial stuff. What it looks like to me (though I am admittedly rather biased, and I feel the need to specify that I AM NOT REGARDING THIS AS THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH, because apparently expressing my opinion/discomfort sics hS on me??? Maybe that was a bit unnecessary but that&#39;s how this whole ordeal has made me feel, dang it) is that y&#39;all saw me saying something &#39;against&#39; Iximaz and decided immediately that I had to be punished for it. Again, I’m not saying that’s what happened, I’m saying it’s how it make me feel. Because I, too, have feelings. I&#39;m legitimately scared, now, that this will happen again, that I&#39;ll be thrown onto the Board without even having gotten a warning. It is not as if I always do this! And the way hS just went after me... I don&#39;t know if I feel welcome on the Board anymore, and I certainly don&#39;t feel welcome on the chat knowing that somebody was there and decided to indict me without even talking to me about it first. To that end, it pains me, but I think I&#39;m just going to have to take another hiatus! And whoever reported me to hS... next time, JUST TELL ME. I SWEAR I AM NOT EVIL. I DO NOT WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. SURE, I PROBABLY OVERREACTED??? BUT I WOULD HAVE LISTENED IF YOU WOULD HAVE JUST COME TO ME. All you&#39;ve accomplished by doing this instead is upset *everybody* over an issue that could&#39;ve been resolved through a quick PM. Unless your intent is to harm me?? In which case, congratulations, you&#39;ve succeeded! <br><br>I just wanted to come back and be with my friends. And then... THIS. Maybe it&#39;s my fault? I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t really *feel* like I&#39;ve done anything egregious. Maybe I&#39;m paranoid. I told myself I&#39;ve been overreacting, but as the day goes on, I just get more and more sad. But... I can&#39;t believe this happened. I don’t even feel like I did anything??? I don&#39;t know! I&#39;m scared this will happen again and I don&#39;t know if I could handle it. I hate this, all of it. It’s making me wish I never joined the PPC. I mean, can I not also be upset/hurt/angry over what happened, or is that a premium right reserved for those whose names are Iximaz??? Please, somebody. I just want to know why something of this magnitude happened over something so small. <br></p>

            <p>From where I&#39;m standing, they look like they assume a lot of negative intent on Quincy and Larf&#39;s parts. That&#39;s ... understandable, I suppose, assuming someone had poked you with (I&#39;m probably exaggerating this, as I have no idea what happened before you asked me for context and logs) &quot;People are being terrible and mean on the Discord, here&#39;s a screenshot&quot;.<br><br>That is, your interpretations were one of the valid ways to read the logs (they weren&#39;t completely out of nowhere) but that they were really improbable etc. .<br><br>I think the lesson here is that this sort of thing is one  reason we have an &quot;don&#39;t assume negative intent&quot; clause in the Constitution. <br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>So, er, considering I <i>was</i> one of the people with the dismaying and inappropriate behaviour, I can understand taking what I say with a grain of salt and such, but so on, so forth. Also, pardon for being so late, but I didn&#39;t want to add my own thoughts to such a raw situation I was a part of, and, well, I dunno, better to say something than nothing at all, right?<br><br>I don&#39;t think hS was necessarily entirely in the wrong, in this situation. Consider the fact that he&#39;s just sort of sat there, then someone comes to him telling him of bad things happening in the Discord - again - and that he and he alone ought to be the one who sorts this all out. It&#39;s a disconcerting situation, and I can <i>entirely</i> see why that would lead to him wanting to make a Board post. The very act of it being brought to him was escalating the situation into &#39;Major Drama&#39; and that&#39;s not really the fault of hS. Though it was hS&#39; ultimate choice to, obviously, make the Board post, I can entirely see the processing that led to him making said post. <br><br>I think the most questionable part comes in from whoever it was who went to hS in the first place. You have, here, a person who is concerned about the direction in which a situation is going, but doesn&#39;t say a single thing about it, and instead silently goes off and reports it to someone considered a &#39;higher up&#39;, as it were. <br>I disagree with this. <br><br>We needed - at least, I know <i>I did</i> - to be encountered on our behaviour, no doubt. And I appreciate that, and I&#39;m glad we have a community that expects people to be encountered on bad behaviour. But, then, as Quince mentioned way earlier, why weren&#39;t we messaged at the time? <br>And I can understand, as well, the idea of bringing issues to the Board. That&#39;s a thing we do, so that we have a wider variety of opinions on a situation, don&#39;t lock certain people out of a decision that may affect them, and all. But in almost every previous occasion we had something brought to the Board, we all knew about it. It was mentioned in chat and we all agreed &#39;sure, bring it to the Board.&#39; Our latest situation certainly wasn&#39;t! <br><br>Had there been better communication, this situation wouldn&#39;t have blown up nearly to the proportions it would have. There was no reason at all for Quincy and I to have not been contacted beforehand, whether through PM or just through the PPC Lounge chat itself. Were we really acting so irrationally as to have been totally unreachable at the time, leaving the only reasonable option being getting hS? <br><br>I don&#39;t like this attitude conveyed. I like to think we&#39;re all reasonable and mature enough to be able to stick a hand on each other&#39;s shoulders and say &#39;hey, you&#39;re out of line, cut it out.&#39; and reply &#39;Oh, you&#39;re right, sorry.&#39; and finish it off right then and there, without any needless escalation or unnecessary legality. I&#39;m disappointed that we&#39;re not even <i>trusted</i> to be able to do that. <br>And I don&#39;t like the Orwellian sense that there is a person - or persons - sat there silently watching for anyone to mess up so they can instantly bring it in front of everyone, to hS, to the Board, without them even <i>knowing</i> about it at all until it suddenly pops up on the Board out of nowhere. There&#39;s obviously situations - have been situations - where a situation has to be brought up to hS, but I disagree with how that was the <i>first</i> solution, to the extent that Quincy had to <i>ask</i> if hS&#39; Board post was about her. </p>

            <p>&quot;Ewwww!!!&quot;<br><br>Maisarah is reeling in disgust as she sees the animal perching on top of Clarissa&#39;s head.<br><br>&quot;Neh, a hamster! I trained my little chubby bubby puppy to hide in my hairs.&quot; Truly, Clarissa&#39;s hair fashion is... traditional. It looks like the beehive hairstyle, but most of the hair are shaped to a large bun. A small hamster is lazily strutting to and fro on top of Clarissa&#39;s head.<br><br>Aziz wiggles his index finger at the fluffyball, which the animal responds by sniffing at the digit. &quot;Don&#39;t you feel uncomfortable having things running on your head?&quot;<br><br>Clarissa massages her neck, tired from keeping her head straight. &quot;A little. My neck&#39;s hurt though.&quot; She slumps her back and rests on a pile of books on the desk. The hamster hides itself snugly between the hairs. A few other classmates watch in awe at the animal clutching at its master&#39;s hair and dozing off, until the bell rings to signal the start of class.<br><br>The class begins with a Math class. Teacher Zahirah have just returned from her maternity leave, and looks unusually giddy than the usual.<br><br>Aziz and Shamsul is slumped on their chairs at the back, trying to make sense of her diagrams. Aziz begins to snore softly when Shamsul jabs his finger at Aziz&#39;s ribs, jolting him awake. <br><br>The frizzle-haired Aziz rubs his eyes. Shamsul begins his whining. &quot;Why are we learning about circles and angles and letters?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a good question. We aren&#39;t Greeks trying to make circles and being stabbed for it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, you remembered Teacher Chong&#39;s story yesterday!&quot;<br><br>The both of them snickered when they remembered how their History teacher expanded a few paragraphs of their history textbook about some mathematician into half an hour of rambling about being a genius in a mediocre world.<br><br>Teacher Zahirah is about to turn and inquire about why the backsitters find circles to be funny when she sees Clarissa&#39;s hairstyle. Well, the teacher does not care for the hairstyle, it is not exactly against the rules. But there is a creature she can see lurking behind the large bun on her student&#39;s head. <br><br>She half-heartedly draws and explains how a triangle, whose base forms the diameter of the circle, will always be a right-angled triangle should the third point touches any point on the cirlce&#39;s line. But her drawing turns to an organic creature, a mix between a mite and a hamster.<br><br>The class laughs at the resultant figure. Teacher Zahirah slams the duster on the blackboard and wipes the offending imagery from her board, and with it, imagining it gone from her mind. She wipes her chalked hands on her baju kurung, claps her hands, and with the most motherly of smiles, leans to the star pupil with the retro hairstyle.<br><br>&quot;Clarissa Wong Mei Li, may I examine your hair?&quot;<br><br>Clarissa thought it over for a few seconds. She is sure to have let her hamster back into the cage before the class begins.<br><br>&quot;Sure, teacher. Just dont ruin the hairstyle. It&#39;s hard to repair.&quot;<br><br>Teacher Zahirah  carefully runs her fingers to her pupil&#39;s head, trying to find the offending object.<br><br>The hamster, being disturbed from its slumber by a pink earthworm, chomps on the new meal with a decisive bite.<br><br>Teacher Zahirah pulls her finger back in pain, to discover a rodent dangling, looking at her with innocent eyes. It squeakes.<br><br>&quot;Opocot a mite has feather hairs! Eh, it has hairs! Swinging like a pendulum, always maintaining it&#39;s swinging time no matter the size of the swing! Eh, Hamster dangling on my fingers!&quot;<br><br>Teacher Zahirah keeps her latah even as she darts back to the teacher&#39;s office. In the ensuing chaos, many teachers begin to latah along, even breaking to a gamelan and zapin dance. Other teachers try to calm them down or call the ambulance as some latahing teachers and students decide to jump from the higher floors. The entire school populace unafflicted by the latah just stares in wonder.<br><br>Shamsul could muster no reaction on his face, seeing the adult populace of the school turning an institution of learning to a traditional Malay moshpit. &quot;I wonder, do you think Teacher Chong know anything about the history of latah disease in our town?&quot;<br><br>Aziz gently rubs his forehead. &quot;I wonder if we will be cursed with latah if we reached a certain age.&quot;<br><br><br></p>

            <p>“<i>Themes</i>,” Anne grumbled.  “Why does anything even need to have a theme?  Why can’t a story just be a story?”  She tapped her pencil against her blank paper.<br><br>“Because a story just being a story is good for nothing,” said Wilma, a haughty lilt in her voice.  “At least with a theme, we can apply something to real life and get use out of it.”<br><br>Anne sneered across the desk.  “You are <i>brainwashed</i>, girl.”<br><br>Wilma raised her head and gave a glare.  “I’m realistic.  Artsy stuff doesn’t do any good.  We should all be more like Irwin.”  She lowered her head and went back to writing.<br><br>Anne gave a quick look at Irwin.  Then she did a double-take.<br><br>Irwin was the only non-organic classmate in Anne’s class.  It had showed up in the Nursery not long after Mollie and Ollie had been dropped off, and got added to the class along with them.  The robot was tiny, barely over a foot tall, and its body was basically two half spheres with a gap between.  Out of the gap sprouted a glassy orb on a wire, with another wire sticking out the top of <i>that</i>, which led to a very tiny but detailed satellite dish.  Another wire stuck out of the gap on Edwin’s “back” end, which connected to a thin metal halo which encircled its entire body.  Everything was a dulled and tarnished grey, except in all the spots where ugly rust had grown over the metal.  The halo and the satellite dish tottered back and forth whenever Irwin moved.<br><br>Right now, however, the satellite dish was jittering back and forth at an alarming speed, in concert with a pencil scribbling furiously on the paper in front of Irwin.  (Irwin was sitting on top of the desk; otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to see.)  Irwin had filled nearly an entire page with writing in the time it had taken Wilma to do one paragraph.<br><br>The pencil continued to move, without being touched by Irwin.<br><br>“Okay,” Anne said, “I had no idea you could do that, Irwin.”<br><br>The satellite drooped to the side.  The pencil stopped moving and fell over.<br><br>Anne stared.  “Uh.  I’m sorry?  I didn’t mean to, like, scare you, or anything.”<br><br>Irwin remained still.<br><br>“Just, it’s cool.  That you can do that, I mean.”<br><br>Irwin remained still.<br><br>“And it’s . . . okay?  That you can do that, I mean.  You don’t have to hide it from us.”<br><br>“And she was willing,” said Irwin.  Its voice came tinny and surrounded with static, like a radio that was only barely tuned to the station it was trying to play.<br><br>Anne stared for a moment, then looked at Wilma, who had stopped working to listen.  Despite their earlier disagreement, the girls now shared a look of confusion.  “That’s . . . good,” Anne finally said.  “Good to hear.”<br><br>Irwin remained still.  Eventually, the girls both went back to focusing on their own papers.  Neither looked up when the sound of Irwin’s pencil on paper began once more.<br><br>* * *
<br><br>Fox sat with his back against the wall.  Across the room, Marty and Edwin were playing Sorry!, Marty as the yellow player, and Edwin as the red.<br><br>Fox watched as Edwin’s satellite swiveled, and a card drew itself and flipped over.  The swiveling continued as one of the red pieces moved the correct number of spaces.  Then the swiveling stopped again.<br><br>Marty gave Fox a meaningful look.  They had both heard about Edwin doing homework the day before from the girls.<br><br>Fox said, “So I guess the big question is, what is that thing coming out the top of your head?”<br><br>Edwin’s voice crackled out, “A tin can, she thought—B&amp;M beans or Campbell’s soup.”<br><br>Fox blinked.  Marty, drawing the next card, said, “Uh.  Okay.”<br><br>While Marty moved one of his pieces, Fox said, “But how does it—how do <i>you</i> work?  How are you doing <i>that</i>?”  He pointed at the card Edwin was now drawing from the deck.<br><br>The crackling radio noise came again.  “Nor can we tell you so you’ll understand.  That’s all over your face.”<br><br>Fox blinked.<br><br>Marty leaned in close to Edwin.  “It’s all right to tell us, okay?  We’re your friends, now.  We’re just curious about what you can do.”<br><br>Edwin replied, “Stand, be brave, be true, stand for your brother, your friends.”<br><br><br>Marty raised both eyebrows in surprise, drawing back just a tad.  He then turned to Fox and shrugged.  “My turn,” he said, and drew a card.<br><br>* * *
<br><br>“Thank you for coming here with me,” said Nostrum.<br><br>Irwin rolled along behind him, leaving a pair of furrows in the snow between the centaur’s hoof prints.<br><br>Nostrum stopped at the crest of a hill, looking up at the artificial sky.  “My people place great importance in the stars.  There are many things that can be read from the way the stars arc across the sky from year to year, night to night, hour to hour.  <i>These</i> stars are artificial, of course.”<br><br>Nostrum folded his legs and kneeled down to get closer to Edwin’s level.  “My people are not . . . scientific, as humans would say.  We read the stars, but we don’t know why or how we are able to do so.”  He looked down at the robot.  “I do not understand your functioning, or what that machine on top of you is, or how it works.”  He laid a hand on Edwin’s chassis.  “But I like you.  Don’t let the questions of the others bother you too much.  Humans like to understand things as they are now.  But I think you and I like to see things farther ahead, yes?”<br><br>Nostrum stood up.  “Let’s head back to the Bunks.  We must rest for our classes tomorrow.”  He began to trot back to the doorway that led into the corridors.<br><br>He didn’t hear Edwin crackle from behind him, “Once you get into cosmological shit like this, you got to throw away the instruction manual.”<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>doctorlit&#39;s note:</b> I will never be able to prove this, but I swear, <i>I swear</i>, <b>I SWEAR</b> I designed Edwin before BB-8 was released in <i>The Force Awakens</i>.  I SWEAR YOU GUYS.<br><br>—doctorlit swears, you guys</p>

            <p>Irwin&#39;s a really interesting character, and it&#39;s nice to see more of a snapshot into Nursery life, especially how it is for nonhumanoid people. One minor point, though; you seem to veer between calling your robot frendo Irwin and Edwin throughout the fic. Which is it? One assumes Edwin from the title, but I could be wrong. =]</p>

Then her head collided with the top bunk and she bounced back down onto the pillow. There were words. Most of them had four letters.<br><br>&quot;Sooooo, d&#39;you remember what today is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;with a rusty- mwha? No, not really, too busy being in pain at the moment.&quot;<br><br>Em stepped back and spread her arms wide. &quot;It&#39;s your unbirthday! Wooooo!&quot;<br><br>&quot;... I don&#39;t follow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that means we&#39;re going out to celebrate-&quot;<br><br>&quot;You wake me up in the middle of the night to tell me <i>this</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s three pee emm, Cass.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, and I&#39;m still technically a student. Three in the afternoon indeed. What the hell kind of waking-up time is that? What sad, demented people are ready to do anything by then?&quot;<br><br>Em quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Most of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is both lies and slander.&quot; Cass still stretched, yawned hugely, and glanced at one of the clocks. &quot;Anyway, look, it&#39;s only twenty past five in the morning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s the clock tells time in Tahiti.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then today I am being Tahiti-ish. Tahitian? Tahitese? One of them.&quot; Cass blinked and rubbed her eyes, moving her thick mane of hair out of the way and tucking it behind her ears. &quot;Wait. Hold on. What&#39;s that coming out the top of your head?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh...&quot; Em paused, smiled sheepishly. &quot;It&#39;s a plume.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know it&#39;s a plume, but - wait. You&#39;re wearing a knight helmet. Why are you wearing a knight helmet?&quot;<br><br>Em lifted the visor up and rubbed her brow, the movement of her wrists making the metal hinges squeak. &quot;Look, Cass, I know you don&#39;t go out much, but... well, a few days ago I went to the cafeteria and a <i>huge</i> fight kicked off. Some doofus in a uniform showed up and started posturing, and Sally from group therapy - you know, the ex-Suvian from NCIS? - saw her and had a flashback, and before I could do anything there was this mass brawl. And, and I hadda get out, y&#39;know? An&#39; I got dinged in the head by a plate on the way out, which is... which is why I&#39;m wearing the helmet.&quot;<br><br>Cass just sat there, staring. Then she got up and wrapped Em up in a wordless, fierce hug.<br><br>&quot;Thanks, Cass.&quot;<br><br>Time passed.<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t want to go back alone, do you, Em?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gurl, I don&#39;t wanna go back <i>period</i>. But I have to eat, and I have to make <i>you</i> eat - yeah, Cass,&quot; Em raised a hard, forestalling the objection, &quot;I know I&#39;m not your carer, but you kinda suck at remembering to eat most of the time. I just... yeah.&quot;<br><br>Cass let go and stepped back. &quot;Well, I&#39;d better go and get dressed then. But before I do...&quot;<br><br>She fished her wand out from under her pillow and flourished it at Em. The other girl&#39;s clothes suddenly ballooned outwards and adopted a metallic sheen, as well as joints, hinges, and a general armoured theme. Alas, the newly-Transfigured suit of armour still had the same Paw Patrol print as Em&#39;s pyjamas, but it was the thought that counted.<br><br>&quot;Uh, what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now you match!&quot; Cass grinned and hugged her partner again. &quot;Right then. Let&#39;s get this over with. I&#39;m... actually hungry for once.&quot;<br><br>And so they wandered off towards the cafeteria, clanking noisily, arm in arm.</p>

            <p>Nice, simple little story.  I like Cass&#39;s attitude towards sleeping times, and the unnecessary background detail in the explanation for the helmet, and the pajama-print armor at the end.  I also like that when Cass discovers the reason for Em feeling vulnerable, she immediately stops acting sleepy and irritable and becomes supportive.<br><br>—doctorlit, down at 9 PM, up at 4 AM</p>

            <p>To start, for the record: I tried to come up with something to make the pants prompt work.  I do want to make an effort to participate in each one, but in this case, my characters just aren&#39;t the sort to be pantless.  But I am sorry for ignoring that one.<br><br>A) Honestly (and in light of wanting to participate in every one, both writing a prompt and commenting on all the others), every other week is <i>way</i> too often for me.  I think once a month would be a lot more manageable for me.<br><br>. . . But of course, I&#39;m only one data point.  I recognize it&#39;s not fair to everyone else to do it less often just because I&#39;m in a bad work situation right now and have almost no functional free time.  I&#39;ll certainly bow to the popular vote on this.<br><br>B) Literally doesn&#39;t matter.  If you&#39;re ever busy, shoot me a message in any medium, and I&#39;ll happily do it for you.<br><br>C) Literally anything.  From anywhere.  In fact, have some random ideas:<br><br>*short snippet of the EPC version of one of your PPC characters<br><br>*short snippet of one of your PPC characters before they joined<br><br>*snippet of an AU version of one of your PPC characters if they were background canons in a continuum of writer&#39;s choice<br><br>*someone turns into an animal unexpectedly<br><br>*a piece of equipment malfunctions<br><br>*a stranger arrives<br><br>*meeting a Flower from outside your character&#39;s usual department<br><br>*an entire room disappears<br><br>*your agents encounter a physical sign of past events and  react to it<br><br>*adventures of a mini in HQ<br><br>*a store in New Caledonia<br><br>*visiting someone from pre-PPC life<br><br>*how one of your characters would react to/think about the piece of real world media you most recently consumed<br><br>*meeting an animal (or plant?) your character never encountered before<br><br>*gnomes<br><br>*cafeteria food<br><br>*making a mess and trying to clean it before it gets noticed<br><br>*a ghost, maybe?<br><br>—doctorlit is aware that most of these only work for PPC characters.

            <p>First, I think that writing prompts are an excellent idea, even though I probably won&#39;t participate in them. That&#39;s not because they aren&#39;t interesting but more because I am a lazy person and writing is hard (I&#39;m mostly kidding).<br><br>That said, nobody&#39;s forcing you to come up with prompts, as Phobos already pointed out. If you feel like you don&#39;t want to do it anymore, then that&#39;s perfectly fine! I just think it&#39;s a good idea to have something come up for people to write about aside from missions or roleplay, whether that&#39;s in the Discord or on T-Board.<br><br>Speaking of T-Board, I think it would be fun to have more things happen there. I realize I&#39;m not the best person to suggest this (as, again, I&#39;m probably the least active person here in terms of actually doing anything with characters), but I think things can be done besides holiday RPs and the occasional birthday party. Again, I don&#39;t know who&#39;d come up with RPs or how often to do them or anything else about logistics, I&#39;m just throwing the idea out there.</p>

            <p>A) Won&#39;t comment on this, since I am not writing from the prompts.<br><br>B) I think a better question is: Do you, Novastorme, want to continue posting prompts?  If &#39;yes&#39; then please continue to post prompts.  If &#39;no&#39; then maybe someone else will step up.  If &#39;sometimes&#39; then maybe find a partner and pass the responsibility back and forth between you.<br><br>C) I don&#39;t think it matters where a prompt comes from.  If you don&#39;t have time/energy/inspiration to come up with a new prompt, then absolutely use any resource you have access to.  It can be a lot of work coming up with something specific enough to speak to people, but broad enough not to write itself, and we understand that.<br><br>Remember, you haven&#39;t been at this long and it can take some time to figure out what works.  Try not to get discouraged when a prompt doesn&#39;t grab your audience.  That is going to happen, and that isn&#39;t a reflection on you.  All you can do is keep trying, learning, and working to improve.  Eventually you will look back and be amazed at how far you&#39;ve come.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I have two questions. First, is there a preferred or recommended length for a piece before it should be split? My original intention was to make my story a 3-parter, one per part of the trilogy, but it&#39;s getting so long that I am considering splitting it in two. <br>My other question is how much quoting from the fic is too much? I want the characters to react to the Words, but I don&#39;t want to overdo it. </p>

            <p>A comfortable mission length for most people to read seems to be about 15-30 pages (varies with font size and margins), but there&#39;s nothing wrong with going over that if you&#39;ve got enough story for more. The main reason <i>not</i> to extend a mission is to cover an entire fic in excruciating detail. You don&#39;t have to go through the whole thing with a fine-toothed comb, especially if it&#39;s practically a novel itself. Once you get a significant canon breach and a convenient point for your agents to jump in, you can end it.<br><br>As for percentage of quotes, there isn&#39;t a number we can give you. My personal rule of thumb is that I quote anything that I think needs to be seen to be believed. That can be in the sense of  &quot;wow, can you believe how funny/terrible/bizarre this is?&quot; or it can be because I&#39;m spinning a hopefully-funny interpretation of it and need people to see I&#39;m not just making it up with no justification.<br><br>Corollary: If it&#39;s boring, don&#39;t quote it.<br><br>As with any story, you just need to make sure that everything in a mission has a good reason to be there, and it will be fine. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That would be bad if I forgot, since everyone else is giving you birthday presents. I&#39;ve got two for you. One virtual, and one real, since while I haven&#39;t interacted with you really all that much (my favorite instance being in the Badfic Games), you&#39;re one of the Boarders that I remember relatively well when I&#39;m not on the Board.<br><br>Virtual present: Here is a two-handed sword that has been enhanced with a fantasy substance I&#39;m studying. Don&#39;t grab the sword, the blade&#39;s very sharp and you don&#39;t want to scratch up things. This cushion to hold it is also for you. Hold out your forearms and hold it like a tray of food. Ah. There you go. [You examine the sword. It has a long, straight blade made of gleaming iron, with fantastic designs depicting suns, angels and more, inlaid with a rose-gold-ish material. The hilt is made of stone, under a thin layer of similar rose-gold stuff, with a section of it wrapped in black leather as a hand grip.] That peachy colored stuff is the fantasy substance. It&#39;s not as dangerous when it&#39;s refined as when it&#39;s in raw form, hence why it will only cause your enemies to feel an intense burning sensation where they&#39;ve been cut and experience hallucinations, instead of undergoing a full-on transformation like they would if this were a sword made of the raw stuff. The people who created this sword, who I stole it from, like to pretend that only the &quot;right&quot; user can wield it to its full potential, but that&#39;s absolute baloney. That&#39;s why I gave it to you, because you are nowhere near their definition of the &quot;right&quot; user, so you can make them really mad by being living evidence that they&#39;re very wrong about one of their most prized weapons. I&#39;ll tell you more if you stick around long enough.<br><br>Real present: I&#39;ve gotten very into Overwatch recently and today I had an idea to draw some of us Boarders as Overwatch characters that fit our personalities. I was having trouble coming up with a sixth Boarder and their character for the &quot;here&#39;s the team that won&quot; drawing (or a fifth Boarder, if the dude I&#39;m trying to recruit doesn&#39;t show up). I looked through the characters and how the fandom tends to depict them, comparing them with your &quot;How to Be Thoth&quot; post, and I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll put you as Genji. Congrats, you&#39;re now part of one of my Board memes, and with the character you have, you don&#39;t even have to send a doodle of yourself. Just tell me your favorite color for me to use instead of the green details on the design so that people who look at it can recognize that it&#39;s not just Genji. Or if your favorite color is green (me too), lemme know what I could do to tweak it and make it recognizable as being &quot;Thoth in cosplay.&quot;<br><br>Have an awesome birthday.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Rudi's Pub was moderately busy. Agents, Operations staff, and the various other denizens of HQ (along with the occasional person who'd fallen in from elsewhere with a <em>thump</em>) came in and out, looking for food, drink, and/or company. They seated themselves at the bar or at one of the many tables and booths throughout the place. There was a moderate background buzz of conversation in the room, but not enough to make anyone nearby hard to hear. </p>

            <p>LOL: Lam Orchall &#39;Ladha [echoing voice of superior laughter]<br><br>This phrase invokes the haughty laugh of, say, Feanor, preferably right before his comeuppance. It&#39;s a twofold acronym: it both describes the laugh, but also describes something worth laughing at (Sindarin speakers being quite happy to see Noldorin pride come before Noldorin fall).<br><br>Oh, and...<br><br>#AwesomeInAdunaic<br><br>LOL: Lôkhî Ob Lômi [crooked before nightfall]<br><br>This is a Numenorean idiom. It describes the practice of getting a little tipsy (or &#39;crooked&#39;) <i>before</i> night comes, which was viewed as preferable to getting blind drunk <i>after</i> it got dark. So it means &#39;drunk, but in a good, friendly way&#39;. (Look, there&#39;s only two L- words in Adunaic, I&#39;m struggling here.)<br><br>#OwfulInOrcish<br><br>LOL: Lug, Olog, Lug [tower, troll, tower]<br><br>Or, as the old story goes, &quot;Bagronk the Uruk was caught between an enemy tower and an angry troll. So what does old Bagronk do? He fights the troll! He kills it! But what does he find? There&#39;s another tower right behind him! Har har har!&quot;<br><br>(This story, and others like it, is extremely popular among the smaller breeds of Orc. It is distinctly less popular among the larger Uruks, who have a tendency to tear off the heads of those they hear telling it.)<br><br>And Agent Râmwê would never forgive me if I didn&#39;t include:<br><br>#ProperInPrimitiveQuendian<br><br>LOL: Lindâ Oijâ Lauka [sweet, endless warmth]<br><br>The only <i>true</i> description of laughter, as he would say, if he was willing to speak any language other than Primitive Quendian, which he isn&#39;t.<br><br>hS</p>
