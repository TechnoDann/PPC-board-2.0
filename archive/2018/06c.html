            <p>I&#39;m generally speaking the retro-gaming guy around here. So it&#39;s my job to point out all the classics. By which I mean, the ones you shouldn&#39;t avoid because they&#39;re actually good. I&#39;ll try to avoid pointing out anything I assume you all already know about (No, I&#39;m not putting Fallout anything on the list, although I did get both the originals and a few of the new ones, and they are on sale). So... here goes.<br><br>-Baldur&#39;s Gate - Actually, don&#39;t buy this. Well, don&#39;t buy it on Steam. Baldur&#39;s Gate is a classic, and it&#39;s the game that earned BioWare its name. However, the version on Steam is the &quot;enhanced edition&quot; which has garnered mixed reviews because it apparently alters the writing. As of this time, there is no good way to buy the original Baldur&#39;s Gate from Steam or GoG. Pirate it, or grab a secondhand DVD copy (which is what I did: they&#39;re pretty affordable).<br><br>-Planescape: Torment - This time around, the people who did the Enhanced Edition did good. So you can buy this on Steam or whatever, nice and easy. Apparently they caught on that a game that is beloved and revered, largely for its writing, doesn&#39;t need alteration on that front.<br><br>Planescape: Torment, like Baldur&#39;s Gate, is an oldschool CRPG-type game. It&#39;s an I-hope-you-like-text sort of game, so be warned. But if you do like text, the writing is well known for its strength. Also, notably, this is one of the rare old CRPGs which you can apparently get through without ever using combat. So... that&#39;s a thing.<br><br>If you liked Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, or Fallout: New Vegas, you should probably know that Obsidian Entertainment and InXile were both formed by ex-Black Isle Studios developers, who worked on this game, Fallout, and the aforementioned Baldur&#39;s Gate. So... yeah.<br><br>-id software woooo - TL;DR, Thoth loves id software. Go buy Doom, DOOM, Quake, or whatever. Then go download a modern sourceport, and if you bought Quake 1 or 2 look up how to enable the soundtrack.<br><br>-Eidos - Basically, every single Eidos game is dirt cheap right now. That means all the Tomb Raiders, all the Just Cause games, and so on. Go go go go go.<br><br>-Looking Glass Studios - Yes, these are in the Eidos category, but they get their own listing. Because Looking Glass Studios deserves it.<br><br>Looking Glass Studios, for the uninitiated, is one of the most influential developers of the 1990s, and a pioneer of 3D games. Not all of their games are available on Steam, but their Thief series, a pioneer of first person stealth, is. As is System Shock 2, which really should need no introduction. And speaking of looking glass, $1 can also get you...<br><br>-Deus Ex - widely considered one of the best PC games ever released. It&#39;s a bit fiddly to get running on modern systems, so to recap what I had to do:<br><br>1. Select OpenGL as the renderer, no matter if the game tells you it&#39;s &quot;unsupported&quot;. The game lies.<br>2. Open the game&#39;s folder on Steam, open the file DeusEx.ini in the &quot;System&quot; folder, and under the section &quot;[Engine.Engine]&quot;, add a line that says &quot;FrameRateLimit=60&quot;<br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s a pain. But the game is good.<br><br>-Another World - A great adventure game-ey thing. But you may have to look at a walkthrough once or twice, and you will die. A lot.<br><br>-X-COM - Any of them.<br><br>-Xenonauts - It&#39;s classic X-COM with a fresh coat of paint.<br><br>-Civilization - Every Civ game is brilliant. Pick your favorite, but Civ IV is the cheapest one right now (7.50 for the full game with all expansions).<br><br>-Frozen Synapse - not a classic, but a dang good game. There&#39;s a demo, so you can try before you buy.<br><br>-FTL - Another non-classic, but it&#39;s the archetypical roguelike and if you don&#39;t own it already you should go buy it.<br><br>-Strife: An obscure Doom-engine FPS, it had RPG elements before it was cool, had an overworld you could freely explore, an actual story and quests and stuff, and was generally both fascinating and ahead of its time. The Steam version is updated for modern systems, with nicer graphics, better controls (I think), and a ton of content that was left on the cutting room floor in the original release. It&#39;s fun.<br><br>That&#39;s it for now. I&#39;ll probably think of something as soon as I post this, but whatever.</p>

            <p>Borderlands 2, Just Cause 3, The Witcher 3, and Darkest Dungeon.<br><br>It should really go without saying, but I heavily, heavily recommend Life is Strange (though it deals with sensitive topics like suicide, rape, and murder, so just a heads-up if you&#39;re triggered by that). It&#39;s an excellent choice-based story driven game with puzzle elements to it, and I cannot stress enough how much the ending will make you cry. It&#39;s excellent.</p>

            <p>No, there&#39;s not a live-action film you don&#39;t know about... I&#39;m talking about the classic children&#39;s movie with the talking foxes and hissing snake. Oh yes.<br><br>Not too long ago, I realised that it was possible to pin <i>Robin Hood</i> down to a very specific point in time. The film ends with King Richard&#39;s return, but that&#39;s the thing - Richard the Lionheart only visited England twice: once when he was crowned in 1189, and once after being ransomed out of captivity in 1194. He may have also popped back over the Channel during his wars in France in late &#39;94, but after that he never returned.<br><br>Since the setting of <i>Robin Hood</i> is very clearly one where Richard has been away for some time, we can pin the film rather precisely to spring 1194. Richard was freed from captivity in February, and we know he was back out to the wars before the year was out. This fits with the visuals, too - the trees of Sherwood are green, but there&#39;s no sign of summer fruits or autumn fall.<br><br>1194 was also the height of Prince John&#39;s power under Richard - because his brother was in prison! In fact, while the brothers&#39; mother was working to collect enough gold to ransom her elder son, John actually offered his captors money to <i>keep</i> Richard in prison. It certainly explains why he didn&#39;t want to hear about him, doesn&#39;t it?<br><br>Now that we&#39;ve got that settled, here&#39;s the thing that really puzzled me: Maid Marian. Normally, she is a noble lady who knew Robin in his childhood, but this film takes things a step further:<br><br><i>Klucky: Believe me, someday soon, your uncle, King Richard, will have an outlaw for an in-law.</i><br><br>Wait, what?! Marian is Richard&#39;s <i>niece</i>? That puts her in a tiny category of historical figures: she has to be either the child of one of Richard&#39;s siblings, or one of his wife&#39;s.<br><br>We can narrow that down further by eliminating Queen Berengaria&#39;s family entirely: the queen was from Navarre, down between Spain and France, and didn&#39;t even visit England until after Richard&#39;s death. Since we know Marian knew Robin when she was younger (and since she doesn&#39;t have a Spanish accent), we have to assume that she&#39;s of the Royal Family of England.<br><br>So who could she be? Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine had eight children in total, but the list can be whittled down very easily:<br><br>-William, Count of Poitiers, died age 3. She can&#39;t be his daughter.<br>-Henry the Young King died in 1183, childless, at age 28.<br>-Matilda, Duchess of Saxony, died in 1189, around the time of Richard&#39;s ascension. She had five children who survived to adulthood, but four of them were boys, and the fifth (another Matilda) was married off by Richard in 1189.<br>-Obviously she can&#39;t be Richard&#39;s daughter, not that he had any.<br>-Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, died in 1186, but left behind three children. We&#39;ll come back to these.<br>-Eleanor, Queen of Castile, had a whole host of children... with her husband, the king of Castille. Most of them died young, and the daughters who didn&#39;t ended up married to Spanish and French kings.<br>-Joan, Queen of Sicily, had one daughter (also called Joan), but she wasn&#39;t actually born until 1198. No.<br>-John... well, she <i>could</i> be Bad Prince John&#39;s daughter, but I feel like that would probably have come up in the film? Maybe?<br><br>Okay, so let&#39;s go back to Geoffrey. As stated, he had three children, though one (another Matilda) died before 1189. The youngest child was a son, Arthur, Duke of Brittany, but the eldest was a daughter... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor,_Fair_Maid_of_Brittany">Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany</a>.<br><br>Eleanor is very nearly a perfect fit for Marian.<br>-Her father died when she was two, leaving her to be raised by her uncle Richard.<br>-John hated her. She actually had a better claim to the throne of England than he did; in fact on Richard&#39;s death she was legitimately second in line, after her 12 year old younger brother. John ended up imprisoning her in 1202 for the rest of her life, a further 39 years. (They left that bit out...!)<br>-She was out of the country for a time prior to Richard&#39;s return, but came back before he did. Specifically, she was sent to Austria to marry Duke Leopold&#39;s son, but turned back when the duke died. This would definitely fit with the plot of the film, which has Robin going on about how much she&#39;s grown.<br>-She never (historically) married, despite being described by Wikipedia as &#39;the most marriagable princess&#39; due to her status. Richard tried to marry her off in 1195, and again in 1198, but it never worked - perhaps because of her secret former-outlaw husband?<br>-<b>Her name literally has &#39;Maid&#39; in it.</b><br><br>There are only two real problems with this theory, both of them easily solvable.<br>-Her name is wrong. Conveniently, in most versions of the Robin Hood tale, Marian spends some time in a convent - and in most convents, the nuns <i>change their names</i>. The most common new name, in fact, is some variant on Mary... say, for instance, Marian?<br>-Er... Eleanor was about 11 in 1194 (Wikipedia gives her birthdate as 1182-84). That makes Robin Hood <i>super skeevy</i>. And yet... she was being proffered for arranged marriages by 1190, and actually sent to formalise them by 1193. Clearly King Richard had <i>no</i> problem marrying her off at such a young age.<br><br>Which does leave the question: if she was such a valuable commodity, why would Richard marry Marian/Eleanor off to some minor outlaw nobleman? The answer, surely, is plain: Arthur of Brittany was a little boy, and Marian was the only other person who could stand in the way of John&#39;s claim to the throne. She was still a child... but Robin wasn&#39;t, and he had just proven that he could stand up to John. He may not have been the successor Richard wanted, but he was a darn sight better than the alternative.<br><br>(I now want to see a sequel about Prince Consort Robin&#39;s fight to secure his wife&#39;s throne against Bad King John... I can&#39;t be the only one, right? :D)<br><br>hS, oo-de-lally</p>

            <p>[i]Robin Hood[/i] is one of my favorite Disney films. That intro music is something I can still whistle at mere mention of the movie.<br><br>I had never thought about the historical context. How accurately it all fits makes me think about how much more thoroughly people were educated in the past.

            <p>I&#39;m very tempted to write it myself. I wrote a little fanfiction for Disney&#39;s <i>Robin Hood</i> when I was a kid, but it never went very far, because I always thought the movie tied itself up very nicely and it didn&#39;t really invite addition. But this is the perfect opening for a really fascinating (and historically relevant) story! I have a lot of writing projects right now and I recently got a job so I might not have time, but in the event that I do, keep an eye out for the beginnings of <i>Robin Hood</i> fanfic by yours truly? If Huinesoron is okay with it, of course. After all, he was the one who did the research and picked it all apart.<br><br>I also love the fact that you picked this apart so thoroughly.  It&#39;s a fascinating question: I knew from a young age that this version of Marian had a claim to the throne that potentially put her on John&#39;s radar as a rival, but I&#39;d never stopped to think whether or not it fit with the historical facts.<br><br>And I&#39;m really glad other people still think about this movie. It&#39;s definitely my favorite version of <i>Robin Hood</i> and probably my favorite Disney film and I think it&#39;s very underrated. (And I rather hope they <i>don&#39;t</i> remake it as a live-action flick. For one thing, it would really just be a somewhat more realistic animated movie, and I don&#39;t think it needs any updates or additions.)</p>

            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IeqHFC2.png"><br><br>Things aren&#39;t going so well here in the animal kingdom. Ever since King Richard - God bless him - passed on, bad ol&#39; Prince John&#39;s been trying to hold onto the throne. He&#39;s already done for Prince Arthur, and had Princess Eleanor - that&#39;s Maid Marian to you, of course - locked up, and now he&#39;s on the hunt for our Robin Hood.<br><br>See, if there&#39;s one man that all the poor folks of England can get behind, it&#39;s Robin Hood. When they heard his wife had been jailed by the Prince, why, they just rushed to Sherwood Forest to help him out. And, you know what they say: when you&#39;ve got that many people gathered together, they&#39;ll always have need of a minstrel...<br><br><i>Robin Hood and Little John<br>Gathering an army<br>Rallying the villagers and<br>Leading them away.<br>Off on a Crusade the way<br>King Richard did in olden times<br>Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally<br>Golly, what a day.<br><br>Not for them the battles<br>in Jerusalem or Germany,<br>They&#39;re heading to a city nearby.<br>Where John and all his cronies,<br>With the Sheriff and their soldier boys<br>Are keeping Lady Marian inside...<br><br>Robin Hood and Little John<br>Marching with their army<br>Off to rescue Marian<br>Off to save the day<br>Concentratin&#39; everythin&#39; on<br>Plannin&#39; for their victory<br>Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally<br>Golly, what a day.<br><br>Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally<br>Golly, what a day...</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>In writing this, I realised that King Robin&#39;s War <i>also</i> fits perfectly into the history of the period: it&#39;s the events surrounding the signing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta">Magna Carta</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barons%27_War">First Barons&#39; War</a> that followed (when John refused to keep to it). That was an uprising of the nobility, fighting to protect their rights against John, and ultimately the war ended in John&#39;s death and the accession of his 9-year-old son to the throne. As a bonus, Magna Carta was also signed by the bishops, so Friar Tuck clearly has a part to play.<br><br>This theory would put Robin Hood in the place of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fitzwalter">Robert Fitzwalter</a>, leader of the Barons&#39; armies (bearing at one point the delightful title &quot;Marshal of the Army of God&quot;). The name works very nicely (&#39;Fitzwalter&#39; is just &#39;son of [his father] Walter&#39;, and Robert-&gt;Robin is an easy shift), and the biography... well.<br><br>Robert was associated with various lands, mostly a long way south of Nottingham, but Wikipedia makes mention of unidentified northern lands. That&#39;s enough to let us speculate on the Sherwood connection (after all, he wouldn&#39;t exactly rebel out of his own bedroom!). It&#39;s interesting to note that, in 1201 (three years after John claimed the throne), Robert was engaging in legal battles over a stretch of forest near one of his castles...<br><br>Robert was married, possibly around 1194, to a woman named Gunnora de Valognes. Interestingly, the de Valognes&#39; castle was demolished by King Henry back in 1177, so it looks like the family may have been relatively insignificant. Did King Richard encourage his niece to take a false name, to hide the fact that the second in line to the throne had married a minor noble?<br><br>Robert actually fought in King John&#39;s armies in France; would our Robin do that? Well... why not? Marian was only second in line, and her younger brother wasn&#39;t pressing his claim. To all intents and purposes, John was the rightful king. He made sure to curry favour with Robert - making him warden of Hertford Castle in 1202 - so while I doubt Robin was <i>happy</i> with it, it seems plausible he would have gone along.<br><br>1203 was the turning point. Robin was in France when he heard the news: Gunnora/Marian/Eleanor had been imprisoned by John in December, and her brother (captured the previous summer) had vanished in John&#39;s custody, presumed dead. Robin must have been desperate to return to England and rescue his wife - but disastrously, he was taken prisoner by the French and held to ransom. Given John&#39;s previous involvement in trying to keep King Richard imprisoned, could this all have been an evil scheme of the Phony King?<br><br>Robert was released sometime between 1204 and 1206, but his rebellions didn&#39;t start until 1212 (when, according to him, King John tried to seduce his daughter Matilda o.O). Would Robin have been willing to wait six years to even start his plans to rescue Marian? Given how much John moved her around, and how on-guard he would have been against Robin, it&#39;s certainly possible.<br><br>The idea that Eleanor/Marian was rescued during the rebellion actually, surprisingly, holds up. When Robin/Robert forced John to sign Magna Carta, he insisted the king release all his hostages - but Eleanor wasn&#39;t mentioned. Clearly, she had already been released.<br><br>History tells us that Gunnor, wife of Robert Fitzwalter, died sometime between 1211 and 1222, and that he married a second woman named Rohese. Given that &#39;and then Marian died&#39; is a miserable ending, I think we have to assume this is another false name; Rohese ended up outliving Robert, which makes sense when we consider how much younger Marian was than Robin. And in a final helpful coincidence: Eleanor the Fair and Rohese died within 5 years of each other, both in the 1240s.<br><br>It&#39;s not perfect, I know... but once again, it actually hangs together much better than I would have expected.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Didn’t the average life span result from many children dying young? Whoever had survived the first ten years could expect to live much longer than the average 30 years. Wikipedia tells me that Eleanor actually died at the age of 57 or 59, which apparently was not considered exceptionally old. I don’t know whether the false assumption that, due to the short average life span, girls must get pregnant as soon as they can to see their kids grow up was actually a thing historically.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Hello, all.  As many of you know, I have put out the call a couple of times over the years for people to loan me their characters for Catastrophe Theory.  Well, I&#39;m back to writing it again, and I find I am running out of characters.  Not really sure what happened to all of them, yet, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find out.<br><br>So, if you want to see me do some terrible things to your characters (just ask the Hippie Sequoia, if you don&#39;t believe me), sign them up today!  (Technically, they needed to be part of the PPC before mid-2015 for this to work, but I won&#39;t tell if you don&#39;t.)<br><br><br>Some context, for those who need it.<br><br>Catastrophe Theory is an apocalyptic future timeline.  Nothing good happens to anyone there.  This is the future that happens if the Sues win.

            <p>You can use any of mine you&#39;d like. The kids would be pretty grown up by then. In spring of 2010 Helen was 9 months, Hannah 11 years, Kevin was 8 and Kyle 9.

            <p>I&#39;m actually pretty sure that they would both have died by the point the story takes place in.

            <p>While the idea could potentially be played for laughs, I think most of us would take one of several other options:<br><br>1. The agents may stop the badfic before it gets to that point. The poor mini doesn&#39;t deserve that, after all.<br><br>2. There&#39;s a thing called a <a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Simulation_Generator">Simulation Generator</a> that&#39;s perfectly suited to rescue an innocent mini from that situation while still collecting charges.<br><br>3. A name misspelled consistently may indicate a character replacement rather than a mini.<br><br>4. The writer may not consider the misspelling important enough compared to other aspects of the badfic to remark on at all.<br><br>That all goes for your &quot;example,&quot; too. There isn&#39;t a mission to it yet, and it will be up to whoever tackles it (if anyone does) to decide how to handle it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

She and her daughter were sitting in the door of the TARDIS, legs dangling over the void. “I can’t imagine why you’d ever want to come down.”<br><br>“Well, sometimes, the cultures on the different planets are even more interesting than the views,” the Aviator said, smiling. “The cuisine’s not half bad, either.”</i><br><br>Eh, what&#39;s the view to an empty stomach? Oh right, space and time traveling spaceship. Also, Dawwww.<br><br><i>“Barcelona!” Mr. Dives called, looking up from the TARDIS console, which he and Zeb had been poring over. “The planet, Barcelona, not the city. They’ve got—”</i><br><br>Wise decision, between the independantists and salty World Cup los–<br><br><i>“Dogs with no noses,” he and his daughter finished in unison.</i><br><br>Abort! Abort! It has to be worst place in the multiverse! Except trollfics.<br><br><i>The Aviator waved a hand. “I’m in mostly good standing with Upstairs again; I can’t let it stay that way for long, can I?”</i><br><br>Besides you can fix this by giving them buckets of aphids. These critters love flowers to the death, so the reverse must be true, right?<br><br><i>“Nobody!” the Aviator said quickly, just as Zeb piped up, “That’s what Ellie calls the Detective!”</i><br><br>Technically Ave&#39;s not wrong. The fex drops of that time certainly don&#39;t qualify as somebody.<br><br><i>“Have you been seeing someone?” Mr. Dives said.<br></i><br><br>&quot;How do I give the shotgun talk to someone able to regenerate?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dad! I&#39;m 454 years old! I can date whoever I want! If I was ever dating someone, just deny– saying.&quot;<br><br><i>“Nothing to worry about, Dad, that just means we’ve got a mission,” she said, standing up and going back to the controls.</i><br><br>Stay here, Mr. Dives, you know you want it... Right until you see one mission up close.<br><br><i>“So what do you think it’ll be this time?” Zeb said. “Percy Jackson? Twilight? A Series of Unfortunate Events?”</i><br><br>Since you&#39;re so kindly asking... All of them (does that even exist?)<br><br><i>The Aviator took Elanor back from him and pushed the door of the TARDIS open, going to the console to read the report. “Harry Potter and Percy Jackson,” she called.</i><br><br>Come on IO, only one? You&#39;re getting meeker in your old age.<br><br><i>“So not even an attempt at an explanation for why she wants a kid,” Zeb said in disbelief. “Just—‘Hey, you know what? I want babies for no reason!’”</i><br><br>How can people write like this with straight faces?<br><br><i>“Or gotten splashed by a magic potion—”</i><br><br>Especially that one. Even mortals can do it. With magic (and maybe science someday. They&#39;re already trying for babies from parents of the same se anyways).<br><br><i>“I volunteer as tribute,” Zeb whispered in Zeus’ voice, and the Aviator gagged.<br></i><br><br>...Accurate Zeus is accurate, Zeb.<br><br><i>“Godmother?” the Aviator muttered. “So, what, she’s going to attend the Sue’s baptism and teach her about Jesus?”</i><br><br>Nah, I saw this in Shin Megami Tensei. By being obedient servile mooks to the Law God (a major jackass), they hope getting some perks while the rest of the ‘pagan’ gods become scorned demons.<br><br><i>“Could you try breathing away from me?” she said. “Your breath stinks.”</i><br><br>You should try grilled salmon with a cream sauce. Much better.<br><br><i>“Lilith. Juno. Olympia. Black,” the Aviator repeated flatly, pen poised over her notebook.</i><br><br>… At least the oh so subtle third one remotely looks like a Potterverse pureblood name, with all these constellations (not that Sirius would probably want to use one)?<br><br><i>The Aviator ducked back behind the curtain. “Rassilon’s saggy left—”<br></i><br><br>As another ‘question sane people never ask’... What happens to that curse if Rassilon regenerates a body of the different sex?<br><br><i>the plants</i><br><br>How are these plants… managing to do <i>that</i>? Where are the necessary organs?<br><br><i>The Aviator just groaned and added the charge. “What I wouldn’t give for a ...ing drink right now.” Zeb frowned at her, and she held up her hands. “Hypothetically, I swear.”</i><br><br>Okay, a fan of alcohol, I’m most definitely not, but Zeb, one glass at that?<br><br><i>“Skipping over the gods fighting over babysitting privileges,”</i><br><br>Another clear sign of badfic... A good parody would have made you want to read that again and again… What? What is passing above my head exactly?<br><br><br><i>“I’m going to projectile vomit all over this sofa,” the Aviator muttered.<br></i><br><br>Aim it at the enemy!<br><br><i>“Suddenly Elanor doesn’t seem so creepy by comparison,” Zeb said.<br><br>The Aviator slowly turned to look at him. “‘Scuse me?”</i><br><br>Emergency, need save!<br><br><i></i><br>“Yes,” the Aviator said, pursing her lips. “She is, thanks.”<br><br>Save found. Now fire the guy at Impulse Control.<br><br><i>“Projectile vomiting on Voldemort?” Zeb suggested.<br></i><br><br>See? That’s a viable tactic.<br><br><i>The Aviator grunted. “Then we’d get to charge for excessive angst instead of… hell, how do you even charge for this? Spoiled rotten prisoner?”</i><br><br>Duck it, the second one needs to be a charge in the list.<br><br><i>“Hitting her for everything she’s got, huh?” Zeb asked, opening a portal to their next destination.<br></i><br><br>Zeb, is there anything about this critter worth inspiring any shred of mercy?<br><br><i>Zeb looked over to see the Aviator’s eye beginning to twitch. “You know,” he said, “as far as songs go, it could be worse—”</i><br><br>Joe Dassin ?<br><br><i>“You know, too much of the same color leaves an outfit visually uninteresting,” Zeb said, shaking his head in disappointment. “Especially with her hair like it is—analogous colors are fine and all, but since her hair is blue and purple, she’d probably want to go for a split-complementary color scheme. Throw some red in there, make it pop!”</i><br><br>Where did a Pokemon pick up tips about human fashion? And how much does he charge? What? At least next time the characters will have nice outfits.<br><br><i>“You know, this still doesn’t make sense no matter how much I think about it,” Zeb said, rearranging his dress robes before sitting cross-legged on his chair. “Dumbledore wants her to be kept a secret so bad he never lets her leave her room, but then he invites her to sing in front of the school, but then he tells her as soon as she’s done she has to go right back to her room and… what, they’ll just hope everyone forgets about her?”</i><br><br>Remember, nobody cares about dumb facts and logic, Zeb. Only one-upping Harry.<br><br><br><i>The Aviator stood up, taking Zeb’s earmuffs from him when he offered them to her. “Let’s get that guitar,” she said as the Hall burst into applause. “Dee—er.” She cleared her throat when Zeb looked at her with a slow grin. “The Detective’s got an amp in his TARDIS—I mean, this is an acoustic, but he might still find a use for it.”</i><br><br>… Any chances of Elanor getting a sibling in the more or less close future y chance?<br><br><i>“Ave and the Detective, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S—”</i><br><br>PG level of discyourwebapps forbids me of pointing out the other four letters word fitting there… What? Do you have any idea how muh of a can of worms ‘love’ can be?<br><br><i>“Rock, Paper, Scissors?” Zeb suggested.<br></i><br><br>Lizard and Spock clearly missing there.<br><br> <i>Zeb squinted at the notebook. “Ave, I can’t read Gallifreyan!” he called to her. “You gotta stop switching midway!”</i><br><br><s>Shamelessly stealing</s>Respectfully borrowing the idea for Richard someday.<br><br><i>The Sue burst into a shower of glitter, coating the Aviator’s hands in sparkles. She recoiled in disgust and began shaking her hands as the tracker on her ankle began beeping alarmingly. “Shut up, it’s the Sue, you piece of *bleep*—” She delivered a vicious kick to the tracker with her other foot and it fell silent after one last, mournful beep. </i><br><br>That ducking piece of crap is still there, seriously?Just go to the Great Workshop in the Sky, dang it!<br><br><i>“Man, why can’t all our missions be this easy?”</i><br><br>*Looking at iximaz&#39;s mission count* It&#39;s all your fault Zeb.

Should it go for a daughter or a son?<br><br><br>Again, Dawww for the start. And the mission presented the badfic well, with a nice and clean dispatch.

            <p>Well, it has two canons I recognise, a team I&#39;m at least vaguely familiar with, and is only (&#39;only&#39;) 14 pages... I guess that means I should read it. ;)<br><br>The opening scene is really cute. I clearly have something of a soft spot for domestic scenes (says the person who has written multiple stories about his retired agents and their kids...), and this works really well. (Though... I guess Zeb is... human now? I&#39;ve clearly missed a lot. You have a thing for literally transforming your characters, don&#39;t you?)<br><br>... oh my gods, Artemis, Zeus, what. &lt;&lt;&lt; The fact that this comes across so clearly shows that you&#39;ve selected your quotes well. It also doesn&#39;t come across as overly-quoted, which is always a good thing.<br><br>For the mission itself, I&#39;d say it felt about the right length - you hit the high points (well, low points), and didn&#39;t overcharge (the art of presenting a charge list that people won&#39;t just skip over is a tricky one to learn). I&#39;d personally make my badfic quotes shorter than yours are, but I think that&#39;s in the range of style and preference; it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re MSTing, is the main thing.<br><br>So yeah: good stuff. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Zeb&#39;s not permanently human, he was just using the disguise generator for this story.

            <p>The pink floor-thing was really tugging on Anne’s mop. Its suction seemed to increase the more she pulled back on it and soon the mop’s handle was beginning to creak and she was feeling it right back in her joints. Her arms were beginning to feel disturbingly disconnected from her torso. She hrrrm-ed to herself for a while until she saw small cracks begin to spider around the floor. This struck her as somewhat not good. <br><br>‘Hey, Bingle?’ She glanced around the corridor. It was still. There was an eerie silence, except for the squelching, stretching sounds of the pink floor-things. <br><br>‘Hey, Finch?’ She glanced around again. An air conditioner hummed. The lights beamed. It was graveyard-silent. Somewhere in the distance a wolf howled. <br><br>She released the mop and in a blinding flurry of movements that went <i>SNAP! CLACK! SQUORRSH!</i> the mop was totally absorbed into the pink floor-thing. Anne was pretty sure she heard something like chewing, as she walked down the corridor, around the corner, to Ninetwo. <br><br>Ninetwo was in the exact same situation Anne had been in. She was quivering and tugging and exhaling until Anne said: ‘Hey, hrrm, Ninetwo-’ at which point she yelped, hopped away, and watched as the pink floor-thing ate her mop. <br><br><i>Umm! Anne! Hello!</i> And she saluted, trying to ignore the crunching snaps of the mop behind her. <br><br>‘Have you seen Bingle?’ <br><br><i>Umm?</i> <br><br>‘Have you seen Finch?’<br><br><i>Umm?</i> <br><br>‘Well?’ <br><br>Ninetwo rubbed her seedclock. <i>Oh, um,  no, they’ve been gone for a while. They disappeared hours ago.</i> <br><br>‘You didn’t tell anyone?’ asked Anne with a raised eyebrow. <br><br>Ninetwo was immediately on the defensive. <i>They - they almost always disappear! Nearly every shift, the both of them go completely AWOL and only reappear when the shift is over! I would suggest that it’s the both of them dodging their duties but that would be rude of me and against the principles of the PPC, so I won’t!</i> <br><br>‘Huh,’ said Anne. ‘Okay.’ And she shrugged and walked off for a new mop. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>‘Oh, just you wait, Finch,’ Bingle said, rattling in his chains. ‘They’ll be here any moment. Just you wait.’ <br><br>‘<b>Sure.</b>’ <br><br>‘With the Security Dandelions in tow, and perhaps even an assassin or two as backup!’ <br><br>‘<b>I bloody well bet.</b>’ <br><br>‘Oh, believe me this,’ Bingle said, gazing, hardfaced, into the blackness of the cell they were sharing. ‘They <i>will</i> be here, any moment now. Any second. Just you wait.’ </p>

            <p>Talia peeked her head into RC65536+3i &quot;Erm, hello?&quot;<br><br>Thoth looked up from his perusal of <i>Renegades of Pern</i>. &quot;Ah. Talia. What seems to be the issue?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was looking for Tom, actually. Said he&#39;d keep me company on shift, and then never showed. So, have seen him, big guy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have not, since...&quot; Thoth frowned. &quot;Three days ago. Most unusual.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Odd...&quot; said Talia, rubbing her forehead in thought. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could use some magical to track him down or something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could. But I see no sense in doing so. He will appear. I am sure of it. In any case, I have my studies to attend to.&quot; He put his head back into the book.<br><br>Talia promptly turned and banged her head on the wall. It wasn&#39;t actually a <i>hard</i> bang, just one for comedic effect. &quot;So... let me get this straight. We have a simple, easy way to locate your missing partner, but you won&#39;t do it because you&#39;re too lazy, and you think he&#39;ll turn up on his own in a place like HQ. Instead, you&#39;re reading second-rate 80&#39;s fantasy in an attempt to get a grumpy alcoholic with emotional problems to like you.&quot;<br><br>Thoth turned a page. &quot;Believe what you will.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well... THAT&#39;S STUPID!&quot;<br><br>At that precise moment, Tom staggered through the door. His eyes were bloodshot, his hair mussed, and his clothes looked like they had seen three days without a wash (which they had). He promptly collapsed into his chair/improvised bed. Thoth didn&#39;t bother looking up.<br><br>&quot;Tom?&quot; Talia asked, concerned. &quot;What the heck happened to you? Are you alright? Why didn&#39;t you join me on shift? What could have done this?&quot;<br><br>Tom grinned tiredly. &quot;It...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come on, say it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was...&quot;<br><br>&quot;...You&#39;re really doing this. Really. Just so we&#39;re clear, if you say anything about soap, I&#39;m going to murder you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was... d-d-<i>Dark</i>... <i>Souls</i>...&quot;<br><br>RC65536+3i seemed to grow quiet for a moment. And then...<br><br>&quot;SERIOUSLY?&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Thoth continued to read, relatively unperturbed.</p>

            <p>Always fun to see characters who don&#39;t usually interact get a chance to do so.<br><br>&quot;a grumpy alcoholic with emotional problems&quot; - Yeah, that&#39;s roughly accurate. {= ) I don&#39;t think he&#39;s <i>quite</i> an alcoholic, but it was clearly just a matter of time had circumstances not intervened. (And circumstances were always planned to intervene, just not the ones that got there first.)<br><br>I think Talia&#39;s &quot;What could have done this?&quot; is a little overdramatic, but having just now checked out the soap reference, I guess it&#39;s part of the shtick. I&#39;m not sure Talia was in on it at that point, though? I mean, she was actually worried about Tom; I wouldn&#39;t expect her to start joking around until she was sure he was okay. (Though I&#39;m with Thoth that going missing for a few days in HQ isn&#39;t really as worrisome as one might think; these things happen.)<br><br>And if she WAS in on it then, she&#39;d have only herself to blame if he did claim it was soap poisoning. Which is what I&#39;d suggest to make the joke a little easier to pick up on: &quot;If you claim it was soap poisoning, I&#39;m going to murder you.&quot;<br><br>Cuz. Uh. I wouldn&#39;t have gotten it anyway, but at least it would&#39;ve stopped my brain from reaching for the usual places oblique mentions of soap point to. &gt;.&lt;<br><br>Noticed a couple missing words:<br><br>- &quot;So, have [you] seen him, big guy?&quot;<br><br>- &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could use some magical [trick/ability/power/...] to track him down or something?&quot;<br><br>Video games are a helluva drug. {; P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll confess, Talia&#39;s line was a tad overdramatic. I now recall a tiny voice telling me something like that when I was writing this.<br><br>I should listen to that tiny voice more often. It might be the voice of sanity and reason.<br><br>No, the correct line from here would have been more along the lines of &quot;What the heck was it that got you like this?&quot; or perhaps, &quot;What the hell were you doing, I had to sit alone on shift, do you have any idea how boring that is?&quot; Or something.<br><br>Ah well.

            <p>Overall, neat, funny scene, I think it does a good job of showing off people&#39;s characters (though mainly Thoth&#39;s independent/&quot;Tom can handle himself, I&#39;ve got my own thing going&quot; strain).<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what the soap line was supposed to mean though.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>As for Pern being fifth-rate... Isn&#39;t fith-rate the bottom, usually? I think we need somewhere to put all the nonsense we can&#39;t remember because it was so bland below Pern. And somewhere to put Xanth and Gor below that... Besides, I like Pern, so through the power of Willful Delusion, I can say it&#39;s first rate. :-P</p>

            <p>Yeah, I forgot to put these in the main post. So... well, yeah. Tom goes missing to play a video game. Not really surprising, I figured it was the reason that would make the most sense. <br><br>Fun fact: The original idea for this prompt was an elaborate parody (read: theft) of the &quot;Airline Pilots&quot; sketch from the Proto-Monty-Python British TV special <i>How To Irritate People</i> (Which, notably, also contained the &quot;Job Interview&quot; sketch which would go on to feature on Python proper, the &quot;Car Salesman&quot; sketch, which is the direct ancestor of the now-famous Parrot Sketch, and the introduction of the &quot;pepperpots,&quot; a Python mainstay). Why didn&#39;t I do this? Because I got bored, didn&#39;t want to write it, wasn&#39;t sure if it fit, wasn&#39;t sure if it was a good idea, and really was too busy playing Dark Souls.</p>

            <p>One day in the happy world of Headquarters, something very peculiar happened. Wobbles The Clown was missing! All the boys and girls and nonbinary life forms were very confused, because Wobbles made sure to tell all her friends if she was going away, and Wobbles was friends with everyone.<br><br>Everyone in the Nursery decided to go and look for Wobbles, because she might have gotten lost or fallen down a plothole, and that could be dangerous - or worse, boring. So off they went on an Adventure.<br><br>They looked in the Floating Hyacinth&#39;s office, but Wobbles wasn&#39;t there.<br><br>They looked in Wobbles The Clown&#39;s RC, but Wobbles wasn&#39;t there either.<br><br>They weren&#39;t allowed to look in Rudi&#39;s, but a friendly Security Dandelion did instead, and it said Wobbles wasn&#39;t there either.<br><br>They looked in the A/V Division offices, but the grown-ups there were not very friendly and screamed and threw things and one did a wee in his trousers, and worst of all Wobbles still wasn&#39;t there!<br><br>Where, oh where could Wobbles be?<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;I... I really appreciate you doing this for me.&quot; The Notary looked immaculate, and it was only when you got close by that you could see the age and tiredness in her eyes.<br><br>&quot;Ah-buh-buh-buh-buh! I&#39;m doing this <i>with</i> you. The hard work is all on you.&quot; Wobbles would normally have offered a hug, but the way the Notary was trembling meant she stayed a pace or two away.<br><br>&quot;I know, I know. I&#39;m just...&quot; The Notary sighed, quiet and old as an empty church. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br><br>Wobbles smiled and said nothing.<br><br>The door in front of them eventually opened, and a much shorter woman greeted the two and welcomed them into her office. In a few moments, it clicked shut, revealing a sign that said Nurse Jennifer Robinson, FicPsych.<br><br>The old Time Lord sat, and spoke, and when the tears and shaking and pain dragged themselves to the surface, Wobbles was there.<br><br>Right where she needed to be.</p>

            <p>So the Notary&#39;s had a lot of time to come to terms with help always being available in Headqwarts to those who ask for it. The growth&#39;s true for Wobbles as well - she&#39;s making much less of an effort to be HAPPYSMILESUPERFUNTIMEWHEE around the Notary and trying a lot harder to be her friend.

            <p>I like the children&#39;s book-like style in the first part. I&#39;ll note that it feels like a very appropriate style for a story about Wobbles (especially since, if you&#39;re reading for the first time, it looks like it&#39;ll be a rather comedic one).<br><br>And then the scene changes, and we have this rather serious (and heartwarming) emotional scene with the Notary and Wobbles. One think I liked about this section is that you did a good job of using the narration to convey the Notary&#39;s emotions.<br><br>(Minor note: the &quot;quiet and old as an empty church&quot; simile, while understandable, felt like it didn&#39;t quite make sense.)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>The shot was fired from behind. Point blank, from behind a cardboard box. In a flash of explosive light, the bullet left the chamber, piercing the cardboard, and approached Harrison&#39;s spine. In an instant, he vanished. The bullet might not have hit him, if it was any further away. But the bullet had vanished with him. The bullet hit, far away, in a dark safe room, somewhere miles away underground. Or maybe not. Harrison was gone, and so was the bullet. <br><br>It was written off as a failed mission. The target had gotten away. <br>Or maybe he wasn&#39;t lucky enough.<br><br>Two weeks pass. There were no more sightings of Harrison. No more tears in reality. No more extra hours of daylight, or unending night. No more. - <br><br><br>Or the bullet hadn&#39;t hit and he is merely biding his time. Maybe he is taking the chance to finally disappear. A fake death. A get out of jail free card.<br>A rare opportunity for a man like him. He should get what he deserves. <br><br>Another month passed. <br>He was only human, after all. Wasn&#39;t he? He seemed more machine than man. More animal than human. He was strong. Powerful. But a bullet can change all of that in an instant. <br>Harrison is presumed dead, succumbing to his injuries.<br><br>He was a force to be reckoned with. He defended many people. He helped many. But he harmed many, many more. He never showed his hand, and was trusted by nobody. He got what he deserved. <br><br>Harrison is dead. Whatever phenomena is occurring is not connected to him whatsoever. His house has fallen over a patch of farmland. Constant streams of ash pour out. A small amount of partially damaged golems currently roam, but will be contained and destroyed. Harrison is dead, and the dead have no hold over the living.<br><br>The golems began screeching at 9:04 pm, Tuesday evening. Simply bashing them with hammers wasn&#39;t enough. Attempts to move and contain them have failed. Harrison must have had batteries somewhere continuing their power. They will die soon enough. <br><br>After eight weeks, the golems have finally been silenced. Twenty ton deadweights; it was simpler to bury them than to move them. The house fire ceased, and was promptly demolished and shipped to a proper disposal site. An anticlimactic conclusion to the end of his tale. <br>And now, for some final words: Good riddance.</p>

            <p>I think I see what you&#39;re trying to do here, slowly building up the impression of the world (I guess?) that this guy is really gone while also leaving it eerily ambiguous. Even if he&#39;s dead, his legacy clearly lives on in some fashion. It&#39;s a cool idea.<br><br>I&#39;m thrown off by the tense changes and inconsistent paragraphing, though. Are those things deliberate? If so, I can&#39;t work out the meaning to them. Are you trying to show a meta effect of Harrison&#39;s ability to mess with reality? I&#39;m confused.<br><br>Also, some SPaG:<br><br>- &quot;approached&quot; is a very passive word for a speeding bullet and doesn&#39;t tell us how close it got.<br><br>- You want &quot;farther&quot; for physical distances; &quot;further&quot; is for everything else.<br><br>- Stray hyphen at the end of the fourth paragraph.<br><br>- &quot;phenomena&quot; is plural, so the phrase should be &quot;phenomena are ... are not connected&quot; or &quot;phenomenon is ... is not connected&quot;.<br><br>- &quot;amount&quot; is for uncountable measures. Golems are countable, so you want &quot;a small number&quot; of them. And, where are they roaming? The house? The farmland? Somewhere else?<br><br>- Were the golems silenced by an outside force, as the current phrasing implies, or did they just run out of juice and fall silent on their own?<br><br>- It sounds a bit like it&#39;s the fire that was demolished and shipped, since that&#39;s the subject of the first clause of that sentence. It could benefit from rephrasing to put the house in that role.<br><br>I think that&#39;s everything I noticed. Again, cool idea, and I think it could be very effective with some tweaking.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First off, thanks.<br>The tense changes were mainly to imply what time it was taking place in. The double line spacing between &quot;No more.-&quot; and &quot;Or the bullet&quot; was intentional, to separate it from the rest, and indicate a time shift. It shifts to the present tense, because it&#39;s when people are talking about it. Honestly, personal mistake not adding a second space between &quot;get what he deserves&quot; and &quot;Another month&quot;. <br><br>Re, SPaG:<br><br>I used approached for that very reason. We, as the reader, are not supposed to know if the bullet, say, is touching him, or if it&#39;s inches away. As a writer, I wanted that uncertainty.<br><br>Stray hyphen was intended to give the section preceding it sort of a &quot;reporty&quot; feel. Not super duper official, but still some inkling of it. <br><br>The golems might have simply been silenced by burying them. It&#39;s hard to hear screeching under 50 ft of dirt. Or maybe they were deactivated by someone. Lost power. Or maybe the small hammers just didn&#39;t work. so they had to use bigger ones.<br><br>Thanks for the help with the rest of the SPaG; and because I forgot to mention it earlier, partial credit to John Milton (yes, that Milton) for inspiring this writing style.</p>

            <p>Just as an example of why I can&#39;t make sense of it, you&#39;ve got two sentences about a transition in time. The first, &quot;Two weeks pass,&quot; is present-tense (and the rest of the paragraph is past). The second, &quot;Another month passed,&quot; is past-tense. It doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;re using consistent tenses for consistent sorts of thoughts, especially when you switch between tenses in the same paragraph, which happens a couple more times, in the two golem paragraphs.<br><br>And then, you addressed the instance of double whitespace between paragraphs four and five, but not the several instances of no whitespace, such as between paragraphs two and three. There should be one line of whitespace between paragraphs for standard Internet formatting.<br><br>I think perhaps it would be clearer to write the main narrative in Roman type and past-tense, with &quot;official reporty&quot; present-tense bits set off in italics, people&#39;s gossip in quotation marks, and standard paragraphing throughout. Right now, even with the explanation, I&#39;m still not sure which bits are supposed to be report, narrative, people talking, or what. {= (<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The two women were curled up in bed together, blankets drawn up over bare skin to keep away the chill. Charlotte draped an arm over Ix&#39;s waist, grinning.<br><br>&quot;So your full name is—?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Ix said, looking rather shamefaced.<br><br>&quot;I mean, I knew Potterverse werewolves&#39; names were a little on the nose, but—&quot;<br><br>Ix rolled over, grumbling when Charlotte&#39;s arms tightened, pulling her closer. &quot;You don&#39;t have to take the mickey out of it.&quot;<br><br>Charlotte rested her chin on Ix&#39;s shoulder, grinning. &quot;I&#39;m not teasing, I just think it&#39;s hilarious, that&#39;s all. Faolan Amaris—&#39;little wolf moon&#39;? Your old author really had it in for you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Weren&#39;t you named after a spider who wrote messages for a pig?&quot; Ix said, glancing over her shoulder at Charlotte.<br><br>Charlotte stuck her tongue out at her. &quot;Hey, it could be worse,&quot; she said. &quot;Lupin&#39;s dad&#39;s name also meant wolf, and his mom&#39;s maiden name was Howell, so...&quot; She trailed off when she noticed Ix&#39;s grimace. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My middle name, Amaris, was my ma&#39;s given name,&quot; Ix said. &quot;My da&#39;s name was Connell... which also means wolf.&quot;<br><br>Charlotte stared at her for a minute before letting go, guffawing loudly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t be laughing, but—&quot;<br><br>Ix waved a hand, smiling wryly. &quot;Wolf and Moon had a werewolf kid. It&#39;s alright, I&#39;d be laughing, too.&quot;</p>

            <p>I think this this a good job of describing how people are moving throughout the scene, and for a dialogue-heavy piece the lack of a setting is helpful for letting people focus on the important bits (the conversation and the snuggle session), I think.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>So this is...kind of non-PPC writing. Think of it as...backstory of sorts...for an AU version of a PPC agent and some other people??<br><br>Alright. Basically: Doctor Who and Torchwood Hogwarts AU, wherein Torchwood characters through season 2 and Doctor Who characters through New Who&#39;s season 4 exist in the Potterverse--in the 1970s. The Harry Potter characters remain in place. Where does the PPC agent come in? Well, instead of Jack Harkness, we have Jacques Bonnefoy. And yes, there is a difference. Also, here he was born in France and sounds it, though he put a lot of effort into a British accent during school and uses that frequently as well.<br><br>Around 1975 or 1976, Jacques Bonnefoy (French Hogwarts student, graduated two years back) and his best friend Ianto Jones (Welsh Hogwarts student, graduated one year back) stumbled into the PPC (present day). They became agents in different departments, with the idea that they would stay for a time and then go back to figure out some way to help once the war with Voldemort heated up further, which it seemed it was going to. Several years later, that&#39;s what they did: they went back, rented a flat together, and joined their friends in trying to help (though not within the Order of the Phoenix itself).<br><br>It&#39;s not the best atmosphere to be living in, for the obvious reason that there&#39;s a war on.<br><br>A key:<br><br>Jon (Jonathan) Smith: the Ninth Doctor. Of an age with Jacques.<br>Johnny (John) Smith: the Tenth Doctor. Two years older than Jon.<br>(it&#39;s a family name!)<br>Rose Tyler and Ianto Jones--same names as usual, even if their backstories are a bit different.<br><br><br>&quot;And you haven&#39;t seen him?&quot; Rose was frowning. &quot;I don&#39;t like this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe he&#39;s just...out.&quot; Jon&#39;s voice was light, but the crease between his eyebrows betrayed him. &quot;You know how he is--always liked his nights out--&quot;<br><br>Ianto shook his head. &quot;He was meant to be coming straight back. To the Muggle shops, to Diagon, and back. That&#39;s <i>it</i>.&quot; He stared down at his hands: useless. Completely useless. &quot;I should&#39;ve been with him.&quot;<br><br>Rose shook her head immediately, reaching out to take his hand. &quot;You couldn&#39;t have known.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s a war on,&quot; Ianto said. He pulled his hands away and stood, trying to resist the urge to pace. He ended up moving haltingly toward the kitchen and then turning back. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have let him go alone.&quot;<br><br>It had seemed so easy, yesterday. Jacques had been grinning, teasing him as he checked his pockets. He&#39;d at least seemed relaxed, switching in and out of French and daring Ianto to keep up until the younger wizard rolled his eyes and started speaking in Welsh--which he could do <i>far</i> too quickly for Jacques&#39; limited knowledge of the language to work.<br><br>&quot;Going to miss me?&quot; Jacques had asked, just before he left. He&#39;d sidled up close, eyes dancing.<br><br>Ianto had rolled his eyes. &quot;Not a bit.&quot;<br><br>Jacques gasped. &quot;So <i>cruel</i>! You know I think the world of you, <i>mon ami--mon cher ami, mon--</i>&quot;<br><br>Ianto shoved him, grinning. &quot;Just go to the shops already, you prat.&quot; He&#39;d marched Jacques to the door with a hand on his shoulder; there, the grin faded. &quot;Come back in one piece.&quot;<br><br>For a second--just one second--Jacques&#39; fingers had brushed his cheek. &quot;For you--I will.&quot;<br><br>He&#39;d been out the door before Ianto could catch his breath long enough to roll his eyes, jogging down the stairs with a cheery wave and a grin.<br><br>And then he hadn&#39;t come back. No word, no sign--nothing. He was just <i>gone</i>. Ianto had already checked for him in several places, had even sent an urgent letter to his parents in case for some reason he&#39;d got it into his head to go to France. Nothing had worked.<br><br>Sending a note to Rose and Jon had seemed like a good idea at the time. He&#39;d been pretty sure they were around, for a change--both were working for the Order of the Phoenix, had tried to get him and Jacques to join as well--and, well, if Jacques wasn&#39;t with them, then...they might have a better sense of where he could be.<br><br>&quot;I <i>really</i> don&#39;t like this,&quot; Rose said quietly. She looked up at Jon, nervously twisting the thin gold ring on her left hand; he looked back more seriously now, his ringless hands shoved deep into his pockets. &quot;We&#39;re gonna look for him, right?&quot;<br><br>Jon nodded. &quot;&#39;Course. Can&#39;t just let him vanish.&quot; His eyes flicked to Ianto. &quot;We&#39;ll get him back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ianto said. He took a breath. &quot;I&#39;m coming with you. I should have--&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot; Jon stepped forward, shaking his head. &quot;Keep looking, but stay safe.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s my <i>best friend</i>. If you think I&#39;m going to--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you ever done anything like this before?&quot; Jon demanded. &quot;I bet you haven&#39;t. Rose and I&#39;ll go. We&#39;re a good team. We&#39;ll find him, and we&#39;ll drag him out of whatever mess he&#39;s landed in. But you&#39;re going to be smart, and stay based right here, so there&#39;s someone to back him up if he gets out on his own and comes back with company.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or injured, you mean.&quot; Had the walls here always been so, so <i>shabby</i>? He&#39;d thought it was a nice enough place, or at least bearable, but right now it just looked dull and pointless. They should have found something better, maybe in a different city--maybe then Jacques wouldn&#39;t have-- &quot;You want me out the way and here in case by some miracle he--&quot;<br><br>&quot;I want you staying safe,&quot; Jon said sharply. He ran a hand over his hair, a habit he&#39;d picked up from Jacques, who&#39;d picked it up from someone else in turn--Hart, possibly, and wasn&#39;t <i>that</i> an unsettling thought. Whatever the two of them had been throughout school, it wasn&#39;t friends. &quot;Can I be frank?&quot;<br><br>Ianto jerked his head. &quot;Can&#39;t stop you.&quot;<br><br>Jon met his eyes. His gaze was the sort of intense that almost made sense of how strongly Jacques had been drawn to him in fifth year--almost. Ianto could never completely see the appeal, even if he respected what he did--and, worse, what he was in another universe. &quot;If he comes back to find you&#39;ve got yourself killed, he&#39;ll go spare.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If he comes back and got himself killed, <i>I&#39;ll</i> go spare,&quot; Ianto retorted.<br><br>Jon grinned; Ianto narrowed his eyes. &quot;You&#39;re a right pair, you are. Look, me&#39;n Rose--we&#39;ll get him back. Whatever condition he&#39;s in when we find him, we&#39;ll get him back. You stay here. Keep writing to people, keep checking places he might&#39;ve gone in the Muggle world--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Couldn&#39;t Rose--?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll be busy,&quot; Rose said. She motioned to Jon. &quot;Someone&#39;s got to keep him talkin&#39; sense.&quot;<br><br>Ianto ran a hand through his hair, wishing for at least the twentieth time that he hadn&#39;t picked up the habit himself. &quot;Right.&quot; Send the pureblood around to make house calls in the Muggle world--or, worse, telephone calls. No way for that to go poorly. &quot;If you&#39;re not back in two days--&quot;<br><br>Jon shook his head. &quot;Give us a week.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A <i>week</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A week,&quot; Jon said firmly. &quot;Hope we won&#39;t need it. A full week before you do something stupid, though.&quot;<br><br>Ianto crossed his arms, realizing too late he&#39;d picked <i>that</i> up from Jacques as well. Was there <i>anything</i> in his life that hadn&#39;t been influenced by him by now? They&#39;d only even been proper friends since Ianto&#39;s fifth year...which was admittedly quite a while ago, now. &quot;I never do anything stupid.&quot;<br><br>Jon snorted. &quot;Nice try, mate--knew you in school.&quot; He clapped Ianto on the shoulder and then looked over at Rose. &quot;We should go! Get our things in order, figure out a place to start--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rose said. She came over to kiss Ianto&#39;s cheek. &quot;Be safe, yeah? We&#39;ll bring him back.&quot;<br><br>Ianto nodded. &quot;Maybe the pair of you should become Aurors, when the war&#39;s over.&quot;<br><br>Rose grinned. &quot;Nah--when the war&#39;s done, I&#39;m taking Johnny and moving as far away as I can get. Not like he won&#39;t have found somewhere interesting by now, all the traveling he&#39;s been doing...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Best be off,&quot; Jon said. He was already moving for the door; Ianto had the impression that he couldn&#39;t wait any longer to start looking, and was suddenly, fiercely glad of it. &quot;Rose--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot; She joined him, and smiled gently at Ianto as Jon opened the door. &quot;We will find him.&quot;<br><br>Ianto nodded. &quot;I&#39;m sure you will. Take care.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>For the curious, a (brief, incomplete) Hogwarts House key:<br><br>Gryffindor:<br>Gwen Cooper (a year below the Marauders)<br>Jacques Bonnefoy (three years above the Marauders)<br>Rose Tyler (half a year younger than Jacques by my notes)<br>Possibly Kevin (Jacques&#39; year, still needs a surname--this is the translation of Jack&#39;s childhood friend who he...talked into joining a war with him and got, in short, killed. In this universe, he was killed by Death Eaters in the year before Jacques and Ianto joined the PPC).<br>Martha Jones (a year above Jacques)<br>Donna Noble (same year)<br><br>Hufflepuff:<br>Ianto Jones (a year below Jacques)<br>No one else from DW/TW, apparently. Weird.<br><br>Ravenclaw:<br>Owen Harper (Ianto&#39;s year)<br>Toshiko Sato (I have yet to figure out what year)<br>Johnny Smith (aka Ten, two years above Jacques)<br><br>Slytherin:<br>John Hart (tell me you&#39;re surprised. Look me in the eyes and tell me this is a surprise to you. I&#39;ll wait.)<br>Jon Smith (aka Nine. Went there primarily because he asked out of curiosity, and regretted it as Voldemort rose higher and the blood politics really got going. In fifth year, he loudly insulted his housemates over it in the Great Hall, and ended up with detention--and, after serving detention with Jacques (who definitely didn&#39;t get detention for this exact purpose), a new friend.)<br><br><br>Also: Suzie Costello is around somewhere, possibly not at Hogwarts at all, John Hart--well, we&#39;ll leave him for another time, and of course the Master&#39;s around--his name is Harry Saxon (though he&#39;d really rather people called him Harold), and he&#39;s Johnny&#39;s sworn academic rival. They have quite a bit of fun, even if they disagree a bit when it comes to morals. In research.<br><br>Also also: where&#39;s everyone from Classic Who? They&#39;re around! Never fear. They&#39;re just a bit older! The Smith family is incredibly full of them, though they&#39;re definitely not all brothers. Presumably, all the companions are around as well. I do have a tentative description of how the Smiths are all related, but apart from that, I&#39;ll just leave you with the tidbit that the Three and Delgado Master equivalents are old friends of the inexhaustibly bantering type. That Master is quite likely Saxon&#39;s uncle (or father?) and Johnny and Harry probably met a few times growing up.<br><br>(Also also also: why, yes, this universe&#39;s Ten and Rose have gotten married. Yes, this is, in some ways, a happy AU. Yes, in other ways it might possibly be worse than canon. And yes, I <i>did</i> have a lot of fun creating this!)<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>It was Franklin who made the call.<br><br>&quot;Ianto,&quot; he said when the younger wizard picked up. &quot;Good. Faster than an owl, this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sir?&quot; Ianto had been preparing to leave, had just been going to get a last healing potion, but a call from this man...<br><br>&quot;Jacques is in St. Mungo&#39;s,&quot; Franklin said.<br><br>Ianto sat on the sofa&#39;s arm with a thud. &quot;He--&quot;<br><br>&quot;They don&#39;t know yet,&quot; Jacques&#39; father said. Now Ianto understood the rough quality to his voice. He&#39;d been thinking vaguely of phone quality before, wondering if cellphones could really be any better. &quot;His--your--other friends, Jon, Rose--they&#39;re in with him.&quot;<br><br>Ianto dropped the phone. He sat frozen for a moment before he managed to get off the sofa and pick the receiver back up. &quot;I--&quot; His voice was barely audible.<br><br>&quot;How soon can you get here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Minutes,&quot; Ianto said blankly. &quot;I was--going already. To check--&quot; To check down at Jacques&#39; favorite Muggle club. One last time, before he accepted that the week was up and he was going to chase his friends into Death Eater territory.<br><br>To accept that he was probably going to try to contact John Hart.<br><br>&quot;Fourth floor,&quot; Franklin said. Ianto finally noticed how much thicker his accent was than normal: an old oddity, Scottish-tinged words to his wife and sons&#39; French. Odder, really, was his surname, taken to match his wife&#39;s-- &quot;Be careful on the way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br><br>Franklin hung up. It was a testament to the situation, probably, that he hadn&#39;t repeated his habitual insistence that Ianto could always use his given name now he was nearly five years out of school.<br><br>Ianto allowed himself half a minute to sit and feel his hands shaking. Then he got up, gathered his things and some of Jacques&#39;, and forced as much calm into his body as he could before he Apparated to the alley closest to St. Mungo&#39;s.<br><br>Try as he might, however, he could do nothing to calm his mind.<br><br><br><br>--<br>Yes, there will be more! But this seemed like a, ahem, fun place to cut it. <s>I never get to do cliffhangers anymore.<s><br><br>Jack&#39;s father was also named Franklin; his mother&#39;s never named, though we see her briefly. In this AU, both of them are alive, and the mother is named Amélie. That he&#39;s Scottish is both to explain the name and in slight reference to Jack&#39;s actor, John Barrowman, actually being Scottish for all he uses the American accent in most of his performing roles. Jacques having developed a British accent while at Hogwarts is also partly in reference to Barrowman&#39;s American accent, though it was partly just a survival tactic.<br><br>Also, have some dates! This is set in late 1979 or early 1980, which means that the war is about two years away from ending. Jacques graduated in 1974, Ianto in 1975; around 1976 they ended up in the PPC, where they spent one to two years. This places them back in their version of the Potterverse around 1978 (or possibly late 1977).<br><br>~Z</s></s></p>

            <p>The fourth floor of St. Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries was for spell damage. First was creature injuries, fifth held a tearoom and shop that Ianto had no intention of visiting. Third--ground, second, and third didn&#39;t matter, but the information catalogued its way into Ianto&#39;s mind anyway: artifact incidents on the ground floor, magical bugs on the second, potion and plant poisoning on the third.<br><br>Jacques was paler than Ianto had ever seen him, almost paler than the crisp hospital bedding he was lying on. His eyes were closed. He was breathing, just unevenly enough to be noticeable; when he&#39;d been brought in--when someone had left him in the lobby--he&#39;d been unconscious and had bruises on his back. The rest of the damage had been invisible.<br><br>He hadn&#39;t woken up. Nearly a day, and he hadn&#39;t woken up.<br><br>Ianto had hardly ever seen Grey before, and he barely saw him now. Jacques&#39; younger brother spent most of his time in the tearoom that Ianto was avoiding; when he did show up, after Ianto had sat helplessly for an hour, he stood looking at Jacques for ten minutes, looking nearly as pale, and then left again.<br><br>Franklin was there, though, and Amélie; Amélie even hugged him, clinging for long moments before she smoothed his hair and let him go. It was Franklin who caught him up in short, pained sentences, who told him that the Healers seemed worried that Jacques wasn&#39;t waking up, who pointed him to Rose, lying pale and still and scratched just below her neck nearby. Who explained that the scratches were from some sort of animal, but the Healers had been far more concerned with the spell damage, and had given her sleeping potions so that she could heal faster.<br><br>Because Rose was expected to heal, and soon. She was young, and healthy, and looked worse off than she was. She would be fine.<br><br>Ianto sat with her anyway, when he felt he&#39;d start screaming at Jacques to move if he looked at his friend any longer. Her breathing was smooth, even; pale and still as she was, he could believe she would bounce back.<br><br>Jacques was still motionless in an hour, and in another hour, and another. The sad little bag of Jacques&#39; belongings that Ianto had brought sat nearby, out of the way. It seemed now incredibly, stupidly optimistic that he&#39;d believed Jacques might be in any condition to appreciate the thought, much less actually use anything he&#39;d packed. Stupid, idiotic--<br><br>Medical. What if Medical could heal him? What if Medical could heal him where St. Mungo&#39;s couldn&#39;t, and sitting here waiting was going to--<br><br>But if Jacques was <i>supposed</i> to die--well, Ianto wouldn&#39;t let him, and that was that. But if the author of their AU decided to kill him off--<br><br>No. No, they couldn&#39;t. That couldn&#39;t happen. No. Because--because they were an AU, and Jack Harkness was immortal. He&#39;d found so many parallels when he made his way through the story: Jon, Johnny, and Rose, Martha&#39;s interest in healing, Johnny&#39;s traveling, hell, even the rivalry between Johnny and young Harold Saxon. The Doctors were all relatives, Owen Harper in Ravenclaw was dating someone named Katie, Jacques had even dated a girl called Lucia--surely, with details that small in place, the author wouldn&#39;t write in Jacques&#39; death? It wouldn&#39;t make sense. The change would be too large.<br><br>Franklin shifted in the chair next to him, sending Ianto&#39;s thoughts back into turmoil. Franklin was alive; that was already a change. But Jacques was also French, not from a nonexistent colony planet, so--<br><br>Round and round. He had to--<br><br>Jacques was unchanged. Grey was back, sending desperately awkward glances at Ianto as his mother hugged him. Ianto decided it was time to go see Jon.<br><br>&quot;First floor,&quot; Franklin had told him earlier. He&#39;d added that it didn&#39;t look good, but Jacques...Ianto hadn&#39;t been able to shake the hope that he would wake up any minute, the fear that it would happen the second he stepped away.<br><br>Now he took the risk, walking out the door and taking the lift down. It took nearly ten guilty minutes to find Jon, which he finally managed after catching a Healer who was willing to spare a minute to talk.<br><br>He wished he hadn&#39;t. He really did. He&#39;d never seen anyone injured like this, outside of that one awful badfic he refused to think about, and he&#39;d never wanted to, either.<br><br>Jon wasn&#39;t the familiar shade of pale he&#39;d seen on Jacques and Rose: he was chalk white. Every big of visible skin was broken, deep slashes that made Rose&#39;s scratches look like they hadn&#39;t broken the skin. There was--there was a bite mark at his neck. Ianto thought wildly of sparklepires when he realized it looked human--but no, this wasn&#39;t that kind of crossover. He <i>knew</i> it wasn&#39;t.<br><br>The bite at Jon&#39;s neck was uncovered, angry and red but not bleeding; the healer who gave him a very quick run-down of Jon&#39;s injuries mentioned a second one under the bandage on his arm, and slashes...slashes everywhere.<br><br>Ianto swallowed again and again after the Healer left. Finally, he went into the next room and threw up.<br><br>When he came back, Jon was unchanged. Ianto dragged over a chair and sat, forcing himself to look at the other wizard. He felt ill, still--but what was that compared to <i>this</i>?<br><br>What had even <i>done</i> this? The Healer seemed to have assumed he knew what had happened, if not the specific injuries, which left him to play detective at just about the last time he&#39;d ever want to. Slashes, so deep--human bite marks, of all things--and the Healers couldn&#39;t just close it all up, said his chances were bad--<br><br>He froze as it came to him, staring down at Jon&#39;s limp hand against the blanket. No. <i>No.</i><br><br>He got to his feet, feeling like he was floating. Tucked the blankets in around Jon, made for the door, went back up to the fourth floor. Jacques was unchanged; Rose was still asleep. He told the Bonnefoys that he had somewhere to be, but would be back, tomorrow if not tonight; they wished him well, thanked him for coming at all--and then he was back in the lift, out in the street, ducking into the alley, Apparating home. Closing the blinds, taking out the remote activator--<br><br>His hands didn&#39;t shake as they punched in coordinates. He hesitated a moment before stepping through the bright blue portal--what if--?<br><br>He had to know. He had to <i>try</i>...and he couldn&#39;t do that from home.<br><br>He stepped through. The portal closed behind him.<br><br>--<br><br>((More to come! ~Z))</p>

            <p>Glad you think so.<br><br>I just love that at the root of it all is Hart--John Hart. In Torchwood, he&#39;s Jack&#39;s Time Agent ex-partner; here, he&#39;s the Slytherin boy who took exception to Jacques probably as early as the train to Hogwarts, and kept up a banter-filled rivalry of the sort where they literally fought each other for all seven years, each fancied the other at some point, and had some weird kind of trust between them that most people weren&#39;t really aware of because it was mostly shown in moments hidden here and there.<br><br>And that&#39;s the guy who Ianto thinks passed the trait on to Jacques, who passed it on to his own friends in turn. Can&#39;t be the most pleasant feeling in the world, that.<br><br>And hurray, Rose feels like Rose! They&#39;re all meant to (feel like themselves, that is), in a way--the idea is really just &#39;okay, translate everyone into the Potterverse in the seventies.&#39; So, you know, Gwen Cooper spent a whole lot of years trying (and failing) to rein in the Marauders, which is a bit of a callback both to her personality in general and to her time on the police force. On the show, she also has a boyfriend named Rhys. He doesn&#39;t know what Torchwood does--he thinks she works for special ops. Here, he&#39;s a Muggle; she meets him over the summer holidays in her last few years at Hogwarts, and falls for him. Things like that--believe me, I can go on, and on, and on...and that&#39;s how I got such a developed AU to begin with. I just kept on thinking of how to carry things over.<br><br>As to Rose in the PPC...well, I can&#39;t so much see her deciding to stay, but I <i>can</i> see her visiting. To the point where I now have in my head the first couple lines of a scene for it. So that might happen at some point.<br><br>In the meantime, as I mentioned above, expect a little sequel to the scene pretty soon. I had the first couple lines come into my head this morning, and ended up writing out two notebook pages&#39; worth of it soon after. Now I just need to type it up and finish it...<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Ce’rana of Borune smiled slightly as she finished drying her face, hanging the washcloth back on its little ring. It always was nice to be clean again, even if it was only some parts of her.<br><br>This time, however, she did not immediately turn and exit the bathroom. She took a moment to turn to the set of hanging shelves next to the sink; something towards the back had been bothering her in its nonidentifiability since she’d noticed it. Given the lack of dust, it was obviously either new or frequently-used, and she really saw no harm in keeping up with the various things her partner used.<br><br>Her eyebrows raised slowly when she picked up the black tube and read the label. Wordlessly, she stepped out of the bathroom and walked over to Alex’s half of the RC, extending it to him when she reached him. “Alex? May I ask what this is?”<br><br>He glanced at the tube for an instant, then paled slightly and looked back at the book he was reading. “Never seen it before in my life.”<br><br>Ce’rana blinked. Now <i>that</i> was an unusual reaction. “Are you certain? Because whatever this is, it is certainly not mine, and if it is also not yours then someone else must have been in our bathroom very recently.”<br><br>“That could be it, you know.” He shrugged, quickly turning his attention to his book in the vain hope that she would drop the subject.<br><br>The Dryad thought for a moment. He obviously recognized it, and just as obviously didn’t think that she knew exactly what the term ‘Hair Dye’ meant. She leaned down slightly and smiled, raising the tube slightly so she could compare it to his hair without him necessarily noticing. “Alex, are you entirely certain this is not yours?” she asked sweetly.<br><br>“I’m positive it’s not mine.” He didn’t look up, hoping that if he ignored the tube long enough, it would go away.<br><br>The tiny agent straightened again. “In that case, I will be holding onto it to ensure that it is not lost before it can be returned to its owner.” She bit her tongue for a moment to avoid spoiling her game. “I trust this will not be an issue?”<br><br>“You could just put it back… please?” He glanced up at her again, still hoping that she would drop the subject.<br><br>Ce’rana blinked. That wasn’t his usual tone for when she was bothering him about something. “Is it something expensive, then? I would think it would be better to keep it somewhere safe in a case like that,” she said a moment later, struggling to keep up her ruse of cluelessness.<br><br>“If you put it back, then whoever owns that will know where it is.” He was running out of excuses.<br><br>“Yes, but it might fall and be lost, given where it was.” The Dryad had to bite her tongue again to keep from just saying what came to mind next. “And if this individual will be continuing to leave things around, perhaps we ought to speak with one another and set aside a space to be leaving said things so they do not get mixed in with ours, as this did.”<br><br>“Rana… just put it back.” He really wanted to stop this conversation before it got worse. “I’m sure that it would be fine where it was.”<br><br>Ce’rana couldn’t keep her smile from growing wider. “I will if you tell me why this color matches the majority of your hair so well, Alex,” she said innocently.<br><br>His book closed. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”<br><br>She leaned down again and tapped his nose with the tube. “I may have never personally touched it, but many of the ladies at court were perfectly willing to change the color of their hair to match some fashion or another. As a result, I do know what the term ‘hair dye’ means, and even if I did not, I do know what dye is. The shade of black indicated by this container matches your hair almost perfectly - likely a minute difference between this and the dye itself. So, I repeat my question: why is it that this matches your own hair so well, Alex?”<br><br>“It doesn’t match my hair, see? I’ve got a brown streak.” He grabbed the offending streak of hair and held it out to show her.<br><br>Ce’rana raised her eyebrow at him. “Historically speaking, one of the more common fashions to recur was to have most of a woman’s hair be black, but have a single white streak left in it. Your argument proves nothing to me.”<br><br>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”<br><br>“It would be entirely plausible for you to dye every bit of your hair save for one streak, or to dye just that streak. However, seeing as I know you hate that streak, my closest guess would be that you have been attempting to cover it with dye.”<br><br>“I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.” He sounded less like he didn’t know, and more like he was just wishing she would buy it.<br><br>She tapped him with the tube again. “None whatsoever? Assuming I would believe this, whom is it that would have left this on our shelves among your things?”<br><br>“I will literally pay you to stop talking about this.” He pulled out a bar of chocolate.<br><br>Ce’rana immediately dropped the tube into his lap, took the chocolate, and walked back to her side of the room. No Tolnedran could resist the allure of the word ‘pay’, and no Dryad would resist so much chocolate for something so simple.<br><br>Alex gave a small sigh of relief, then picked up the tube and took it back to the bathroom. Ce’rana heard the sound of a sink turning on and chuckled to herself as she broke one of the little pieces off the bar. Even if she hadn’t gotten him to admit it, she’d still gotten all the answers she’d wanted and more.</p>

            <p><b>Daily Life Over at The Wake</b><br><br>As part of one of the few routines he had been able to grasp in the past three months, Bobo found himself just outside of the Southern District&#39;s humble Welcome House, staring into the mid-distance, waiting. The sky was calm, the trees and grasses hummed softly with Life... and Nita had no idea he was here.<br><br>Well, in the bigger scheme of things, she knew he was <i>here,</i> in the City of Change, and he knew that she knew, and in some small way that put him at ease. Nita had become a constant - or, from another point of view, had become a constant <i>again</i> - and to a potentially-disquieting extent he was loathe to change that- <br><br><i>&quot;&#39;Stihó!&quot;</i>, came the greeting, and the <i>other,</i> newer constant, came into view. Only months&#39; worth of practice allowed the Umbreon-embodied peridexis to suppress his groan.<br><br><i>/Dai, Nautilus,/</i> he returned, breaking off his attempt at meditation to properly greet the embodied Aeon-slash-City.<br><br><i>/A Vaporeon, again? Haven&#39;t you grown tired of that form?/</i><br><br>Nautilus - for he <i>had</i> taken on the shape of a Vaporeon this time, possibly so they&#39;d be more equal in height, merely shook his head and grinned.<br><br><i>&quot;Like how you would ever tire of getting to spend time with Nita?&quot;</i><br><br>That line drove Bobo to fix the other with a <i>Look.</i><br><br><i>/You&#39;re here to train me, not tease me,/</i> he strained, walking over to Nautilus&#39; side stiffly.<br><br><i>&quot;And I&#39;m not free to do both?&quot;</i> Without prompting, Nautilus reached out and lightly pawed one of Bobo&#39;s ears; a quick bout of reflexes brought them <i>out</i> of the &quot;Vaporeon&quot;&#39;s physical reach.<br><br><i>/There&#39;s more than one kind of freedom- and our time here</i> is<i> limited, whether you like it or not. What style are we in today?/</i> he asked, in a rush to change the subject, because time was limited whether <i>he</i> liked it or not as well.<br><br>Not because he&#39;d mentioned Nita. Not at all.<br><br><i>&quot;Well, I</i> was<i> going to make it card dueling, again, but-&quot;</i> Nautilus jumped in the air, and didn&#39;t quite make it all the way back to the ground.<br><br><i>&quot;Race you to the clouds?&quot;</i><br><br>Bobo smirked. <i>/I know you like being flashy, but I&#39;ll admit this sounds novel. You&#39;re on./</i><br><br>Not wanting to waste time, he focused on his <i>own</i> set of invisible stairs, and pounced.</p>

            <p>But the last sentence of that paragraph seems a bit disjointed. The word &quot;estimation&quot; carries a bit of a logistical connotation, and one would use it for things that has a quantity attached to it. What you used it for however is something that has no inherent amount; one can&#39;t have varying degrees of artisan, whereas one can have varying degrees of artistic ability. Perhaps a better word might be &quot;impression&quot; or &quot;judgement&quot; instead.</p>

            <p>I mean, when you&#39;re trying to talk about all of something, you have a few options as far as words to use, but all of them basically serve the same purpose as &quot;all&quot; and would be just as potentially problematic.<br><br>A lot of the time (not always, mind) you can just drop the &quot;all&quot; entirely. You could say &quot;she stripped it of his lovely potions&quot; and &quot;all&quot; is, to some degree, implied. However, if you want to emphasize that all of something is involved, then you really have no choice but to use a word like &quot;all&quot; or &quot;every&quot;.<br><br>Personally, I think that this is just one of those cases where an editing system gets it wrong. They&#39;re very useful tools, up to a point, but they have their limits and should always be augmented with a solid understanding of grammar and the meanings and connotations of words. Just the other day, my autocorrect tried to get me to say &quot;the place were the boy stood&quot; instead of &quot;the place <i>where</i> the boy stood&quot;. I still <i>use</i> it; it&#39;s caught something I missed plenty of times. But I don&#39;t accept everything it says as fact.<br><br>It&#39;s good that you&#39;re watching out for these things, but I don&#39;t think &quot;all&quot; is a problem word.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve heard of &quot;all&quot; being a word to avoid before, but thinking how I&#39;d write the sentence differently, perhaps you can be more descriptive with it. Replace &quot;all his lovely potions&quot; with &quot;every glittering vial and philter&quot; or some such.<br><br>IMO, the issue you&#39;d really be fixing isn&#39;t with &quot;all,&quot; but with &quot;lovely.&quot; (I HAVE heard that adverbs are often not your friends.)

            <p>Wouldn&#39;t &quot;every&quot; serve the same function in the sentence as &quot;all&quot; and therefore be just as bad, from a certain point of view?

            <p>So, it was with great eagerness that I sat down with the very latest Dresden Files... collection of short stories (DANG IT JIM WHERE IS PEACE TALKS?). Then I stood up a hours later or so, because I&#39;d finished it. Jeez. I go through these things like tissue paper sometimes.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m not going over whether you should buy it, because if you&#39;re a Dresden fan, it&#39;s a forgone conclusion, and if you&#39;re not, then you should go out and read the first three books to see if you&#39;ll become one. Because Dresden is Good.<br><br>For my TL;DR: It&#39;s good, but not as good as Side Jobs. That&#39;s probably just because Side Jobs had the single best Dresden short ever. You are welcome to guess which one that is, and you&#39;ll probably get it in one, because it&#39;s Just The Best, and that&#39;s obvious. But this is still good. Read it.<br><br>Basically, I&#39;m going through the book story by story and giving my opinions. Added bonus, I&#39;ll try to make the whole thing as spoiler-free as possible (note from future me: I couldn&#39;t pull this off, everything from &quot;Bombshells&quot; onwards has spoilers. If you want to talk about spoiler stuff when you give opinions or whatever (and please do that thing, because yes), here&#39;s a spoiler block:<br><br>The spoilers were on fire, and it wasn&#39;t my fault. The spoilers were on fire, and it wasn&#39;t my fault. The spoilers were on fire, and it wasn&#39;t my fault. The spoilers were on fire, and it wasn&#39;t my fault.

The spoilers were on fire, and it wasn&#39;t my fault. The spoilers were on fire, and it wasn&#39;t my fault. <br><br>Right, let&#39;s get this show on the road.<br><br>&quot;A Fistful of Warlocks&quot; - Yawn. Evil warlocks, necromancers, awesome fights... we&#39;ve seen it all before. Maybe not from Lucio&#39;s perspective in the Old West, but still... this wasn&#39;t exactly the best note to open on IMO, because... pretty dull. By Dresden standards.<br><br>&quot;B is for Bigfoot&quot; - Now see, this is the story they should have started with. Yetis, classic Dresden investigation, and some Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide references for good measure. Then again, maybe it&#39;s just because I can empathize with Irving. I wasn&#39;t that kid, exactly. But I can certainly understand some of what he was going through. Also, if you wanted to know about Harry&#39;s dealings with Yetis after <i>Skin Game</i>... well. Here ya go.<br><br>&quot;AAAA Wizardry&quot; - It was okay. Not great, but... okay. Competant. Strong ending, all that jazz. But it&#39;s missing something...<br><br>&quot;I was a Teenage Bigfoot&quot; - And here&#39;s a story not missing that thing, whatever it is. Man, I really love this Bigfoot trilogy. It&#39;s fantastic. And this one has a punchline. Danged funny one at that. <br><br>&quot;Curses&quot; - Harry gets hired to lift The Billy Goat Curse, allowing the Cubs to once again win a World Series. It goes as well as you&#39;d expect, although the actual <i>reasons</i> why it goes that way will probably surprise you. It certainly made me laugh a lot. Nothing funnier than a goat.<br><br>&quot;Even Hand&quot; - Ever wondered what goes on behind Marcone&#39;s eyes? This here&#39;s for you. Not great, really, but rock-solid, enjoyable, and interesting.<br><br>&quot;Bigfoot on Campus&quot; - The conclusion of the Bigfoot trilogy. It&#39;s good, just like all the others. I thought I found a plothole in this one, turns out I was wrong. But it does deliver a few good laughs, and definitely made me feel some things as well. So that was nice. Also, it&#39;s basically &quot;How I wound up in the middle of a wrecked building/orgy in the middle of a college campus, by Harry Dresden.&quot; Which is hilarious, as is all the skepticism he gets from the guy he&#39;s telling the story to.<br><br>...and at this point, I&#39;ve realized that I actually can&#39;t talk about these next few stories without spoiling some stuff. So beyond this point, I assume you&#39;ve read up to <i>Skin Game</i>. You have been warned. Sorry about this.<br><br>&quot;Bombshells&quot; - This is how Molly got her deal with the Svartalves from <i>Cold Days</i>. We get to see some post-<i>Ghost Stories</i> Molly, which is cool. And... well. Dark. Molly is scary at this point. But even through all that, we get some laughs. From Andi, Thomas, Butters, and Molly herself. Mostly Thomas. That ending... jeez.<br><br>&quot;Cold Case&quot; - Okay, so after that last story, I thought this anthology couldn&#39;t get any more grim. <br><br>I stand corrected.<br><br>This is post-<i>Cold Days</i> Molly. And it&#39;s terrifying. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m scared for her, of her, or with her. Possibly all three. Everything about this story was harrowing, terrifying, and heartbreaking. And we get Cthulhu in the mix. Because in a terrifying and awful story that is as or more Grimdark than anything GW has ever put out, <i>that</i> was what we needed.<br><br>Um. At least we got to see some Ramirez? He <i>is</i> pretty attractive, or so I hear...<br><br>&quot;Jury Duty&quot; - Yeah, we needed a breather after that last one. Thanks, Jim.<br><br>This story is exactly what you think it: post-<i>Changes</i> Dresden gets called up for jury duty. Yes, this is exactly as hilarious as you think it is. No, it doesn&#39;t get old. Yes, it is more complicated than that. Yes, we get to see Will again, and that&#39;s pretty great. Just... read it. It makes me smile, in the way that is so very Dresden.<br><br>&quot;Day One&quot; - We get to see Waldo! WAAAALDO!<br><br>Also, it&#39;s post-<i>Skin Game</i>. So yeah. Great, fascinating, and... well, I&#39;m not gonna deny it, it&#39;s absolutely hilarious. There&#39;s nothing for comedy quite like someone seeing The Call To Do The Will Of The Allmighty as a WoW quest icon. And somehow, it gets better. There is nothing more to be said about this one.<br><br>&quot;Zoo Day&quot; - This one&#39;s in competition for all-time favorite Dresden short. Okay, there is no competition, because one of them blatantly stands head and shoulders above the rest. But this one&#39;s close, just like &quot;Aftermath&quot; was in the last volume.<br><br>Harry takes Maggie to the zoo. Which... well, if your hard didn&#39;t just melt, stop reading this, because you&#39;ve probably stumbled into the spoiler section by accident. :-P<br><br>Anyways, we get the story from three perspectives. Harry, who is... Harry, Maggie, who gives us valuable insight in how horrifyingly nightmarish being a child in the Dresdenverse actually is, and Mouse. Man, why don&#39;t we get more stories from his perspective? Mouse is great. He&#39;s like... uh... something really great. Like a giant magical dog or something. Anyways, each perspective gives us progressively more insight into what&#39;s going on, which is a style of storytelling I really like. Also, I think &quot;Baglered&quot; might become a permanant part of my vocabulary. We&#39;ll see.</p>

            <p>... is it possible to perhaps recruit &quot;original&quot; characters from bootleg or ripoff games? I mean, most of these games, especially on the App Store, are just little one-off things that are only designed to get their creators money, which makes their characters kinda similar to background characters in fanfiction.<br><br>&quot;Bootleg&quot; in this case means a game that entirely or very closely replicates the name and/or content of a continuum unlawfully, without being a fangame or parody. By that I mean I&#39;m trying to cover stuff as simple as this:<br><br><a href="https://apkpure.com/cup-hand-adventure/com.CupHandAdventure"><a href="https://apkpure.com/cup-hand-adventure/com.CupHandAdventure">https://apkpure.com/cup-hand-adventure/com.CupHandAdventure</a></a><br><br>and stuff as complex as this:<br><br><a href="https://www.vg247.com/2017/06/06/meet-hero-mission-a-blatant-chinese-overwatch-knockoff/"><a href="https://www.vg247.com/2017/06/06/meet-hero-mission-a-blatant-chinese-overwatch-knockoff/">https://www.vg247.com/2017/06/06/meet-hero-mission-a-blatant-chinese-overwatch-knockoff/</a></a><br><br>The only exception for these characters would be if fans of the original continuum &quot;adopt&quot; a character from the ripoff as an honorary addition to the cast, as is the case with Clark from the Overwatch ripoff &quot;Heroes of Warfare&quot;, dubbed &quot;Clark Shimada&quot; and considered McCree and Hanzo&#39;s son by Overwatch fans (at least, the ones who ship McHanzo.)<br><br>I&#39;d really love to see the sorts of character arcs that could come from a ripoff character: maybe wondering why they exist or wishing they didn&#39;t, maybe feeling abandoned by their cash-grab creators, maybe seeking to define themselves as a separate person from the character they&#39;re blatantly based on and overall trying to find out who exactly they are. If their game is particularly badly coded, they might be able to &quot;glitch&quot; things into happening.<br><br>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I think it depends on how far the bootleg tries to stray from the source material- with the rule of thumb I&#39;m going to give being thus.<br><br>&quot;Is this game trying to *become part of* the source material, or *copy* the source material?&quot;<br><br>For instance, if a Pokemon bootleg were labeled &quot;Slap Ball Monster Pocket Go&quot; and tried to sell itself as a clone of a Pokemon game, I wouldn&#39;t think of that as trying to usurp the canon of the game- it&#39;s merely copying from it. That isn&#39;t going to harm the canon in any way.<br><br>However, if a Pokemon bootleg were labeled &quot;Pokemon Pirepearl Alpha Rite&quot;, and at least made a passing attempt to place itself in the same world as Pokemon (say, having at least a few prominent canon Pokemon in the game) then yes, I would consider it a &quot;fan&quot;fic-esque entity trying to assert its influence on the canon- and *then* the original characters (say, fakemon) could be recruited. (Note that for Pokemon in particular, 3rd-gen bootleg games of this nature were usually hackroms put on a cart and sold without the consent of Nintendo OR the hack-maker. And hackroms typically <i>are</i> pretty much fanfics in video game format.)</p>

            <p>(Note: I probably should&#39;ve been saying &quot;ripoff&quot; instead of &quot;bootleg&quot;)<br><br>1. I think I get what you mean about not harming the canon, but what does that say about being able to recruit clones? The clone may technically be its own universe, yes, but because of copyright, it technically also shouldn&#39;t exist. Technically, the &quot;canons&quot; are still &quot;canons&quot;, but canons from good universes have been recruited in rare cases, and the fact that the original universe is a copy and is also hopefully doomed to be destroyed by the creators of the ripoff-ee makes recruiting seem a lot more justifiable.<br><br>2. I get what you mean about rom-hacks, but it feels really uncomfortable that you&#39;re grouping awesome rom-hacks and mods together with terrible ripoffs like &quot;Cup Haed Adventure.&quot; In particular, you seem to have severely downplayed the motives of all such games. The game is not trying to &quot;become part of&quot; the source material; that, from my perspective, would mean it&#39;s legitimately trying to add to the canon, which includes both good and bad rom-hacks. What the &quot;developers&quot; of said games, and thus the games, are trying to do is make a quick buck by pretending to be the canon universe so they can take advantage of both the canon universe&#39;s perceived popularity and the multitude of gullible children and their equally gullible parents who download freely on the App Store and Android Market. It&#39;s just money. Nothing but money. <br><br>However, if I were to use something similar to how you describe the motives of other games, I could say it was trying to pretend to be part of the source material. Not become part of, not copy, but pretend to be part of.<br><br>How do I know that the game shares the &quot;developer&#39;s&quot; motive? Well, most of these ripoff games are filled to the brim with ads. Sometimes the &quot;developers&quot; use even shadier techniques to get your money, such as asking you to let the game have access to your personal info (IE: CREDIT CARD INFO. <i>Now</i> is your mind changed?) If the game itself doesn&#39;t also want to make money, why does it have these things in it?<br><br>TL;DR: I guess I do see your point, but it just doesn&#39;t feel right to be treating unholy ripoffs and legitimate original universes the same way because of little technicalities. As I said, the name of the game for the &quot;developers&quot; is making a quick buck from people&#39;s lack of ability to discern what&#39;s official or a genuine fangame and what&#39;s not, so from my perspective, they don&#39;t fit into the categories that you gave. As for recruiting, I don&#39;t see why any of this prevents the &quot;canons&quot; of a ripoff game from being recruited. Heck, they might even flock to the PPC, assuming that they know they could be made to cease to exist at any time. Or something.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Well... pre-PPC art, anyway. A few weeks ago, I decided to sit down and draw what Constance Sims&#39; childhood would have looked like:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iyvZ6mV.jpg"><br><br>(<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/huinesoron/art/The-Childhood-of-Constance-Sims-750546778">On deviantArt</a>)<br><br>Hey, her Dad&#39;s an author, and she&#39;s a future PPC agent; of course she reads his books as he&#39;s writing them!<br><br>There&#39;s lots of fiddly details that I put in to amuse myself/fill space, for example:<br><br>-Constance has taken her socks off and dumped them on the floor; kids!<br>-She&#39;s also left a half-eaten bar of chocolate on the windowledge (probably not a good idea).<br>-With typical childhood lack of thinking, she is indeed drawing half-on the rug... despite the rest of the room being a wooden floor.<br>-The lamp by the window is actually mine.<br>-The rectangular photo on the shelf was taken in front of the trees outside the window (you can juuuust about make them out).<br>-I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the strongbox, but it&#39;s a fair bet a) Joseph doesn&#39;t want Constance to get at it, and b) she&#39;s had a look anyway (probably by climbing on her stool plus a pile of books).<br><br>I&#39;ve not done any other PPC drawings recently, but I have another recent piece (<i>Batman</i> fanart) up on dA, plus a couple more things coming... uh, when I get round to scanning and uploading them. ^_^ <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/huinesoron/gallery/">It&#39;s all over here</a>.<br><br>This would be an ideal place for any other artistic types to post their own recent works, PPC or otherwise... ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I really like the little details, it really gives personality to the scene instead of it being just another room. All of the lines also converge to the appropriate vanishing point, so that is good as well. However, Constance seems to be falling over, mainly because her left hand seems to be missing when it should be holding up her upper body. <br><br>Anyways, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uOw9br5.jpg">here</a> is mine. NSFW if a shirtless guy counts.</p>

            <p>I like the concept, but I’m not happy with the execution. This head is too small, or the hermit is too tall (not sure whether he’s also too broad). And he should stand more in front of the shelter, leaving space for a speech bubble to the right of his head.<br><br>HG<br></p>

            <p>I love all the little details in your picture. It feels like every time I look at it, I find something new about it. :) Now I kind of want to see a family portrait with her, Dafydd, and the kids...<br><br>As for my own art, I think I might have shared this before?

            <p>I like the use of the (I assume) flat pattern for the shirt - with the shading, it really works.<br><br>In fact, shading is something I want to particularly highlight - particularly on the first and last D&amp;D images, you&#39;ve managed to convey the lighting of the scene (the priest&#39;s eyes, the worgen lit from in front and below) very effectively. :)<br><br>hS</p>
