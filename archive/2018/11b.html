            <p>Yes, for once I&#39;m not just posting rambling pointless thoughts but an actual proper review of something. I mean, technically, I already sort of covered this in brief when I talked about <i>Unlimited Blade Works</i> and <i>Watchmen</i>, but I&#39;m gonna do it properly now.<br><br>Before we begin, I should note that I will try to spoil as little as humanly possible here, especially for <i>Unlimited Blade Works</i> and <i>Heaven&#39;s Feel<i>, which citizens of the board are more likely to care about spoilers for. I should also note that <i>this review is rated PG-13 for frank, non-graphic discussion of sex.</i> Now that we&#39;ve got that out of the way, I can start.<br><br>Fate, as most boarders are probably aware, is a property from Japan that is so sprawling and convoluted it could probably give Homestuck a run for its money. Okay, maybe it&#39;s not quite <i>that</i> bad, but the unofficial timeline uses the phrase &quot;Alternate Universe&quot; like most people use a comma, so that&#39;s the kind of thing we&#39;re getting into here. <br><br>What I&#39;m talking about today is the work that began it all: <i>Fate Stay/Night</i>, the 2004 visual. Not to be confused with the anime adaptation by Studio DEEN of the same name, or the anime adaptation by Studio Ufotable, <i>Fate Stay/Night: Unlimited Blade Works</i>, which adapts the second path through the visual novel... okay, I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. The point is, if you&#39;re thinking &quot;hey, I saw Fate, and that isn&#39;t what happened!&quot; it&#39;s possible the adaptation you watched diverged from the source material there. Then again, it&#39;s equally possible that I just forgot something or got something wrong: I&#39;ve been playing/reading this thing for months, and while I read through an LP to refresh my memory a bit, things still get a bit hazy sometimes.<br><br>So, I guess the first thing I should do is give a plot synopsis, or at least try to, because Fate is a proper visual novel, and thus a glorious mess of branching paths. In brief, however, Fate is the story of Shirou Emiya, a high school student living on his own after his adopted father passed away. Shirou was rescued by this father in the aftermath of a horrific accident in which his entire neighborhood burned to the ground, of which he was the only survivor, and idolized him greatly. To this end, he is attempting to follow in his father&#39;s footsteps by learning magic, despite his distinct lack of talent in the area. He aspires, one day, to become a superhero, or a &quot;hero of justice,&quot; to save everyone around him.<br><br>Through a series of remarkable accidents and coincidences, Shirou is drawn in as a participant in the Fifth Holy Grail War, a seven-way no-holds-barred battle to the death between seven mages, known as &quot;Masters.&quot; They fight using &quot;Servants,&quot; magical reincarnations of heroes of myth and legend, each cast into one of seven classes, with the aspects reflecting that class within them brought to the fore. The winner receives the Holy Grail, a magical artifact that is said to be able to grant any wish of whoever obtains it.<br><br>With his mysterious Servant, Saber, a female knight (who is really Xvat Neguhe—Yes, I&#39;m rot13ing that just in case, although anyone who&#39;s had contact with Fate probably already knows exactly who Saber is), Shirou endeavors to win the Holy Grail War, at the very least so that masters who may be entirely more sinister won&#39;t. Also he tries to... y&#39;know. Survive, despite being a pathetic weakling relative to everyone else in the war.<br><br>From here, the story branches in three different directions: The Fate route, which delves into Saber and her background; the Unlimited Blade Works route, which explores Shirou&#39;s classmate, fellow master and terrifyingly-powerful-mage Tohsaka Rin (Note: Rin is her first name. Yes, the translation I read, Shirou has his first name first and Rin has her last name first. Don&#39;t ask me why), as well as her even more mysterious servant, Archer; and the Heaven&#39;s Feel route, which is about Shirou&#39;s lifelong friend, Sakura and her family, the Matous.<br><br>I&#39;m going to tackle each route in turn, but before I do, I need to address the elephant in the room. You may have noticed that each route is defined by a girl. And... yeaaah... that&#39;s not a coincidence. Upon release, <i>Fate Stay/Night</i> was classified as an <i>eroge</i>: at least one defining part of each route, in this original incarnation, was which girl Shirou would have sex with. This isn&#39;t the version I played: in 2012, Fate was rereleased on PC as <i>Fate Stay/Night [Realta Nua]</i>, which is a port of the PS2 and PS Vita version with updated graphics, extra goodies, and with the sex scenes replaced with non-sexual alt scenes. This version is vastly, <i>vastly</i> superior, even if you&#39;re down with sex, and I&#39;d like to take a moment to talk about why.<br><br>Quite simply, the original game&#39;s sex scenes didn&#39;t add anything to the experience. In fact, in a lot of ways, they made it worse. They were shoddily written, poorly integrated, and it kinda generally felt like the team was thinking of contrived reasons to insert them that weakened the game&#39;s story. Maybe they were doing it so that the game would sell better. Maybe they felt like that was what was expected of visual novels. Maybe it was because it was their first commercial release, and the Doujin (fan/hobbyist) software scene is famously sexual. Either way, the sexual aspects of Type-Moon&#39;s work would continue to be like this until a few years down the line, when they finally realized that they didn&#39;t actually need to put sex in their VNs and stopped doing it. And There Was Much Rejoicing.<br><br>Even in their absence, the sex scenes still leave a scar on the series, and if you&#39;re wondering about a really dumb plot contrivance resulting in some weird imagery, it probably has something to do with that (DRAGON! Fate fans, you know what I&#39;m talking about). It also impacted the development of Fate in other ways: in the original draft, Shirou was girl and Saber was a guy (a very very handsome guy... but I digress), and at least one of them had a radically different personality, and the whole premise was fundamentally different in some rather dramatic ways. As awesome as a lot of that draft was (and I&#39;ve read the bits of it that were made public), Fate just wouldn&#39;t be the same without Shirou.<br><br>Anyways, let&#39;s just get down to the routes, shall we?<br><br><b>Fate Route</b><br><br>The Fate route in <i>Fate Stay/Night</i> is the first route you play. And while the author refuses to tell us which route is the &quot;right&quot; route, my money&#39;s on this one.<br><br>It chronicles Shirou&#39;s relationship with Saber, as master and servant, and as individuals. We&#39;re also introduced to the Holy Grail war and the cast and characters that we&#39;ll be playing with through the entire game, the magic system of Fate, and who Shirou is as a person. But I&#39;ll get more into <i>that bit</i> later, because first we have to talk about Saber.<br><br>Saber is... well, Saber&#39;s <i>cool</i>. A lot of people classify her as their Lust Object, and while that&#39;s not my stance, I can totally see why. She&#39;s a really interesting, well-developed character, an idealist with a heart of gold who would see thousands killed were it the best thing for those she protected. She&#39;s long since stopped even considering herself as properly human, because to be human is to be flawed—and in her eyes, she can&#39;t afford to be flawed. She has to embody her ideals, for the sake of all those she stands for.<br><br>The Fate Route is about Saber learning to come to terms with her humanity, with her flaws, even as Shirou comes to more and more admire and respect her (despite being a sexist idiot, but we&#39;ll get to that), and tries to force her away from the path she&#39;s going down. Partly because he sees her as tragic, which she kind of is, partly because Shirou distinctly has trouble seeing others in pain, at least those he&#39;s decided he cares about, and partly because he&#39;s totally crushing on her so freaking hard that it&#39;s kind of embarrassing. Eventually, she comes to sort of maybe reciprocate some kind of feelings maybe I don&#39;t know it&#39;s complicated and I read this a while ago don&#39;t judge me, although I doubt she&#39;s capable of really feeling the same way for him. And it&#39;s not like they had sex or anything (SHUT UP IT NEVER HAPPENED LALALALALA).<br><br>And yes, all of that is great: Fate&#39;s real strength has always been its characters, which are interesting and usually quite well-developed. However, that&#39;s not to say this route has no weaknesses. Firstly, there is just. So. Much. Exposition. This route bears the brunt of it for the entire VN, and it shows. The thing craws a little, and Fate&#39;s not exactly quickly paced at the best of times. The entire novel, in every route, is full of interludes for slice-of-life-style nonsense. Mostly extremely prolonged descriptions of Shirou cooking. I&#39;m serious! They should have called this thing <i>Fate Stay/Chef</i> and aired a cooking show based on it on the food network.<br><br>...Oh wait. There <i>is</i> a cooking anime based on it. It&#39;s called <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/todays-menu-for-the-emiya-family">Today&#39;s Menu for the Emiya Family</a> and I actually seriously recommend watching it after you&#39;ve played through, watched through, or read through all of Fate Stay/Night. It&#39;s really freaking adorable.<br><br>Anyways, the other problem is... well, the remaining sex scene scars. There are various quirks and oddities throughout the game because of it, and also Shirou kinda winds up in a Harem-comedy setup later on where he shares his house with three incredibly quirky girls, including Saber. Which is just... weird. Also Illyasviel von Einzbern, enemy master/friend depending on the route, is at turns cutesy and incredibly creepy in this route and in most others. She actually does have a kinda legitimate reason for this, in my opinion (as well as an incredibly strange upbringing), so I&#39;ll let it go, but it was definitely weird on my first playthrough. And of course, Shirou is a total sucker for women. Or girls. Or... well, really anyone. But especially women and girls.<br><br>All the same, I&#39;d say that the Fate route is overall extremely solid, and I definitely enjoyed my time with it.<br><br><b>Unlimited Blade Works Route</b><br><br>I hope you have enough swords.<br><br>Unlimited Blade Works is the route where I feel like Fate really comes into its own. It doesn&#39;t have the amazing development and story for Saber, true, but it has much, <i>much</i> more in the way of development for Shirou himself. This route is all about Shirou coming to terms with his ideals, with what he believes in, whether what he believes is right, and whether what he&#39;s doing is the right thing.<br><br>Shirou, you see, wants to be a hero. He wants to save <i>everyone</i>, and failing that, he wants to at least make everyone around him smile. He wants to be a Hero of Justice, to save the world, even if it&#39;s his life that&#39;s the price. Because he doesn&#39;t think his life matters. Ever since he almost died as a kid, he&#39;s seen himself as essentially living on borrowed time, and he&#39;s constantly haunted by that fire, which is what drives his ideal forward: He lived where so many died, and because he couldn&#39;t have saved them then, he has to save everyone now.<br><br>Honestly, despite all his objections to the way she behaves, he&#39;s a lot like Saber... I really think he&#39;s only objecting out of a case of &quot;you can&#39;t sacrifice yourself because I&#39;m already sacrificing myself.&quot; ^_^<br><br>Anyways, this is the route where Shirou is forced to confront his ideal, and more importantly to confront its flaws: Is it truly right to believe everyone&#39;s more valuable than you? Is this ideal really his? Is he simply a hypocrite? What do you do when you can&#39;t save everyone? How can you live with what you do then? And if the result may well be a life of pain and despair... is it still worth it?<br><br>This all circles the question that I think really lies at the core of Fate: What does it mean to be a hero? And of all the routes of Fate, I&#39;d say Unlimited Blade Works does the best job tackling that. And the blend of idealism and cynicism with which it does is exactly the sort of thing that makes me love Fate.<br><br>Of course, there&#39;s still a &quot;Romance,&quot; and I put that in quotes because it&#39;s really weak and stupid. While this route has you getting close to the magus Tohsaka Rin, and the dynamic between her and Shriou is pretty damn good, I just don&#39;t buy the way the romance is done here—because of course, it had to be written in a way that made the inevitable sex scene less creepy, and with that removed, it just doesn&#39;t have a reason to be the way it is. No, what would be better is if it eased off a bit in terms of the writing during the VN, but kept the ending, which hinted that the experiences the two had gone through together might lead to a relationship in the future. I find that a lot more plausible.<br><br>But frankly, I adore this route. It&#39;s just kind of awesome.<br><br><b>Heaven&#39;s Feel Route</b><br><br>And straight from my favorite route to my least favorite route. A lot of people love Heaven&#39;s Feel. One of those people is Gen Urobuchi, the author behind both the excellent <i>Fate/Zero</i>, a prequel which is arguably stronger than <i>Fate Stay/Night</i> itself, as well as the critically acclaimed animes <i>Psycho-Pass</i> and <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i>. Then again, Urobuchi loves nihilism, well-written characters suffering, and gore, and Heaven&#39;s Feel has the most of that of any of the Fate routes. So maybe that&#39;s not a surprise.<br><br>Anyways, I disagree. Heaven&#39;s Feel is a <i>mess</i>. It was stitched together from what was originally supposed to be two different routes, and I can definitely tell. The main focus here is supposed to be Shirou&#39;s friend Sakura, but oftentimes it feels like it&#39;s anything but, with Kirei Kotomine, the priest and war administrator getting a good chunk of the focus. Another focus magnet is Illya, who is much friendlier in this route.<br><br>But even if the focus wasn&#39;t on Sakura, I could forgive Heaven&#39;s Feel that if it told a good story. And I mean... it kinda does? What I will say is that it fills in a lot of exposition that explains what&#39;s going on in the other two routes and how it connects to the broader setting. And it&#39;s definitely interesting, and exciting. It kept my attention, and I enjoyed it.<br><br>But there are three fatal flaws in Heaven&#39;s Feel that really bring it all down, even if it&#39;s definitely enjoyable. <br><br>The first is character derailment. Shirou just... kinda stops being Shirou here. At least, the Shirou we&#39;ve come to know in all the other routes. He throws away his ideals. And after seeing how far he&#39;s willing to go for them, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m willing to believe that he&#39;d do that. Maybe the weakness was in him all along, and he&#39;d crack the moment that his ideals conflicted with the people he cared about. I can see that. But... well. Again, the way that it happened was just too sudden. It doesn&#39;t feel right to me. It&#39;s still definitely Shirou, but it doesn&#39;t feel right.<br><br>The second, far more unforgivable, flaw is the ending. Heaven&#39;s Feel&#39;s ending (really trying not to spoil anything here) is a Deus Ex Machina ending that feels out of step with the themes and general tone of the rest of the story. Given, there are two alternate endings that feel more appropriate, but still, the official, real, &quot;True&quot; ending is just... BAD.<br><br>But the final flaw is that so much of this route emphasizes the romance between Shirou and Sakura. And while there were romantic elements to the other routes, they weren&#39;t this prominent. And if you&#39;ll remember, the romance has always been pretty weak in this game. That doesn&#39;t stop now. We&#39;re focusing on the weakest element, and we get... well. We get kinda sexual, too, and not in a way that I think works all that well either. I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s discordant with the message, but it muddies the waters. And for once, it&#39;s pretty dang obvious that what&#39;s happening is a sex stand-in. I&#39;d go so far as to say that it&#39;s blatant.<br><br>Heaven&#39;s Feel could have probably been great. I won&#39;t say it&#39;s awful, but as it stands, it was rushed in development, and it&#39;s probably the weakest route of all of Fate, even if playing it is necessary to fully understand the story. I know a lot of peopl</i></i></p>

            <p><i>The Pelican Brief</i> was (to the best of memory) the first &quot;grown-up&quot; movie my parents took me to see when I was younger.  I barely remember it now, except for one character&#39;s death scene that stuck with me for some reason.  Now, the time has come to read the source material, both to correct my status of having seen the movie before reading the book and to restore canon knowledge to my fan brain.<br><br>Spoilers follow for the novel version of <i>The Pelican Brief</i>.<br><br><i>The Pelican Brief</i> is . . . fine.  Not great, not terrible.  Just okay.  My main issue with the story-line is that the only reason it maintains suspense for as long as it does is simply that Grisham doesn&#39;t allow the characters to talk about for a good chunk of the beginning—like, more than half the novel, I think.  On the one hand, this makes sense, as it avoids the &quot;as-you-know&quot; type of dialogue that we tend to hate around here.  But it left me feeling out-of-the-loop.  I&#39;m used to characters sharing the same level of knowledge that I do, by virtue of following alongside their perspective.  But in TPB, knowing that the characters had some huge clue that I didn&#39;t ruined the sense of suspense for me.  Rather than discovering clues alongside the principle actors, I was just . . . waiting for them to tell me.<br><br>A technical aspect that frustrated me is the way Grisham sometimes starts new scenes using pronouns for a paragraph or two before naming the character who&#39;s actually being followed by the action.  This mostly didn&#39;t matter when Darby was the focal character, since she comes very close to being the only named female character in the entire novel.  But when it starts out with &quot;he&quot; I had a big range of characters to wonder about.  The professor?  The journalist?  The FBI lawyer?  Another FBI person?  The president, or his prime lackey, or that prime lackey&#39;s lackeys?  The White House janitor or his policeman son?  Khamel or one of the other bad guys?  When your novel has so many characters, and nearly all of them are one sex, you don&#39;t get to open scenes with bare pronouns.  It&#39;s disorienting!<br><br>I&#39;m glad Grisham isn&#39;t reading this, because I&#39;m fairly short on positive things to say.  He does convey a strong sense of danger to Darby, thanks to him not being afraid to kill characters off violently.  I like Khamel the terrorist; he actually has one of the less stereotypically straightforward mindsets out of all the bad guys, and doesn&#39;t derive much pleasure from his assassinations.  It&#39;s just a job to him, and doesn&#39;t really bare any ill will towards his victims.  His killings are also memorable simply because of how brutally efficient they are.  Matiesse is an interesting example of taking a real world character way over the top and not having it seem cartoonish.  His wish to avoid contact with people outside of the staff he relies on, to the point where his living space is divided into places he can walk, and places everyone else can week, show how secluded his money has allowed him to become.  His thirst for wealth has driven him away from the very land he owns and wants to drill; he thinks he is above the rest of the world, but his plan still gets exposed by people in the society he tried to leave behind, and thanks to the initial efforts of a mere student.  It&#39;s good symbolism.<br><br>But a lot of the politically oriented characters are pretty baldly flat characters, only out to fuel the agenda of their political parties . . . which, okay, applause, he pretty much predicted the U.S. government through the 2010s, but that doesn&#39;t make for an interesting read.  I also super-duper don&#39;t like that Darby is apparently <i>into</i> older men, especially not with her having an affair with her professor when the novel opens.  Eeeeew.<br><br>Well, short review, but it didn&#39;t really live up to the hype for me.  What can I do?<br><br>—doctorlit is disappointed that not a single pelican appeared on-page.  The title implied pelicans would be present.  Zero out of ten, not enough pelicans, would not read again.<br><br>&quot;You get that pit bull off my [butt], keep him away from me, and I&#39;ll forget the pelican spoiler.&quot; &quot;You get that pit bull off my [butt], keep him away from me, and I&#39;ll forget the pelican spoiler.&quot; &quot;You get that pit bull off my [butt], keep him away from me, and I&#39;ll forget the pelican spoiler.&quot; </p>

            <p>Continuing the series of posts that could roughly be described as &quot;Thoth gives his thoughts on various stuff from the Fate-verse why is he still doing this nobody cares,&quot; I&#39;m talking about Volume 1 of a light novel nobody&#39;s heard of that I actually rather liked and would have liked quite a lot more if... well, I&#39;ll get to that soon enough.<br><br>If course, LEM2 had my attention pretty much from the word go. When I talked about Fate/Zero, I described Waver and his Servant by saying &quot;they actually ARE the best. I&#39;m not even kidding, it&#39;s not up for debate.&quot; So an entire series that shows Waver 10 years down the line and all grown up was always going to be of interest, seeing as he&#39;s one of my favorites. And then there&#39;s the fact that he adopts the role of a magical detective, a grumpy, inadequate Sherlock Holmes with a shy and awkward girl with some quite interesting talents serving as his Watson. I mean... come <i>on</i>! That is so much my thing that I&#39;d almost say this series was written specifically for me.<br><br>If not for the fact that it was never actually translated to English officially. I&#39;ve been reading an unofficial translation, and it is <i>terrible</i>. Just... awful. I mean, it <i>can</i> be read, but there&#39;s no sense of style, and the prose all-too-often feels awkward and stilted, which sometimes makes it hard. Then again, the anime/manga/etc community tends to value accuracy over style in their translations, which is something I can never quite forgive them for. Because it&#39;s a fundamentally <i>wrong</i> approach, as seen in the best translations, which are more concerned with keeping the spirit than the wordings.<br><br>Anyways, allow me to take a break from that rant to rant about something else: Type-Moon&#39;s localization policy. Or should I say, <i>lack</i> of one. Type-Moon is a company that is arguably ate the forefront of their industry, and their games are among the most recognizable Visual Novels worldwide. Sure, they don&#39;t have quite the same recognition as Phoenix Wright, but they&#39;re in roughly the same tier as Dangan Ronpa or 999, games that are markedly more western in their approach.<br><br>In my assessment, FS/N is probably the most traditional Japanese VN to get a real foothold in the west (Emphasis on Japanese: we have our own VN industry over here, although whether any of them have reached Fate&#39;s level of success is debatable as well), largely through word-of-mouth and its fantastic anime adaptations. And while that&#39;s not uncommon for VN-adapted-works, like CLANNAD and Steins;Gate, Fate is notable for its dedicated fanbase, many of whom have actually invested a tremendous amount of time into the source material.<br><br>So it&#39;s bewildering that in light of the fact that they have an army of international fans that will go to <i>frankly insane</i> lengths to get their hands on their work, even playing <i>entirely untranslated</i> versions of tie-in games, that Type-Moon continues to have little to no interest in international releases for their works. To date, not a single one of their Visual Novels has been officially translated, and it&#39;s only thanks to some brilliant work from MirrorMoon and Beast&#39;s Lair that we&#39;ve got translations that are as good as they are. Which is... honestly pretty good, most of the time, especially considering that the original works have an infamously quirky style that can even throw people in Japan for a loop.<br><br>The only reason we even got an international release of Fate/Grand Order, the free-to-play mobile spinoff (which is one of... maybe four spinoffs ever to be translated?) is because of a loud and repeated outcry from fans who had to fight <i>tooth and nail</i> to get what they wanted. And even then there are issues: f&#39;rinstance, in FGO, Artoria&#39;s name is rendered as &quot;Altria&quot;. Now, Artoria is an English name, a female version of &quot;Arthur&quot; because famously in Fate King Arthur is a girl. <i>Altria</i> is what happens when you take the Japanese version of the name (which is altered to account for Japanese phonetic rules, in much the same way that &quot;mele kalikimaka&quot; is as close to saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; as you can get in Hawaiian) and translating it literally <i>back</i> into English without Anglicizing it to reverse the original conversion. In short, it&#39;s a &quot;google translate&quot; translation: technically correct but ignoring the meaning.<br><br>What kind of professional translator would possibly make this mistake? Oh, they didn&#39;t. They knew full-well the proper way to translate the name, but Kinoko Nasu, the series&#39; original creator, actually <i>mandated</i> that they use the wrong translation.<br><br>So I think it&#39;s fair to say that Type-Moon just hates us English-speakers and wants us all to die without having experienced their works. <br><br>Anyways, I was supposed to be giving my thoughts on a work here... so let&#39;s get back to that.<br><br>In the 10 years since the events of Fate/Zero, Waver Velvet has become a charismatic eccentric. He&#39;s one of the Mages&#39; Associations&#39;s Twelve Lords, but largely through political dealings, as despite a keen intellect and an an ability to analyze and understand magecraft that is genuinely impressive (and makes him an excellent teacher at the Clock Tower) he&#39;s all-but utterly devoid of natural talent as a mage, having to resort to far more mundane techniques to get results. Remember that bit in Fate/Zero where he says a more talented mage could have used a far more intricate method to get their results than his primitive alchemy? Yeah, he&#39;s still very much doing that sort of thing. He&#39;s also, despite his outwards-facing charisma, a total mess in private. And yes, Fate/Zero fans, he still has his T-shirt.<br><br>Our protagonist is his assistant and apprentice, Grey, a shy girl who lived a strange and sheltered life before moving to London to become a student at the Clock Tower, and who has some quite remarkable abilities of her own (in fact, Waver makes a point of saying that if there&#39;s a fight between mages, he&#39;d be dead long before she hit the ground). She is, as I said, the Watson to Waver&#39;s (or should I say, Lord El-Melloi II&#39;s) Holmes, serving as an audience surrogate when the narrative needs an excuse to explain something to us, but she is an interesting character an in her own right and I genuinely want to learn more about her.<br><br>The story itself is... good. If it was translated better, it could even be great. Hell, I&#39;d say a real proper translation of this actually might work as a viable introduction to Fate for people who don&#39;t know the world. Sadly, that&#39;s not what we have, and it took an awful lot of my Fate background knowledge to make sense of some of the details of what was going on, although the broader plot was plenty accessible.<br><br>As for what the story was, Lord El-Melloi is sent off by his half-sister-sort-of (their relationship is complicated) to answer an invitation to a mysterious castle built by a mage obsessed with Angels. Said mage has just died; the invitation is to the reading of his will. Several other mages have been invited as well, and all of them are hungry for whatever he might have left behind: the mage was particularly well-known for his work in restoring magic crests that had been damaged or rotted due to age beyond the point where others would have deemed repair impossible. <br><br>What he did leave behind, it seems, was a puzzle, and whoever works it out gets whatever he&#39;s left for them all. The competition is between mages, so it&#39;s needless to say that it&#39;s cut-throat: mages are almost by-definition sociopathic when the need arises, especially when it comes to preserving their legacies. <br><br>Which is when the bodies start showing up.<br><br>So yeah, it&#39;s a pretty classic mystery setup (isolated location, multiple guests, everyone has a motive, increasing body-count), but it&#39;s pretty well-executed all the same, taking advantage of the unique aspects of the setting in ways that I honestly didn&#39;t expect. Waver, as a mage, is often more concerned with why a murder happened rather than how: with so much complicated magic being thrown around, the &quot;how&quot; is neither as meaningful nor as easy to discern as it might be in a traditional detective story. Sure it still matters, but it matters an awful lot less when your suspects have almost infinite methods at their disposal and powers that may well violate causality. And of course, alibis are almost entirely meaningless, because it&#39;s quite possible that everyone can kill from a distance. Arriving at who from why becomes easier, even in a cast packed with motives.<br><br>The atmosphere is also quite suitable. There&#39;s a distinct sense of gothic horror all about the book, as well as a lot of drawing on real-world mythology. That&#39;s suitable for Fate, which is a pretty cold and cynical setting when you get right down to it. <br><br>Anyways, in conclusion to this mess of weak, scrambled writing, Casefiles is pretty good, I just really hope we can get a better translation sometime soon. This is most likely to happen if Ufotable adapts it, so... please. Ufotable. I am begging you. Make this an anime.</p>

            <p>Yeah, this isn&#39;t a review. Unlike my thing below... my thoughts here aren&#39;t quite as collected. I finished watching <i>Fate/Zero</i> about... 5 minutes ago, although it <i>has</i> been a long time coming.<br><br>So this is me providing my thoughts as well as helpful answers to questions like &quot;what the heck is <i>Fate/Zero</i>&quot;, &quot;Should I watch it?&quot;, &quot;When should I watch it?&quot;, and &quot;Why does Fate/Zero put Heaven&#39;s Feel so far to shame that it&#39;s kind of amazing that anyone, even the author of Fate/Zero, still views it as positively as they do?&quot;<br><br>Okay, not that last one, it&#39;s just that Heaven&#39;s Feel is so bad and it could have been good and I can&#39;t let it go, but enough about my personal issues, let&#39;s talk anime.<br><br><i>Fate/Zero</i> was originally a light novel or a light novel series or something (I... don&#39;t exactly know?) by Gen Urobuchi, sometimes known as &quot;Uro the Butcher.&quot; I&#39;ve already said all this, but I&#39;m reiterating it just to remind you that Uro&#39;s MO is <i>ripping your heart out and eating it in front of you while you cry tears of pain and sorrow</i>. If you don&#39;t want to watch characters suffer, you&#39;ve been warned.<br><br>Now, we&#39;re not actually talking about the light novel, because nobody reads that because light novels suck and the ones I want to read never get translated (Hurry up, fan translators, <i>The El-Melloi II Case Files</i> look amazing). No, we&#39;re talking about the anime adaptation by Ufotable that came out in 2011 and caused everyone to look up and go &quot;whoa, that Studio DEEN adaptation of Fate Stay/Night was really rubbish, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; But the plot&#39;s the same.<br><br>And seeing as this is the sixth paragraph and I still haven&#39;t gotten into it, I should explain what the plot actually <i>is</i>. <i>Fate/Zero</i> is the story of the <i>Fourth</i> Holy Grail War, directly preceding the events of <i>Fate Stay/Night</i>. Unlike the Fifth Holy Grail War, which is a massive clustershpx, the Fourth Holy Grail War is... probably one of the few that was relatively close to what was intended. Or maybe not. It&#39;s hard to say. The point is, there are seven masters, all mages, except this time around most of them aren&#39;t children or otherwise clueless, and while Kiritsugu Emiya is ostensibly our hero, we spend a bunch of time with every Master in the war and each one really gets a lot of development and fleshing out. We know why they&#39;re willing to risk their lives in a war this dangerous, and why we should care.<br><br>Also, while Kiritsugu Emiya is ostensibly our hero, are actual heroes are the Master Waver Velvet and his Servant Iskandar, of the rider class. Because they are just... the best, they have an amazing dynamic, and Iskandar in particular steals every moment he&#39;s onscreen and at least a few where he isn&#39;t.<br><br>Okay, that was a joke, but they actually ARE the best. I&#39;m not even kidding, it&#39;s not up for debate. I mean, you&#39;re welcome to <i>disagree</i>, it&#39;s just that there&#39;s no way in a million years you&#39;re changing my mind on this, I wrote in Iskandar as my lust object on the official PPC census, that is how much you&#39;re not going to convince me otherwise.<br><br>But jokes and personal foibles aside, the war is very well balanced. Not to the point that you could root for <i>anyone</i>, but everyone has understandable reasons to do what they do. I never felt like I couldn&#39;t at least sort of understand a character, or at least the ideals that they represented. Because as always, Fate is all about ideals.<br><br>But since we&#39;ve been on plot for awhile, I&#39;d just like to take a moment and say one thing: This anime is <i>beautiful</i>. Ufotable is one of the few studios that&#39;s been able to consistently mix CG and traditional animation in a large-scale way and have it actually look not just passable, but actually good, and <i>genuinely artful</i>. Okay, it does fall down a little bit in a scene or two, but <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> at horrific cutaways to PS2-level CG animated space stations and that&#39;s still a classic. And most of the time, this show just looks so, <i>so</i> good. <br><br>So now that I&#39;ve talked up how both amazing and gorgeous this show is, and I am just now mentioning that it&#39;s available on Netflix right now to watch and enjoy, here comes the Hard Question: When should I watch <i>Fate/Zero</i>?<br><br>Honestly, that&#39;s not as easy a question to answer as you might think. See, Fate/Zero is first on the timeline, but it somehow still manages to spoil bits of Fate Stay/Night, in particular major aspects of the Fate route that everyone&#39;s already had spoiled for them, and even <i>more</i> major elements of the Heaven&#39;s Feel route that you might not have had spoiled for you yet, as well as, of course, spoiling a lot of other minor things, and a pretty major aspect of Fate lore. Furthermore, while Ufotable did their best to make this show accessible to newcomers, the original light novel really didn&#39;t, and assumed you were already entrenched in Fate&#39;s world and lore. There&#39;s only so much someone adapting a work can do, especially when they already have to cut it down to fit into 24 episodes of video. So parts are somewhat confusing and may not make a whole lot of sense to people who haven&#39;t already had an introduction to the universe, even though they do their best to give you at least a good chunk of that introduction.<br><br>And of course, seeing as Unlimited Blade Works is based on a VN route that assumes you&#39;ve already had a ton of exposition, it doesn&#39;t really give you that either, especially since the adaptation is set up as a sequel to <i>Fate/Zero</i>. Of course, you could watch Studio DEEN&#39;s 2006 <i>Fate Stay/Night</i> anime, but that was rubbish and everybody knows it.<br><br>So what I recommend, frankly, is one of two things. 1) Either invest the time in reading the visual novel, and then go watch this (and maybe Unlimited Blade Works, because man that adaptation is beautiful even if you already know what will happen), or 2) Just say &quot;to hell with it&quot;, bite the bullet, and watch this adaptation. Maybe follow it up with Unlimited Blade Works or something else. Sure, you&#39;ll be confused, and this recommendation is tantamount to heresy in the Fate fandom, but you&#39;ll get the gist of everything, and honestly, I think <i>Fate/Zero</i> might just be the very best of everything Fate has to offer, so as much as I love <i>Fate Stay/Night</i>, flaws and all, if you are going to watch/read/play one and only one thing in the Fate universe, I think that <i>Fate/Zero</i> is what you should pick.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll say that it&#39;s definitely worth it if you can forgive some rather cringey romance.

            <p>&quot;I remember you. Odd thing that I refer to you as such, but...&quot;<br><br>Amber interrupted herself. It was a confusing train of thought and she was digressing anyways. She stood up from the tree stump she was sitting on.<br><br>The large patch of grass surrounded by a forest was not supposed to be there and would most likely dissapear when canon returned to normal. Amber considered it could perform one last service before that. <br>She started walking around in it.<br><br>&quot;I remember you. I remember every Bubble you went to. I remember every Bubble your men went to. Every Bubble your race went to. You made it a point to remember them, and so I remember them.&quot; <br><br>Geographical distortions caused by Suefluences are a really interesting topic. The patch of grass was REALLY not supposed to be there, and it was of an unnaturally bright green color. The grass Amber stepped on immediately blackened and died.<br><br>&quot;You also made it a point to remember your names, and a good thing you did, because they would have been lost. And you with them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I remember how you felt. Tension, knowing that each battle could be your last. Determination, knowing that whatever the result you&#39;d see it through. Joy, knowing that Intervention wasn&#39;t necessary. A million times across a million Bubbles.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And then the Mindwalker had the Reality Warper unmake you.&quot;<br><br>Amber stopped. She looked at the sky. The sun was setting down, casting long shadows from the trees. The forest dwellers would arrive soon, and they were not to be trifled with.<br><br>&quot;They are now beyond reach. It&#39;s sad that you had to go, but it&#39;s worse knowing that you can&#39;t even be avenged.&quot;<br><br>She started pacing again.<br><br>&quot;But you aren&#39;t really gone, are you? I remember you. &#39;Names are important. Never lose yours.&#39; That was one of the creeds of your race. Even though you too may be beyond reach, your names are still there. Even if I am the only one that remembers them, it means that you are still there.&quot;<br><br>Amber stopped pacing again. She had drawn a full circle with the blackened grass.<br><br>&quot;The Circle. It should be blue, but nobody ever really gets what they want. &#39;Earth exists whereever there is someone acting in its service. Where you go, Earth goes.&#39; That&#39;s another creed of your race. The planet itself may be gone, but Earth is still here. It goes where I go&quot;<br><br>&quot;I remember you. And I will continue to do so, forever.&quot;</p>

            <p>WARNING: Major spoilers for the <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> series. If you haven&#39;t read <i>All the Weyrs of Pern</i> or <i>The Dolphins of Pern</i>, you should probably click Back right now.<br><br>Still here?<br><br>Okay then.<br><h3>Season&#39;s Beginning</h3>Project Overkill had been a triumph. Days later, its success was confirmed by the oddly anticlimactic bloom of fire on the surface of the Red Star, but E’rik and Skepnadth had nearly slept through it. The extraordinary plot to alter the path of the Red Star by detonating the great star-engines of the Yokohama, Bahrain, and Buenos Aires at carefully picked sites had required the participation of nearly every bronze and green dragon on Pern. The extreme distance and effort involved had left many of them drained.<br><br>It had been the thrill of a lifetime, a historic moment the likes of which would never come again. Despite their torpor, everyone was riding high, especially after the browns, blues, and golds got their share of the glory, pushing the empty husks of the old ships toward their final rest in the heart of Rukbat.<br><br>Later again, man and dragon had fully recovered. The deep, antique luster had returned to the bronze’s hide. They and some of their wingmates had taken a late morning jaunt east along the coast from Monaco Bay on what was ostensibly a hunt, but was really just an excuse to put the wind back in their wingsails. The hot season was months away, and although Thread would still linger for the remainder of this Pass, the promise of a future in which only rain would fall from the sky gave the air a fresh, heady vitality.<br><br>They were midair, flying low and slow for home, when it happened. Out of nowhere, Skepnadth gave a sharp cry of distress and backed air, keening.<br><br>Terror lanced E’rik’s heart. <i>What is it? What’s wrong?</i> He thought wildly that some delayed effect of space exposure must be afflicting his dragon and urged him to land at once, but Skepnadth shook his great head.<br><br><i>The Weyr needs us,</i> he said, sorrow lading his thoughts, and pumped his wings. A keen trembled in his throat even as he flew.<br><br>Only then did E’rik realize <i>every</i> dragon with them was keening, crying a death-knell. A lump of dread rose in his throat. <i>But what happened? Who . . . ?</i> Not Amaranth, surely? Monaco’s queen was young, healthy. Could something have happened to T’gellan’s Monarth?<br><br><i>No,</i> said Skepnadth. <i>The Harper has gone.</i><br><br>There was no doubt who he meant—everyone on two legs and four knew of Masterharper Robinton. Further, Skepnadth knew him from E’rik’s memories of his first five years in the Harper Hall, before the Masterharper’s heart attack had forced him into retirement. To E’rik, as to many harpers of his generation, Robinton was an awesome figure, someone he admired and strove to emulate, who despite his great importance had always been as a beloved father to his hall full of sons and daughters. His heir Sebell was a worthy master of the crafthall, but Robinton would always be the Harper.<br><br>E’rik couldn’t believe what he was hearing. <i>That’s not possible. Someone’s telling you tales.</i><br><br>He felt more than heard the sad, apologetic rumble in Skepnadth’s chest. <i>Tiroth’s man sees. Ruth’s man sees. They know. The little cousin has gone, too,</i> he added, meaning Robinton’s bronze fire-lizard, Zair. Admiration for draconic devotion on the part of a mere fire-lizard colored his tone.<br><br><i>But . . .</i> Though dragons couldn’t lie, E’rik’s heart still denied what his mind knew. <i>He was rescued. He recovered from the abduction. We just saved Pern! How could he die now?</i><br><br>Skepnadth took a moment to reply. No doubt the air was thick with telepathic messages flying back and forth in a jumble of confusion and grief. <i>They say he was with Aivas. It is as though they simply went to sleep—the Harper, the little cousin, and Aivas. There is a message: ‘And a time to every purpose under heaven.’ I don’t know what that means,</i> he answered before E’rik could ask.<br><br>He shook his head. It was too much, too impossible to process. <i>Let’s get home.</i><br><br>The news was confirmed back in Monaco Bay Weyr, many times over, yet it still refused to sink in, though the tears of others loosed his own. E’rik found himself cossetted and fussed over along with the official Weyrharper and anyone else who had ever served in the Harper Hall. He lost track of how many times he said <i>thank you,</i> or <i>that’s kind of you,</i> or <i>I’m sorry, I really didn’t know him well, he left when I was just an apprentice.</i> He took it all in a daze until finally someone was kind enough to settle him down in his weyr with a dose of fellis to stop his mind’s turning and spare his dragon a sleepless night.<br><br>He finally wept in earnest the day of the burial at sea, which he and Skepnadth overflew along with what seemed like every dragon and fire-lizard on Pern. The air was so thick with wingbeats that the sound was a physical force, but somehow the voices of Menolly and Sebell cut through, raising up in tribute the songs that were not the least part of the legacy the Masterharper of Pern left behind him. The cruelty of it, that those who had been closest to Robinton must hold their tears in check to do their duty by him, that struck home. He cried for them first, and all the others who felt the Harper’s loss most keenly. Then for himself, that he had taken the man for granted as a child, hadn’t had the privilege of knowing him as an adult, and now never would.<br><br>The mystery of Aivas’ final words rankled in his mind. All he could get anyone to tell him about them was that they were a reference to a passage from an ancient’s ancient book of myths about some invisible lord and his laws, which seemed harsh and changed arbitrarily from tale to tale. How was that a fitting epitaph for his Master, who was known for being just and forgiving at all times, even to people who didn’t deserve it?<br><br>E’rik finally got so fed up with second- and third-hand nonsense that he reserved a time for himself with one of the all-knowing Aivas consoles to see if he could find a more satisfactory explanation. He didn’t like the Ancients’ computer system—its visual language of alien symbols and the mixed-up letters of the keyboard made him feel slow and clumsy, which he wasn’t, even with one eye blinded by his near-fatal Threadscarring three Turns ago. It was agonizing to hunt through text files all relating to this “Bible” of Old Terra, but finally, he came across an audio file. His eye had glazed over to the point that he nearly missed it and had to scroll back up.<br><br>“The Byrds?” he muttered aloud. “‘Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season).’ Three Turns; that’s many seasons.” It was a bad joke, just to wake himself up. He knew well enough that the Terrans had used a different term for a world’s orbital period.<br><br>He felt Skepnadth rouse and listen with him as he played the file. The words as sung were nearly unintelligible, but he knew their meaning by now, and the mellow voices of the singers and their guitars touched him bittersweetly. So did the six new words at the end. “A time for war, and a time for peace—<i>I swear it’s not too late</i>.” Six simple words changed the message from one of passively accepting the inevitability of change to one of embracing hope.<br><br><i>Did you hear all that?</i> he asked Skepnadth.<br><br><i>Yes. I like it. You feel better now, and that’s good.</i><br><br>E’rik chuckled. <i>High praise. And you’re right. You know, everyone has been talking about things ending. The end of Thread, the end of tradition, the end of Aivas . . . the end of Master Robinton. But that’s only one face of the mark.</i><br><br><i>When one season ends, a new one begins.</i><br><br><i>You really were listening!</i><br><br><i>Of course.</i> The bronze sounded almost offended. <i>This is important to you. If I didn’t listen when it was important, what sort of dragon would I be?</i><br><br><i>You’re the best dragon on Pern,</i> said every rider to his beast, and E’rik meant it now as much as all of them. <i>And you’re right again. It’s a new season—a new Turn—a new era. It’s ours, and now it’s up to us to make it a good one. That’s the message he’d want us to remember.</i><br><br>E’rik shut down the console and left the building. His fingers were already shaping the chords he and Skepnadth hummed.<br><br><hr>
<br>Aivas&#39; Bible reference bugs me in a way I can&#39;t fully articulate. No argument that it&#39;s an important enough facet of humanity&#39;s history that it should be preserved for study, but making an artificial intelligence in an otherwise completely agnostic SF series talk about it like it&#39;s our greatest achievement is so jarring. The Pernese deliberately eschewed religious superstition in favor of ennobling real-life, down-to-earth heroism. It&#39;s just a weird move on McCaffrey&#39;s part.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There&#39;s something very moving about someone listening to (what to them is certainly) ancient music after a bereavement. You&#39;ve captured the mood well, especially with the song choice. This may fade, it seems to say, but it will still be real, it will still have happened, and for all that it will pass the pain you are feeling is real and valid and <i>okay</i>. I think that&#39;s what I like about the use of telepathy in this; it allows you to explore an emotional connection without either party being able to hide it, and gives them both a chance to express private vulnerabilities, private griefs.<br><br>Really, really good stuff.

            <p>The song wasn&#39;t really a choice, though. It&#39;s the text of that Bible passage set to music. The way I see it, that&#39;s the much more fitting way to honor a harper, and Aivas has several versions of &quot;Home on the Range,&quot; of all silly things, in its databanks, so I don&#39;t think an extremely well-known protest song with extremely well-known lyrics was too much of a stretch.

            <p>It&#39;s not... good. It can be entertaining, and it&#39;s not badly written, but it&#39;s not very good, to my mind. I also just had a hard time enjoying a lot of it, even as a kid. Too... mean, I guess? The tone&#39;s off.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that it is explicitly designed as indoctrination material for the Eliezer Yudkowsky&#39;s cult. That part just turned me off it. Yes, some of his ideas are <i>right</i> and he explains them well (usually his explanations of common fallacies), but the usual quote that shows up at this point is that the good parts aren&#39;t original and the original parts aren&#39;t good. Yudkowsky likes to act like he&#39;s an academic, but don&#39;t be fooled: he never finished highschool, he&#39;s almost never been published outside his own blogs and organizations, and he has a lot of wrong, unscientific ideas that he tends to mix with fact (see his ideas about quantum physics), ans is in fact derisive of actual scientists in many cases. His ideas about transhumanism and AI are... questionable (especially AI, seeing as he believes computers with consciousness are coming Real Soon Now™ despite a total lack of proof).<br><br>And normally I wouldn&#39;t bring the author into it: Orson Scott Card is an awful person in my opinion, but Ender&#39;s Game is still brilliant. However, HPMoR is expressly designed to spread the ideas I find suspect. And the protagonist is an insufferable Mary Sue, too, almost by definition.<br><br>So in short, you can read it, and might even find it enjoyable. Just be careful not to buy too deeply into what it&#39;s selling.</p>

            <p>So... I may of got slightly carried away with one of my Halloween prompts (One of your characters meets a monster to be exact) and well... <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FzBfxr4FHo3RWC2mSes4wun1YEInIXnuypFt5iBGFWg/edit?usp=sharing">this happened.</a><br><br>There&#39;s a little disclaimer in the doc itself so all I&#39;ll say is it involves the characters of, and is based on a Skyrim fanfic I am thinking of writing at some point.

            <p>The clock told the time, again and again and again. Tick followed tock followed tick. Cass stood in front of it and stared.<br><br>&quot;... I thought you&#39;d like it.&quot;<br><br>Cass stood.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s just, your collection... gurl, you <i>love</i> it. Got more clocks on the walls than books, and that&#39;s saying a lot. Like, a <i>lot</i> a lot.&quot;<br><br>Cass stared.<br><br>&quot;So when I saw-&quot;<br><br>&quot;You did.&quot;<br><br>Em looked at her partner, eyebrows rising up a little. &quot;Uh, yeah, I said I-&quot;<br><br>&quot;You mistake my meaning.&quot; The words were flat and spat and dark. &quot;You saw, and then you did. You didn&#39;t ask. You didn&#39;t check. You didn&#39;t discuss. You. Just. <i>Did</i>. Just like always.&quot;<br><br>Em stepped back, eyes wide, face slowly losing colour and leaving bone white. &quot;Cass, I&#39;m sorry, how, how do I make this-&quot;<br><br>Cass turned to look at Em, and the girl took another step back. &quot;You want to make it right? Here&#39;s what you do. You go shopping.&quot;<br><br>Em couldn&#39;t think of any words that made sense. Cass just continued, her voice short and sharp as thorns. &quot;Oh, am <br>I not making myself clear? Let me spell it out for you, then. You go to New Caledonia and you go shopping. You take the money <i>I make</i> selling trinkets as fandom props on World One&#39;s Etsy, and you go shopping. You buy yourself some clothes or shoes or makeup. You buy an expensive coffee that&#39;s mostly whipped cream and sprinkles and pumpkin spice flavouring syrup. You buy whatever gimcracks and bits of tourist tat that catches your eye and satisfies your magpie instinct-&quot;<br><br>Tears rolled down Em&#39;s face. &quot;Cassie, please, you&#39;re shouting.&quot;<br><br>&quot;-because that&#39;s what gets you through the day, isn&#39;t it, Emily Perilled? Having things. Preferably things that are sparkly and gaudy and ostentatiously expensive. You&#39;re a hoarder and you justify it with some vague garbage about <i>retail therapy</i> because you think that if you have no things then you&#39;re nothing. Well, guess what? You <i>are</i> nothing. And all the knock-off designer clothing in the world won&#39;t get rid of the emptiness in whatever shrivelled, battered little shred inside you&#39;s passing for a soul. So go. Enjoy yourself on someone else&#39;s dime, you <i>leech</i>. Have <i>fun</i>.&quot;<br><br>The clock ticked and tocked and landed on the floor when it slipped from Cass&#39;s flimsy grip. Em didn&#39;t see it thud into the thick blue Axminster carpet, kept safe from breakage by the Cushioning Charms where the driver&#39;s seat would once have been.<br><br>She was already gone.<br><br>---<br><br>The clock ticked on.<br><br>The RC door hissed open. Feet came through, wiped themselves off on the ugly tie-dyed blanket thing pressed into service as a doormat. They were loud, and only got louder.<br><br>Cass looked up into Em&#39;s frightened face.<br><br>&quot;Cassie, have you moved?&quot;<br><br>The witch said nothing.<br><br>&quot;It, it&#39;s been two days. I&#39;m worried about you.&quot;<br><br>In the smallest voice Em had ever heard, Cass said &quot;Why?&quot;<br><br>Em just wrapped Cass up in her arms and didn&#39;t let go.<br><br>The clock ticked on.<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t a clock, you know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm?&quot;<br><br>The clock ticked on, as it had for some time. It was three in the morning and the both of them were tired. Their eyes were red and sore and their noses chapped from blowing. Crying&#39;s ugly when it means something.<br><br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t a clock,&quot; Cass continued. &quot;It was an old fob watch in a carriage clock mounting. The pattern was me, I did all the transfiguring myself. Took me ages to get the petals right. That&#39;s why there were all bits chipped off from the side. But the mechanism, the heart of it... the truth of the clock was a watch.<br><br>&quot;You get one when you&#39;re seventeen. It&#39;s a wizard thing. The one in there was, well. See, that&#39;s the thing. I don&#39;t <i>know</i> whose it was. Found it in a junk shop in Muggle London and fell in love. It didn&#39;t work, never would again without a shedload of repairing charms, but that didn&#39;t matter. I didn&#39;t want it to work. It didn&#39;t feel right. It wasn&#39;t my watch, you see, I was just... I dunno, looking after it, I suppose. But I was going to be given one of my own, when I was seventeen, and I promised myself I&#39;d fix it then.<br><br>&quot;The guy in the shop told me it was old, and I could see it. There was an inscription I found in the case, and I couldn&#39;t make it out. It tore the name off, you see, but I could see a date. 1913. He wouldn&#39;t have been more than twenty-two when he died. Probably more like twenty. Off to war and home by Christmas and instead he died in a bombed-out ditch or hung up on barbed wire or stabbed in the gut. His watch stopped at eleven.<br><br>&quot;And then came my war. My friends lying dead on the roads and stairs and grounds. People I&#39;d grown up around killing and fighting. The, the <i>death</i> of it all. Lights in the sky and worlds on fire and then it all... stopped. Faded, like a bad dream. And I knew then, if I didn&#39;t get out, that I&#39;d fade too. And it&#39;s the stupidest things you think of when you know you&#39;re going to die, because all I could think in my stupid fat head was &#39;Nobody&#39;s going to give me a watch&#39;.<br><br>&quot;So I tried to, to Apparate. Nobody taught me that either, I just knew you could do it if you tried. Everyone else was drifting away. I ran out of the grounds and into Hogsmeade as it turned greyer and greyer and I flung every bit of strength I had into this one spell to <i>stay alive</i> and... well, here I am. Left bits of myself behind on the trip too. Loads of hair and a couple of back teeth and my left kneecap and everyone I&#39;d ever loved. But not this... this knackered old watch in a knackered old clock carriage covered in poppies.<br><br>&quot;So I painted them, after I got out of the bacta tank. I painted them red at first, to honour the dead, but then I painted them white, to remember why they died. A callous and evil war prosecuted by a madman and his pet murderers. I kept the watch broken, too, even though it wouldn&#39;t even be hard to fix. It wasn&#39;t mine. It wasn&#39;t my <i>right</i>. I was just... looking after it, for now. You know, sometimes, when I looked at the watch face and those cheap, bent hands, I could hear the guns. They tear up the earth, you know. Pull down trees and hills and make a wasteland of everything around them. Wars, I mean. But the guns help with that.&quot;<br><br>Everything was quiet for a bit.<br><br>&quot;They shall not grow old,&quot; Em said softly, &quot;as we that are left grow old.&quot;<br><br>Cass looked up again. &quot;What&#39;s that from?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s from a poem. British, actually. I&#39;m kinda surprised you don&#39;t know it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hogwarts doesn&#39;t teach anything other than magic, and Muggle Studies is a bad joke anyway. Frankly, I&#39;m amazed any of us learned how to bloody read.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot;<br><br>The clock ticked on.<br><br>&quot;They will not grow old, as we that are left grow old,&quot; Em said. &quot;Age shall not wither them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.&quot;<br><br>Cass said nothing for a while.<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered, voice hoarse and crusted with salt. &quot;We will.&quot;<br><br>The clock ticked on from its place face-up on the floor, hands turning little by little, moving forward.</p>

            <p>First thing is that you did a good job using description and dialogue style to get the rather intense emotional states running around this whole story across.<br><br>That all being said, I&#39;m not completely sure what it is set Em did to set all this off. My initial guess was buying Cass another clock for her collection. By the end of the story (and this was my second reading) I&#39;d switched over to Em fixing the watch that wasn&#39;t supposed to be fixed being the underlying issue, but I&#39;m not completely sure of that.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Yeah, it&#39;s the second one that&#39;s correct. Em fixing the stopped clock was something that caused Cass to snap in the kind of completely unjustified and nuclear way common to people with trauma.</p>

            <p>I like Em and Cass, from the stories I&#39;ve read with them before. It was hard to see Cass be that nasty to Em, and Em be hurt badly but not say anything about it.<br><br>I understand it. This thing with the watch touched a trauma, and trauma can manifest itself in unpredictable and nasty ways. I know Cass was sorry for it afterward. I assume that there was an apology given amidst the ugly crying, perhaps even some acknowledgement that Em meant well and Cass overreacted because of something that doesn&#39;t really have to do with an old, broken watch, but rather with a much deeper horror and (I think) shame. It&#39;s good that she was able to talk about it rationally afterward. I sure hope Em has some external support for herself, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In answer to your question: it&#39;s been briefly mentioned, but Em and Cass are both in the care of FicPsych more often than not. Em favours group therapy, while Cass prefers one-to-one sessions. It&#39;s been briefly touched upon a few times here and there in other Cass and Em stories, but they are not without their own independent support networks.<br><br>You&#39;re right that there was an apology in the ugly crying. I wanted to write it so that a lot of time was passing with both characters in something of a hole. As for acknowledging Em meant well, it almost certainly did happen, but Cass (as we&#39;ve seen) has a self-flagellatory instinct and a very sharp tongue so it probably got twisted into something very nasty being said about herself. Why didn&#39;t I <i>write</i> any of that? Well, it&#39;s mostly because I felt like it would have really slowed the story down. It might also have become repetitive fast; there&#39;s only so many times you can apologise for something before it all starts to ring a little hollow.<br><br>You mention Em being hurt badly but not say anything about it. She&#39;s not the kind of person who says when she&#39;s hurting (this may have something to do with why she&#39;s in FicPsych); instead, she backs off or runs away or plasters on a fake smile to brush it aside. Despite being from a very action-heavy setting initially and being, y&#39;know, a DMS assassin, Em really doesn&#39;t deal well with conflict. I&#39;ve tried to show it in the other stories, but if it&#39;s not been clear then that&#39;s on me.<br><br>Poor Em. I feel I should write a story about her having a nice time with some friends, but it&#39;s me and I seem to have <s>stolen</s> inherited Ix&#39;s portable feels generator so maybe that&#39;s not such a brilliant idea. =]</p>

            <p>I agree that, story-wise, including all of that stuff would be beside the point. If this were part of a longer arc about their relationship, then it would be relevant, but as a concise one-shot about remembering and mourning, not so much.<br><br>It&#39;s been a while since I checked in with the prompts, since I haven&#39;t written one (or much of anything else) in some time, so I&#39;ve certainly missed things you&#39;ve established in previous pieces. It&#39;s to your credit that I don&#39;t feel like I have. I can jump back in feeling invested, and everything required to interpret what happened between scenes is there. I was just worried and wanted to know everything would work out and be okay in the end. {= )<br><br>I love my angst, too, but I&#39;m an optimist, dammit. The point of putting characters in a hole is to see them claw their way back out again, because they CAN.

            <p>&quot;Tom,&quot; said Thoth. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;<br><br>The Astartes had just gotten back to the RC after a hard day of training. Thoth liked to say that he&#39;d never been so inactive as he was at the PPC, but between keeping himself fit and psychically developed, keeping his psychic abilities developed, canon research, and Derik, he&#39;d done a fine job keeping himself busy.<br><br>But while he&#39;d seen a lot of strange things in his time at the PPC, and heard many an odd tale, he&#39;d never seen his partner look so sad. Nor had he ever seen him wearing anything more formal than a clean T-shirt, much less something like a black button-up and a tie.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m headed to the funeral, Thoth,&quot; Tom said solemnly. There was not an ounce of his usual humor in his voice. &quot;A hero has died. No, a hero of heroes. And I am joining so many others in commemorating him.&quot;<br><br>Thoth was silent for a moment. If his partner was truly this serious... &quot;I would be honored, then, if I could join you.&quot;<br><br>Tom looked up in shock. &quot;Really?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course. It is important to remember the dead, Tom. Especially the heroes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Thank you.&quot;<br><br>--<br><br>And so Tom and Thoth stood, Tom in his shirt and tie and Thoth in his robe, their heads bowed solemnly, only two points in a throng of agents, big and small, young and old, of every canon, continuum, age, race, and creed. Some stood bowed, some suppressed tears, some tried to stay strong. They were dressed in black, white, red, and orange. They wore robes, cloaks, jackets, suits, a thousand different ceremonial outfits, tuxedos, and cosplay outfits. <br><br>They stood united, hearing the words that echoed through the silent room.<br><br>&quot;We are gathered here today in memory of Stan Lee...&quot;</p>

            <p>Emiranlanoamar sat at the weapons bench, looking down at the staser carbine in front of him. Tools were neatly arranged by his left hand, a set of cleaning rags by his right, and various gardening supplies in front of him, behind his work mat. <br><br>“Let’s begin, shall we.”<br><br>The Time Lord began by checking the carbine’s magazine well, then the residual charge dampener. Wouldn’t be a good start if he were to blow a hole in the table with a chambered energy bolt. Satisfied that the weapon was safe to disassemble, he pushed out a few holding pins and pulled apart the carbine’s exterior casing. <br><br>“I’ve been waiting a long time to do this, Yannogarsil. It’s all your fault.” Emiran set aside the casing, turning his attention to the carbine’s internal dimensional compressors. “I’m sorry it took so long, old friend.” He took his laser screwdriver and unscrewed the barrel/condenser assembly, removed it from the carbine’s main body, then disabled the compressors. The assembly grew four times as large without the dimension-suppressing fields. The staser’s barrel was easily unscrewed from the condenser arrays; Emiran put it on a cleaning rag to keep it from rolling away. He opened the condenser box and found what he was looking for: the complex set of lenses used to generate, focus, and collimate the staser bolt.<br><br>“I remember. A long time ago, you asked me if weapons kept you safe. I said of course they didn’t: a weapon only brings death. A technically correct answer,” said Emiran, delicately withdrawing the lenses one at the time with a gloved hand. “My favourite kind of correct. But I digress. No, I said a weapon can only kill-- and I remember you disagreed. Hah, you even challenged me back then: after the whole War blows over, we find a way to use weapons to give life. Well...” He looked at the disassembled carbine. “I admit I cheated. I’m using its spare parts. But then again, isn’t that the whole point?” The lenses all removed, he set them aside and grabbed a plasma cutter. “We are at peace now, and we have rebuilt. From death, life. And so there is no need for weapons any more.” <br><br>He cut away large, circular cylinders from the carbine’s barrel with the cutter. Emiran then closed one end of the cylinders by bending the metal with a welda-clamp and added steel wires all around the pot slowly taking shape. Over the course of several hours he fashioned loops at the end of the wires and added the carbine’s focusing lenses in them, occasionally using a matter pen to add or remove layers of the lenses. He sighted down the new lens assembly, then used his laser screwdriver to shine light through the lenses. The focused beam was now a diffuse, gentle spot on the bottom of the pot. From the remainders of the carbine, he pulled the power transformer and mounted it on a pole made from the remains of the weapon’s barrel.<br><br>“You studied botany, as I remember,” continued Emiran. “Your entire graduation thesis was on the life cycles of plants only found megaflora worlds near high-radiation stars. That was a good talk, by the way. Brilliant thesis defence-- learned a lot. Enough to know that there exist rare flowers that grow on the forest floor who live off the patches of intense light that filter down from the tree crowns.” Emiran lined up the power source down his new series of focusing lenses. “Or should I say, light shooting down from above...?”<br><br>Emiran sighed and leaned back in his chair, looking up at the clock mounted over his bench. That late already? He glanced back at his project. “Sorry, Yan. Gonna have to leave you for tonight. Sleep, then work calls. But that’s how it goes.” He yawned and stood up, stretching as he did so. “It takes time to rebuild, you know. But it’s all worth it in the end. Life prevails.” As an afterthought, he reached towards the gardening supplies and tipped a bit of soil into the pot. He delicately smoothed out the surface with a finger, then placed a single bean-sized seed on the soil. <br><br>The Time Lord smiled to himself as he slowly walked out of the room, casting one last glance back at his plant incubator before making his way towards the RC&#39;s kitchenette for a midnight snack.</p>

            <p>I like the way you sort of show us everything at the beginning, but we still have to read to the end for all the pieces to fall into the right places. All the little details about the tools he&#39;s using and the bits of tech he&#39;s using them on are great. I don&#39;t know for sure what they all are, but they&#39;re applied with such precision that I can guess, and that I have no doubt you know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. I can even visualize the project fairly well, or at least I think I could if I gave it a bit more time to gel. (I have a bad habit of skimming description to get to the dialogue/action, so that&#39;s definitely my failing, not yours.) Swords to ploughshares is a theme I can absolutely get behind, too. Or stasers to megaflora incubators. {= )<br><br>I now want to know all about megaflora on high radiation worlds. ^_^<br><br>Always good to see you posting!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>((Though, really, what did you expect, posting something like this when I&#39;m around?))<br><br><br>&quot;Hey, guys.&quot;<br><br>The Aviator sat on the ground in front of her crew&#39;s gravestones. The courtyard was full of red and gold leaves, and the wind was beginning to get a bit nippy. She pulled her dog tags over her head, running her thumb over each of the names in turn. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m doing a lot better now than last time,&quot; she continued. &quot;Finally got help for my drinking problem. Been going to therapy.&quot; The tags clinked between her fingers as she turned them over. &quot;Elanor&#39;s going to be two in <br>just eleven days,&quot; she added. &quot;She&#39;s growing up into such an awesome kid. You guys would love her. Gavin... you&#39;d have been proud of her. Dee&#39;s proud of her, too. Even if he doesn&#39;t really say it.&quot; <br><br>The Aviator swallowed away the lump in her throat and smiled. &quot;I think it&#39;s safe to say I&#39;m... happy again. Or getting there. I did promise I wouldn&#39;t wallow anymore, didn&#39;t I?&quot; She put the chain over her head, tucking the tags back down her shirt. &quot;How long has it been since I came to visit, anyway? Three months? Let me think... Oh! Elanor&#39;s got almost all her teeth now. I&#39;m starting to teach her addition and subtraction—I know, I really should have started nearly a month ago. Zeb&#39;s been excited to help out, he makes up little counting songs for her....&quot;</p>

            <p><i>(A/N: I apologize for this being un-betaed. I couldn&#39;t not do this, and I hope it delivers.)</i><br><br>Sarah looked away from the screen, tears pouring down her cheeks.<br><br>“What’s wrong?” her angel companion asked, instinct telling him that something was indeed very, very wrong.<br><br>Sarah was silent. Her partners looked up from whatever they were doing, worried expressions on their faces. Sarah Katherine Squall was virtually never silent. If she was… That was a cause for concern.<br><br>Lapis walked over to her, and patted her shoulder, almost expecting her hand to be swatted away, but the rebuke never came.<br><br>“It’s alright to let us know.” The blue-haired girl’s voice was kind, learned, sympathetic. “There’s no need to keep things quiet with us two. We are your partners, after all.”<br><br>The older girl sniffled, her head still bowed. “I never thought this day would come,” she said, forcing back a choked sob. “All my life, I thought that he was unchanging, forever, a constant force of goodness in this world.”<br><br>“He?” asked Cupid, beginning to sound worried. “Who’s he?”<br><br>“On an objective front, I knew the day would come when he’d finally leave this world,” the superheroine continued. “He was aging, and he had fought numerous illnesses before, and it was only a matter of time before he’d finally lose that internal fight. But that knowledge never made me ready for this, for the day, for the hour when his life would finally slip away.”<br><br>“And still the day came anyway,” Lapis finished. “But for whom?”<br><br>Sarah looked at her with a visage wracked with utter despair. “We were all blindsided. None of us could believe it at first, but then the truth finally began to sink in that it had happened. So many of us believed that we’d go through our entire life, and not know of it. And yet… Yet so many of us can now say that we lived to hear of it.<br><br>“Knowing that, knowing exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard of it… Knowing this fills me with a grief I can’t even begin to describe. Some would say that I shouldn’t care for losses outside of my own family. Believe me, I’ve heard that from some of my own family members. But it doesn’t change the fact that there’s been a hole blown in my heart that can never be filled ever again.”<br><br>Cupid realized that whomever she was talking about, it must’ve been very, very important to her. He tilted his head to notice that there was an article on the console screen. “Uh… Lapis? Could you read that? You guys know I can’t–”<br><br>“We do,” Lapis replied with an exasperated look. She glanced at the console, and once she saw the title of <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/stan-lee-dead-marvel-comics-real-life-superhero-was-95-721450">the article on the screen</a>, her eyes widened and she covered her mouth with both hands, a gasp of horror resounding throughout the RC.<br><br>“He was a great man,” said Sarah. “He still is a great man. None of us will ever forget what he did for you and I. For us. For everyone. The world will be a much sadder place without him, and the worst part of all is that it was a much happier place with him. There is nothing in the world we can ever do to repay him, and all we can do now is remember his life, his legacy, his greatness. All we can do is remember him as he was, as he is, and tell our children and our grandchildren about the wholesome greatness that they never were around to experience.”<br><br>“Oh dear Arceus…” was all Lapis could say. She looked to Cupid and mouthed, “Sarah’s favorite comics artist in the multiverse has passed away.”<br><br>The angel said nothing. He was as speechless as the other two. But then he got to his feet and walked over to his taller partner. And then he hugged her, enveloping her with his arms and wings and resting his head next to hers’.<br><br>Sarah hugged him back with one hand, and spread the other arm for Lapis to join. She did the same, tears of her own now leaking from the corners of her eyes. The dark-haired Super promptly buried her face in their shoulders, and started crying in earnest. And her partners cried too, sharing in her pain and grief.<br><br>Eventually, Sarah finally managed to calm down, though she was still sniffling and shuddering. She finally lifted her head and looked into the eyes of her partners, recognizing their sympathetic expressions.<br><br>“Thank you,” she said simply.<br><br>“Words fail me right now,” said Cupid. “I guess I can say that I hope all of us can eventually cope with the loss we’ve sustained.”<br><br>“I can’t agree more with that sentiment,” added Lapis.<br><br>Sarah turned back to the console and smiled, wiping the tears from her face. “Godspeed, you amazing, wonderful person, and may you find peace and prosperity in the multiverse beyond. <i>Excelsior.</i>” <br><br>“<i>Excelsior,</i>” repeated the other two.<br><br>They were silent for a long moment. And then Cupid piped up with “…You guys wanna watch <i>Ant Man and the Wasp</i> for movie night tonight? I… I actually haven’t seen that one. And it’s only fair that we spend the evening honoring him. For Sarah’s sake.”<br><br>The girls looked at each other, and exchanged smiles in spite of themselves.<br><br>“I’d like that more than anything, I think,” replied Sarah.<br><br><b>R.I.P. Stan Lee</b><br><b>December 28, 1922 - November 12, 2018</b><br><b>Excelsior</b></p>

            <p>And I mean really insane. This idea has been floating around in my head for a little while, and I thought the Board might enjoy it. <br><br>In which I merge the plots of <i> Aladdin</i> and <i> The Silmarillion</i> to come up with something that (hopefully) makes sense. And if it doesn&#39;t, I can just say that was the whole point!<br><br><br><br>“Father,” said Jasmine, “please! He might be a mortal man, but he is as valiant as any prince of Elves, and I love him more than anyone else in the world!”<br><br>Sultan Thingol stared at her without compassion. “Be that as it may,” he said sternly, “I will not marry my daughter to any but an elven prince.”<br><br>Aladdin met the Sultan’s eyes, unafraid. “I will return one day as anything you desire me to be. Until then, Jasmine, farewell.”<br><br>He bowed respectfully to the Sultan, and then turned and left.<br><br>“I am worried about what he may do,” said Queen Melian. “He is half-mad with love.”<br><br>“Father, I beg leave to go after him. I will find out his plans and inform you of them.”<br><br>Thingol glanced at his wife, who nodded. “Very well,” he said. “I give you ten minutes.”<br><br>“Thank you, Father,” said Jasmine, and dashed from the room.<br><br>“I am not worried,” Thingol replied, once Jasmine was safely out of earshot. “I am quite sure he will never return.”<br><br>Melian shook her head. “He is stronger than you know. His actions may have political repercussions far beyond his own fate.”<br><br>“We shall see,” Thingol murmured. “We shall see.”<br><br><br><br><br>“Aladdin! Wait!”<br><br>Aladdin turned slowly around. “Jasmine? Go back. It is not safe for you to come.”<br><br>“I do not ask to come,” Jasmine said, sounding slightly hurt. “I only wish to know what you will do.”<br><br>“I will become a prince of Elves, if that is what I must be to win you. I will find one of the legendary Silmarils, said to grant their bearer a wish.”<br><br>Jasmine gasped. “But the Silmarils are in the Iron Crown of Morgoth himself! You can’t possibly hope to enter Angband and come out alive!”<br><br>“If I do not, I can never hope to convince your father that I am worthy of you.”<br><br>“My father! What do you care about him? I do not need his approval for my actions. I am not a child. If he will not give his consent to our marriage, I will come with you and we shall find some place to live together, well away from Doriath.”<br><br>“No,” said Aladdin, “I will not take you if I have nothing to give you. I shall return, Jasmine, a prince as your father wishes, and the Silmaril will be your wedding gift.”<br><br>“Very well,” Jasmine replied after a pause, “go. But if you do not return – “<br><br>“I will,” insisted Aladdin. “Goodbye, Jasmine.”<br><br>“Goodbye,” she said softly, and then they turned away from each other.<br><br><br><br><br>Plans from here involve more plot-fusion with the sons of Feanor taking on the role of Jafar. And the idea of a Silmaril-genie is just too crazy to lose!<br><br></p>

            <p>Okay, Epic Fantasy roundup time! We know that a lot of fantasy (including Middle-earth) is inspired by British mythology and medieval Britain. But that&#39;s far from the only possible inspiration.<br><br>If you want Africa as your inspiration, check out N.K. Jesmin. Her Broken Earth series won the Hugo award for all 3 books (I believe that&#39;s the only time that&#39;s happened). I&#39;ve read the first one, and it&#39;s very different to your European fantasy.<br><br>Going specifically to the Middle East, Google recommends Saladin Ahmed&#39;s &#39;Throne of the Crescent Moon&#39;. I&#39;ve not read it, but the list looks trustworthy, since it also includes Jesmin and...<br><br>&#39;Earthsea&#39;! Ursula leGuin was inspired by North America, which gives the Earthsea books a distinctly different feel.<br><br>Also from North America: Niven and Pournelle&#39;s Burning City/Burning Tower duology, set mostly in prehistoric California.<br><br>And going back to Google&#39;s recommendations: how about a Central Asian fantasy where &#39;the sky changes color as you move between empires, moons come and go, some people live beneath cherry red skies, and humanoid tigers are a thing.&#39; That&#39;s Range of Ghosts, by Elizabeth Bear.<br><br>What I /don&#39;t/ know is how many of these were written by people actually immersed in and learned in the culture, as Tolkien was. Maybe if you read them, you can find out. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The plan is to more or less follow Silm up until the encounter with the Sons of Feanor after the rescue from Sauron. <br><br>At this stage the SoFs are impressed by Jasmine-Luthien&#39;s magic and realise they might actually have half a chance to get the Silmarils, so they &quot;offer their assistance&quot; in the quest.<br><br>They all proceed to Angband, Jasmine-Luthien puts Morgoth to sleep... and that&#39;s where it all goes horribly wrong: the SoFs turn on Aladdin-Beren and Jasmine-Luthien as soon as the Silmarils are out of the Iron Crown.<br><br>That&#39;s where I get stuck: I can&#39;t follow Silm canon any more and Aladdin canon seems rather unlikely if no new Silmarils are created.<br><br>There are several possibilities:<br><br>1. The inevitable battle wakes Morgoth.<br><br> This basically dooms everyone, but there&#39;s a chance that one or more of them could get away, perhaps with Silmarils. They wouldn&#39;t get far, though. <br><br>Who would try and fight and who would try and escape? Aladdin-Beren and Jasmine-Luthien would refuse to leave each other. They wouldn&#39;t willingly hand over the Silmarils to the SoFs, so if they ran the SoFs would follow them and no-one would get anywhere.<br><br>Obviously I want a happy ending, so I think that&#39;s more or less ruled out.<br><br>2. Morgoth doesn&#39;t wake up.<br><br>This is a lot more interesting because the fight would be quite evenly matched. Jasmine-Luthien probably doesn&#39;t have any magic left, and they couldn&#39;t realistically fight off two SoFs at once.<br><br>This would mean the SoFs win - except the Silmarils would burn their hands. Could either of them have anticipated this and brought gloves or a casket? <br><br>Exactly how bad is the hand-burning? Could it kill Elves, or would they be able to just think past it and run?<br><br>3. The Silmaril-genie is summoned.<br><br>That relies on a knowledge of what the Silmaril-genie actually is. My favourite theory so far is that it&#39;s actually Feanor himself, and some sort of magic tied his spirit to them after he died.<br><br>If the SoFs summon Feanor, they&#39;ve obviously won. Again, the requirement for a happy ending removes that option, depending on how you define &quot;happy&quot;. You could say that the SoFs are the lesser evil and that&#39;s good enough for you.<br><br>If Aladdin-Beren or Jasmine-Luthien summons Feanor, on the other hand...that depends exactly what they wish for. I presume that would be &quot;get all of us out of Angband&quot; which would be something everyone could agree on.<br><br>That just means continuing the fight outside - or Aladdin-Beren could make his wish to become an elf-prince and then abandon the Silmarils.<br><br>Most importantly, what on earth (I mean Arda) does this do to Silm canon? <br><br>That was a lot longer than I expected!<br><br></p>

            <p>For option 2, Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur aren&#39;t the brightest buttons in the box, so no, they wouldn&#39;t have brought gloves. As far as they&#39;re concerned, they have an absolute right to hold the Silmarils, so &#39;maybe they&#39;ll burn us&#39; isn&#39;t even on their radar.<br><br>Option 3... option 3 is interesting. ^_^<br><br>Feanor trapped in the Silmarilli makes, uh, &#39;sense&#39;; he&#39;s literally named Firesoul, and the things were designed to capture light. But how would he respond to being wished at?<br><br>Let&#39;s assume he&#39;s arbitrarily powerful at this point. He&#39;s had nearly 500 years of sitting around on Morgoth&#39;s head to hone his post-mortal artisan skills, I&#39;m sure he can craft a spiritual invention for every occasion. And rather than a literal &#39;has to do what you say&#39; (in which case Morgoth would already have used him), a &#39;will do pretty much anything to get away from Morgoth&#39; rule will function in much the same way, but still let him argue.<br><br>To hew a little close to Aladdin canon, the first &#39;wish&#39; could be the whole &#39;I bet you couldn&#39;t get us four out of here&#39;. That puts the gang <i>outside</i> Angband, where there&#39;s a rather angry wolf hanging around.<br><br>Hmm... what if the quartet appear in hiding, and it&#39;s Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur fighting with a) the lovers, b) their ghost-dad, and c) each other that attract Carcharoth. Then Aladdin gets his hand chomped (losing one of the three Silmarils), and <i>Jasmine</i> makes a wish on his behalf - &#39;he wishes for you to get us away from everyone trying to kill us!&#39; That matches Aladdin&#39;s second wish, and also gets around the eagle situation.<br><br>Feanor has to leave Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur behind (because they&#39;re part of the &#39;trying to kill us&#39;), which means Aladdin can do his &#39;make me a prince&#39; wish in relative peace. That runs him out of wishes, because the third one is locked in Carcharoth&#39;s belly.<br><br>So now we&#39;re in Doriath, and Sultan Thingol hears of a great wolf on the rampage - and two elven hunters chasing it. Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur wouldn&#39;t let the one Silmaril left near them get away, right? All <i>three</i> of them are heading for Doriath.<br><br>So as Carcharoth romps through the forest, Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur go and steal the remaining two Silmarils from Aladdin. That&#39;s when they pull Jafar&#39;s &#39;make me Sultan/make me as powerful as Sauron&#39; thing (and also a &#39;make Jasmine love me&#39;, which is actually a thing Curufin wanted in one of the early versions of the LoL). Aladdin points out that Feanor is still more powerful than them - but that they&#39;re out of wishes. Which means all four of them (plus Huan the Tigerdog) get to go hunt Carcharoth.<br><br>If Feanor is a ghost, do Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur get mortally wounded during the hunt, take the Silmaril between them, wish to &#39;be just like you, dad&#39;, and then promptly die? If you want a happy ending, <i>Beren</i> can&#39;t die, so they can take that role. That leaves Aladdin free to take up the last Silmaril and set Feanor free at last, to go (with his sons!) off into the West and seek some kind of rest.<br><br>Obviously that&#39;s just one option, but I think it shows that it <i>could</i> work.<br><br>~<br><br>Now: what would this do to Arda? First off, you&#39;d very shortly have a Sudden Flame 2.0 as Morgoth comes stomping out (not in person, his feet hurt) to try and get the Silmarils back. I&#39;m trying to get my head round how that war would play out - on the Elves&#39; side, they aren&#39;t at all ready for it, and are still reeling from the last one, but Morgoth isn&#39;t prepared either, and he doesn&#39;t have a traitor in Maedhros&#39; camp like he did at the Unnumbered Tears. With the Host of Angband heading straight for him, Thingol would have to actually send his army out, and between him, Orodreth, Turgon, and Fingon, I think they could pretty much destroy anything Morgoth sends down the Vale of Sirion.<br><br>The east is a different matter. If Morgoth goes that way, the (remaining) Sons of Feanor are going to be pretty battered, and have to withdraw. So in a reverse of the canon, it&#39;s going to be East Beleriand which is overrun, with the dwarves, the Green Elves, and Maedhros fighting a guerilla war, while over in the west, things are relatively okay.<br><br>Once that&#39;s resolved, Maedhros now has a huge grudge against Doriath. Not only do they have <i>all</i> the Silmarils, they also killed (kinda) two of his brothers. In canon, he leaves them be until Luthien dies; I don&#39;t think he&#39;d do the same here. So you get an attempted Second Kinslaying against a Doriath led by Thingol, Melian, Beren, and Luthien (since they didn&#39;t die and wander off to Ossiriand). Again, I have no idea how that would go, but it would be super messy - and of course, with the Feanorians focussed on Doriath, Morgoth would be able to push through their remnant territory and cut around to the south...<br><br>Yeah, I have no idea where this ends up. Earendil crossing the Helcaraxe? Luthien and Melian taking on Morgoth face-to-face? Maedhros making common cause with Angband? Pretty much anything could happen!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well... at the time Morgoth stole the Silmarils Feanor was alive, so maybe Morgoth never actually knew he had what he needed for victory on top of his head...<br><br>but in that case how did Aladdin find out? The only logical way would be for Feanor&#39;s sons to have seen his spirit heading off to Angband when he died... would they have told anyone?<br><br>I think so - maybe they told Thingol in an effort to convince him to attack Morgoth instead of hiding behind the Girdle.<br><br>So... that kind of fits... and talking of the Girdle, I&#39;m not sure the SoFs could get through to speak to Aladdin - unless when the people from Doriath go out to hunt Carcharoth... but I doubt Sultan Thingol would let anyone get away with stealing the Silmarils from his soon-to-be-son-in-law.<br><br>As for what happens to Arda, I imagine that sooner or later Morgoth would come to Doriath himself. I&#39;m not sure Melian and Luthien (err, Jasmine) could hold out against him...<br><br>This happy ending rule seems to be cutting off nearly all the options. <br><br>I think... Morgoth gets in, then Sultan Thingol challenges him to single combat while Melian, Aladdin and Jasmine escape with the Silmarils and everyone evacuates...<br><br>or do the Orcs and Balrogs devastate the city long before that happens?<br><br>If Feanor&#39;s been freed by this stage, the good guys have made a big mistake - that &quot;wish Morgoth to the Timeless Void&quot; thing would really come in handy at this stage...<br><br>I can&#39;t really see Maedhros and Morgoth ever making an alliance - neither of them trust each other one bit, and I think the Oath would still mean they had to take vengeance, even if Morgoth had lost the Silmarils.<br><br>Then, of course, there&#39;s the &quot;maximum chaos&quot; option - once the Girdle&#39;s down but before Morgoth can do anything else, the Feanorians arrive for a massive three-way battle where no-one can decide who they&#39;re meant to be fighting...<br><br>I think I may just have unwittingly doomed the whole of Middle-earth.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Can’t the SoFs just use their new Sauron powers to defeat Carcharoth?<br><br>Did no-one think of wishing Morgoth into the Timeless Void? Because that would save an awful lot of bloodshed... or just focus the hatred of the remaining sons of Feanor onto the other Elves, causing more Kinslaying. <br><br>Would Feanor really want to be set free? Surely even being bound to the Silmarils would be preferable to going to the halls of Mandos?<br><br>Wouldn’t the SoFs get six wishes, three each? Or do they take them together so they don’t end up double-crossing each other?<br><br>Presumably Maedhros wouldn’t be able to get through the Girdle... so a siege of Doriath? That would probably fail, but when Morgoth gets involved the Feanorians would be trapped between two enemies.<br><br>Would Melian let them in (bearing in mind they’ll then try and kill everyone to get to the Silmarils) or leave them to the non-existent mercy of Morgoth?<br><br>Too many questions!</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s the tiger, as Huan was more Luthien&#39;s than Beren&#39;s, but the tiger didn&#39;t have much role in the plot, so maybe flying carpet? Also, I don&#39;t think Middle-earth actually had any of those things, but that&#39;s just a minor detail.<br></p>

            <p>... does that make Finrod the monkey? :D<br><br>And the <s>corpse</s> bat-fell of Thuringwethil the flying carpet?<br><br>DIGRESSION: did Middle-earth have tigers, monkeys, or flying carpets?<br><br><u>Tigers</u>: kinda! <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tevildo">Tevildo</a> was Prince of Cats, and the villain in the original version of the Tale of Tinuviel. He and his court were giant cats, in the same way that Huan is a giant dog; they ended up shrinking to house-cat size when Tevildo&#39;s magic collar was removed. So not tigers <i>per se</i>, but felines on the same scale, yes. (Amusingly, Tevildo&#39;s cook is named Miaulë - &#39;meow-ley&#39;. Tolkien has a strange sense of humour.)<br><br><u>Monkeys</u>: Yes! Specifically in the form of apes (okay, traditionally &#39;monkey&#39; applies to all primates <i>outside</i> the apes, but that&#39;s paraphyletic and I reject it). They first get a mention from Grishnakh the orc, of all people:<br><br><i>&#39;You speak of what is deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Uglúk,&#39; he said. &#39;Nazgûl! Ah! All that they make out! One day you&#39;ll wish that you had not said that. <b>Ape</b>!&#39; he snarled fiercely. &#39;You ought to know that they&#39;re the apple of the Great Eye.</i><br><br>We later get a narrative mention in the battle of the Hornburg:<br><br><i>Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Orcs sprang up them like <b>apes</b> in the dark forests of the South.</i><br><br><u>Flying carpets</u>: Yes! Wait, no. But! Among Tolkien&#39;s drawings are a beautiful pair of Numenorean carpets:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FpWAJFt.png"><br><br>So if he <i>had</i> written about flying carpets, we at least know what they would have looked like. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve ever read the <i>Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>, you&#39;ll have run across <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_210">Letter 210</a>, in which Tolkien comprehensively deconstructs and slams a prospective <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movie script. He pulls no punches, and along the way manages to give us an excellent view of both what <i>he</i> thinks is important in his books - and what <i>Zimmerman</i> thinks is. (They don&#39;t really match up.)<br><br>If this is a genre of letter that interests you, good news! Rick Riordan (<i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i> &amp;c) has just shared his own version:<br><br><a href="http://rickriordan.com/2018/11/memories-from-my-tv-movie-experience/">Memories from my TV/Movie Experience</a>, by Rick Riordan<br><br>Featuring scathing comments on the <i>Lightning Thief</i> movie like:<br><br>&quot;The dialogue needs to sparkle. I’d like to see it be fresh and original and funny. Right now there are some good areas, but mostly it is flat, tired, and uninspired. It’s certainly not funny. I’m not expecting lines to be lifted from the book verbatim, but it would be nice if they resembled the source material at least in tone and spirit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;These kids are the seed audience for the movie. They are the ones who will show up first with their families, then tell their friends to go, or not go, depending on how they liked it. They are looking for one thing: How faithful was the movie to the book? Make Percy seventeen, and that battle is lost before filming even begins.&quot;<br><br>and of course:<br><br>&quot;If the script goes forward in its present form, I don’t need to be the Oracle of Delphi to foresee what will happen. You will lose the fans of the series 100%, but more importantly the script will fail to impress even regular moviegoers who haven’t read the book. The movie will become another statistic in a long line of failed movies badly adapted from children’s books.  No one wants that, and a year from now I really would prefer not to be saying: “I told you so.”&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Ignoring the gods, who have been shown multiple times to not be very picky: Magnus himself is at least bisexual, (and yes, you were right, it was Alex from the books who was genderfluid), Nico di Angelo and Will Solace are gay, there&#39;s a pair of lesbian ex-hunters of Artemis who left so they could be together... and I <i>know</i> I&#39;m missing a lot trying to think of them off the top of my head.<br><br>The Trials of Apollo books have been pretty great throwing Apollo to the front and center narrating them, because he literally does not care and thinks humans are really silly getting hung up on the gender of their partners.

            <p>So, Rick Riordan has been doing this thing called Rick Riordan Presents, which is basically him saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know enough about other culture&#39;s mythology and I don&#39;t want to be disrespectful so I am going to hire and showcase other authors to write about their respective mythologies&quot;. <br><br>The reason I&#39;m mentioning this is because the upcoming showcase novel, Dragon Pearl, was given to me in an advance copy, and having read it, I&#39;d like to recommend it here, and the whole showcase series itself. It&#39;s not Riordan&#39;s writing, but he&#39;s using his name as a way to help build up and promote other authors. I think that&#39;s pretty cool.</p>

            <p>At another discussion board, a topic came up about people losing cooking skills, especially younger generations really now knowing how to cook.  All of my close friends, who are in mid-thirties to mid-forties, are good to great cooks - but there may be a selection bias.  I don&#39;t really know many people who are younger than 30, but I know many PPCers fall into that category.  So, I hope you can prove me right and say that are, in fact, capable of putting together at least one meal that is not takeout/reheating a frozen package. :)</p>

            <p>I live with three other people who are good cooks and actually enjoy cooking, so it&#39;s bit hard to work up the motivation to learn a skill I don&#39;t enjoy. My brother&#39;s teaching me, though, if slowly. I can do a few simple things, oatmeal, potatoes, things on that level. Plus the family pizza recipe. That&#39;s basically a requirement for my household.</p>

            <p>I was actually terrified of breaking down a chicken until I was 30 years old and I had to talk myself into it, reminding myself that if I passed anatomy where it was really important that I don&#39;t cut some tissue, then I surely can cut a chicken when no one cares if it&#39;s not done 100% perfect.  And it turned out to be easy.  I was afraid to cook meat at all until I was 23, too, even though I have been cooking fish since I was 10 or 11. :)</p>

            <p>And as a student and (job-searching diplomee) living alone, I sure hope I can cook, I&#39;d die of hunger otherwise... Or I&#39;d ruin my budget buying kebabs and the likes (seriously, you can get meat and vegetables for four dishes if you spend smart against one kebab costing six Euros).<br><br>I usually use woks, pans or a small oven, and wouldn&#39;t dream of not using fresh vegetables (carrots, courgette or bell pepper, they&#39;re easier to cook. Sometimes with mushrooms) in my dish to go with the meat (usually chicken, it&#39;s cheaper) and rice/couscous/pasta, generally with soy sauce (or tomato sauce, or cream+mustard) and a few spices... I thank my mother&#39;s cooking habits for these skills and habits (I also have a brother who can do pizzas). <br><br>Speaking of her, I remember she talked the fact the idea people ate and cooked better in the past was sort of overblown, with conserves, frozen packages and the likes being all the rage during the 70s and 80s...</p>

            <p>I read a fascinating book about changes in the way people approached eating and cooking, how it started in the early 20th century and gathered steam all the way through 80s when it slowly started to swing back.  So &quot;good old days&quot; of cooking would be 1930s/1940s through maybe 1950s depending on the locale.  And then yes, packaged foods became all the rage.<br><br>My mom cooked pretty much the same as her grandmother so I grew up eating like it was still 19th century. :)  Despite both my parents working long hours, we almost never had a meal that wasn&#39;t 100% made from scratch.  Though we often did eat the same thing 2-3 days in a row (which I know some people hate, but I don&#39;t mind).</p>

            <p>Heck, <i>eating</i> is a waste of time, and I wouldn&#39;t bother with it, except that I literally have to to stay alive.<br><br>But I spend nearly the entire waking portion of my work week either at work, getting ready for work, or feeding myself.  I have no interest in messing around with ovens; they take <i>way</i> too long.  I do use the stove, but only to boil hot dogs for dinner (+ an extra to pack in my lunch for the next shift), or to make my pot of breakfast spaghetti for the week on my first shift day of the week.  (I go in two hours early most days, so I need to pack as much mass into my stomach at the start of the day as possible to make sure my energy lasts to lunch break.)  Otherwise, I&#39;m a microwave man.  Chicken nuggets, frozen pizza, cheese crisps (the gringo kind), whatever hats up the fastest so I can eke out a few precious minutes of internet time between shifts.  I also have tuna and crackers for dinner a lot of nights now, since the high energy cost period was recently changed in Arizona and doesn&#39;t end until 8:00 pm, and I try not to use the microwave before then to save on the electric bill.  I do allow myself to make macaroni and cheese for weekend lunches, since those are the only days I have time to to wash all the dishes that result from that mess.  Food is food, and I don&#39;t care much about quality, fanciness or variety, just so long as it keeps me fed.<br><br>But I would happily cut out eating altogether if I could.  If nothing else, it would allow me to go back up to eight hours of sleep every night instead of seven, which my body sorely needs.<br><br>—since age was brought up, doctorlit is thirty-two</p>

            <p>If I ate the way you do, I would hate eating too. I didn&#39;t use to like eating until I was in my mid-20s, I think, mainly because I grew up on really boring foods - good, but rather plain.  Once exposed to different cuisines from around the world, I discovered the joys of having a great meal.

            <p>Although I must admit, I don’t tend to do much. <br><br>So back in college I worked part time in the kitchens of a bar/restaurant, which gave me a lot of experience cooking, and a bunch of recipes I could take with me when I left.<br><br>My issue these days is just how impractical it is to do anything particularly involved when you’re only cooking for one person: the amount of prep time, the amount of washing up it can generate, and sometimes even just trying to buy the ingredients without having a bunch of stuff go to waste – there’s a lot of stuff that I know how to cook, that just don’t feel like they’re worth doing. <br><br>Still, I try and make sure I only use microwave meals/takeaways once or twice a week. Most of what I do I don’t consider to be ‘proper’ cooking, as it largely just consists of heating different things for slightly different amounts of time (boil some carrots and peas, cheat a little and microwave a pack of rice, serve with some sausages) – no real skill of effort needed, but at the weekends I might do something a bit more involved. <br><br>-Irish</p>

            <p>My approach is to make soups - easy, cheap and makes 4 batches that I either eat for four dinners straight (my lunches all come from the cafeteria at work) or I eat for two meals and freeze the rest in portion-sized containers.  Or making do with single sheet-tray to roast some fish and veggies.  Slow-cooker is good too, to load up in the morning with meat and veggies and come back to dinner that makes 2-3 servings.  I am lucky that most stores near me sell small packages or bulk produce that are enough for just 2-3 meals so I don&#39;t have to buy a huge bag and throw away half of it.</p>

            <p>I mean, it&#39;s OK as a starter, but I don&#39;t really see it as main course. And I&#39;m not overly fond of having the same thing again each day. I&#39;ll do it occasionally just for the economy of cooking/washing, but if I&#39;m doing that I generally just double up on the portions to give myself one extra meal out of it. <br><br>I do sometimes do large amounts of various pasta sauces: eat one straight away, one in the fridge for later in the week, couple in the freezer for the following weeks, but I&#39;ve been tending to cook less pasta for myself, because if I&#39;m going to buy ready meals they tend to be pasta. So if I&#39;m actually cooking pasta too, I&#39;ll occasionally realize that I&#39;ve gone for a week or so just eating pasta (and that realization typically goes hand in hand with the realization for why a bunch of my clothes don&#39;t fit properly any more).<br><br>I get the idea of a slow-cooker, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re perfectly safe, but there&#39;s a part of me that just doesn&#39;t like the idea of leaving food cooking unattended for that length of time. <br><br>For me, it&#39;s just about reducing the hassle of the washing up, so I&#39;m generally looking to cook stuff using a maximum of one pot/pan and one oven tray, which gives a fair amount of scope for variety. <br><br>Oh, and since it was relevant to your initial question, I&#39;m 32, so don&#39;t quite fall in to that younger category now. But my first job in a restaurant was at 16, and I&#39;d been helping with the cooking around the house for years before that, so I&#39;ve kind of always known how to cook. <br><br>-Irish</p>

            <p>Like I mentioned in my reply to Scape below, my mom&#39;s absolutely amazing in the kitchen and she passed her knowledge on to me and my little brother. (My dad&#39;s no slouch as a chef, either, and he taught us some things too, but Mom is usually the one making dinner, so... anyway, rambling.)<br><br>When I moved into my uni dorm, I ended up sharing a flat with five other people. Out of them, only one knew how to make his own meals, and that&#39;s because he&#39;d been living on his own for a while before. <br><br>I taught two of them how to cook and they&#39;ve finally gained enough confidence in the kitchen to start trying new things; one of them has taken a shine to making ham in the slow cooker, the other tried making fresh bread the other day (and it was <i>delicious</i>), and we&#39;ve taken to collaborating on meals. It&#39;s resulted in some strange combinations like horchata, spaghetti, and potatoes, but hey, it tasted good. :P</p>

            <p>I live in a part of the world where it&#39;s very easy to get fresh produce, particularly fish; my local fishmonger operates his own fifteen-boat fleet and once supplied fish to the Queen. Other people don&#39;t have that luxury. There&#39;s the phenomenon of &quot;nutritional deserts&quot;, in which poor people who get paid once a month and therefore have to get food that <i>lasts</i> a month for some reason buy frozen ready meals rather than fresh fruit and vegetables. This is a truly inexplicable state of affairs and is probably to do with how poor people are just too stupid to know what healthy food is, so we&#39;ll send Jamie Oliver in to look mournfully at a chicken nugget and this will solve everything forever.<br><br>Another big part of the lack of cooking skills is the idea that you should be constantly working, all the time, always and forever. Breaks are breaks in productivity and therefore to be not only discouraged but shamed. Not only does nobody have the time to learn how to cook, nobody has the energy <i>to</i> cook. If you&#39;ve done a twelve-hour shift for a pittance of wages that you won&#39;t see for dust come payday&#39;s round of bills and are trying to keep a house in order, you don&#39;t want to run the risk of the household going hungry for a night and/or wasting a load of money by trying and failing to cook something. It&#39;s <i>wasteful</i> to try and cook; wasteful of your time and energy and very limited resources. So you don&#39;t try. You can&#39;t try. And trying only ever hurts you.</p>

I think my home is not warm enough (I usually only feel like baking in the cold time of the year). <br><br>And I have been told slow-cookers are terribly old-fashioned with people going for instant cookers and multi-cookers nowadays, but I love my simple, basic Crockpot with three settings on its only knob. :)</p>

            <p>Namely: preheat your oven to 200°F, then turn it off and put your bread dough in to rise. That gets around having a cooler kitchen.<br><br>Knowing very little about bread machines, I assume yours does something similar, but at any rate, here&#39;s the lower-tech version :)<br><br>As for slow-cookers--I don&#39;t have one myself, but I watch a lot of recipe videos, and they seem to be really popular right now. Including for making things like monkey-bread and other desserts, which seems a bit strange to me, but it&#39;s certainly creative. I suppose I could be mistaking them for the other types you mentioned, but as far as I remember, the devices in the videos were referred to as slow-cookers, so I&#39;m running with that.<br><br>Anyway. If you love yours, then current trends don&#39;t matter anyway :) My family has a Vitamix that&#39;s older than I am and works splendidly.<br><br>What&#39;s your favorite thing to make in your slow-cooker? <br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Yep, bread machine does warm up the mix to make it rise better.  And it can bake it too - mine has 8 different settings for different dough types, and you can always stop anything at the dough stage and just take it out and bake on your own.  Or let the machine do its thing.  My parents have been using one to bake bread - they would bake a loaf every other day or so - for years, my Mom is now on her fourth or fifth one...<br><br>My favorite slow-cooker meal is pulled pork!  And I have made my own sauce for it - I was stuck with two gallons of frozen aronia so I have been experimenting with it in many different ways.  One was a barbecue type sauce that was an utter failure as a sauce to smother already cooked meat, but works amazing as a marinade/cooking sauce for that same meat.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;m starting this thread so all the inevitable discussion regarding Fantastic Beasts:  Crimes of Grindelwald can be kept under a single heading.  While there are no spoilers in my post, please be aware that there will probably be spoilers, so make sure you have spoiler tags ready to go.<br><br>First thoughts:  If you haven&#39;t already before seeing Crimes of Grindelwald watch the first Fantastic Beasts again, things make much more sense in both films when watched in conjunction.  <br><br>It was a good movie and I highly recommend it.  Though there are a few areas that I think will open up healthy debate.  </p>

            <p>I actually liked this movie, and I am going to reserve my judgement on any plot twists/developments/inconsistencies until all of the movies (five now?  that feels like an overkill, but OK) are out.  <br><br>I used up all of my snarking on the abomination that is Peter Jackson&#39;s films about Middle-earth, so I have none left for other movie-verses.  Besides, I never got much into Harry Potter.  I did like the first Fantastic Beasts film a lot, though, so I was looking forward to this one.  Definitely don&#39;t regret the time I spent watching it and I will definitely rewatch when it comes out on DVD. </p>

Before I start really ranting, I just want to say that visually, the movie was very nice and the special effects were breathtaking. <br><br>That being said: the vast majority of the plot was just sort of pushed aside in favor of special effects. <br><br>I say plot, but it can really be boiled down to &quot;There&#39;s a secret Lestrange and we promise this is important! Hahaha, just kidding, you wasted two hours of your life on this because it doesn&#39;t actually matter at all!&quot;<br><br>All I can say about the ending is that Grindelwald had better be lying off his ass about Credence being a secret <i>Dumbledore</i> instead, because I literally facepalmed as the credits rolled.<br><br>Professor McGonagall was also a teacher. At Hogwarts. Eight years before she was born.<br><br>Dumbledore&#39;s refusal to fight Grindelwald being the result of a blood pact rather than his reluctance to duel his old friend-slash-crush was also eyeroll-worthy.<br><br>And Nagini being a human woman who doesn&#39;t pass the Sexy Lamp test (&quot;Can you replace this character with a lamp and the plot stays the same?&quot;) was its own level of cringe. Yes, that Nagini. Voldemort&#39;s snake used to be a person. I just... I can&#39;t.<br><br>And all of that is before I get into my now intense, deep-seated and utter <i>loathing</i> for Queenie after her date-rape drugging Jacob into agreeing to marry her, and then it&#39;s treated like it&#39;s <i>Jacob&#39;s</i> fault for forcing her to do that to him. Yeah, sure, she joined Grindelwald (because... he promises to let wizards and Muggles live in peace. Hey, remember that part where she&#39;s a Legillimens? Because apparently Rowling doesn&#39;t. Even if Grindelwald was using Occlumency to shield his thoughts from her, there&#39;s no way she&#39;s missing what all of his followers are thinking and I just AUGH.) and is probably going to get a redemption arc so she and Jacob can be reunited and he can apologize to her for not wanting to marry her. <br><br>He even called it out for what it was: &quot;When were you going to stop, Queenie? After we&#39;d had five kids?&quot; and she doesn&#39;t deny it. Jesus <i>Christ</i> almighty, if it had been a male character doing that to a female character, nobody in the theater would have been laughing like they were.<br><br>So yeah. After how good the first <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> movie was, this one wasn&#39;t just a disappointment. It only barely ranks above <i>Cursed Child</i> for its godawful characterization, disregard for canon, and lazy plot that goes nowhere.</p>

I have a vague impression that there are too many characters, probably due to the filmmakers reaching too far for cameos of names we recognize. Such as Nagini. I don&#39;t mind her backstory being that she was a woman with a blood-curse, but seriously, why is she involved in this story? It had better pay off later.<br><br>I also have a sense that we&#39;re following the wrong protagonist? I mostly like Newt, but I have no idea why he&#39;s our guy. Like... what is his arc here? He finally decides to take a side after seeing what Grindelwald is like in person? Okay, but... what did he actually do? What lesson has he learned? Why is this HIS story and not, say, Credence&#39;s? He&#39;s the one with real skin in the game, real stakes to win or lose. Newt&#39;s motivation is, there&#39;s a girl he likes and also Dumbledore gave him a side-quest to find and protect Credence. The thing with the blood-pact bauble was a lucky opportunity; I&#39;m not sure he knew about it ahead of time. Dumbledore certainly seemed surprised to see it at the end.<br><br>I don&#39;t mind the blood-pact, incidentally, because it seems like the kind of grand gesture two young guys on an epic quest for power and glory might well make to each other in a fit of zeal. I&#39;m sure Dumbledore meant it at the time, and may even be reluctant to break it now. The Mirror of Erised scene shows us he clearly still has feelings for Grindelwald, or at least that was my reading. The moment they made that pact was the moment they were closest to each other, and that is &quot;nothing more or less than the deepest desire of his heart.&quot; Poor bugger.<br><br>... Maybe Tina would make a better protagonist. She&#39;s an auror, it could be a whole international detective thing with Newt being this weird guy who keeps turning up on seemingly innocent premises and yet mucks things up and/or helps her in oddly coincidental ways. Like, he&#39;s nice enough, maybe she&#39;s even attracted to him, but what is his deal, and what is his connection with the elusive Dumbledore? It could&#39;ve been an interesting mystery from her point of view.<br><br>Once again, Jacob is more or less luggage. His motivation is also there&#39;s a girl he likes, whose treatment of him is awful and definitely needed to be called out more strongly. If they&#39;re setting her up to go to the Dark Side, fine, that&#39;s definitely a red flag. That shit is illegal, not to mention immoral. But Team Good Guy just kinda let it slide. {= /<br><br>I don&#39;t know why we need him and Queenie. They don&#39;t get enough development for me to care that much about them, and I&#39;m certainly not rooting for them as a couple after that. I guess Grindelwald has a really good Legillimens now, but he could&#39;ve had that anyway. Her story might&#39;ve been better as something discovered in the course of tracking down Grindelwald through his lackeys or something like that.<br><br>... I&#39;m liking Tina as protag more and more.<br><br>Really, who else actually did things actively to advance the plot? I feel like Grindelwald was pulling the strings the whole time and everything has basically gone according to plan.<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got now. Perhaps more once I&#39;ve had more time to process it and absorb other people&#39;s thoughts.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I agree that her actions regarding Jacob and the Love Potion were not good.  Very Merope Gaunt (more on that later).  Regarding the Legillimens issues a few things:<br><br>1. In Fantastic Beasts, while it was shown to be quite strong with regards to Newt and Jacob, but keep in mind that she did not deduce that Graves was Grindelwald nor that Abernathy was working with Grindelwald. <br>2. She wasn&#39;t really around Grindelwald&#39;s followers that were not in his immediate presence.  It is very possible that those who were part of his Apartment team were skilled with Occlumency.  <br>3.  By the time the Graveyard scene happened she was already lost and probably very much wearing blinders.  She did not want to know.  She does seem to be very singular minded.<br><br>On to the Blood Pact.  It could be an interesting plot device, and I think it works.  Because while reluctance is certainly a good reason, it could still come into play.  Remember there are about 20 years between Crimes of Grindelwald and when Dumbledore fights Grindelwald.  I suspect Dumbledore will have dissolved the pact by the end of the next film, which gives two additional movies with Dumbledore on the sidelines deciding how and when to fight.<br><br>Lestrange.  So I thought it could have been handled better, but early on Leta at least made it clear that Credence was not her half-brother.  She affirmed to Dumbledore that Credence was not Corvinus. <br><br>Now as to Credence being a Dumbledore...Grindelwald was probably lying.  It does not fit with the actual canon timeline (though they are kind of playing fast and loose with that, maybe).  I think it is possible that Credence could theoretically be from Honoria Dumbledore&#39;s side of the family, but I think more likely Grindelwald was lying.  After all he was noted as being manipulative.  Given that Grindelwald did not know Credence was the Obscurus until he tried to kill him, I don&#39;t think that he knows who Credence is (after all CoG is only a few months after FB).<br><br>As to McGonagall, in film I do not recall her being addressed as Minerva McGonagall though it is listed as such in the credits.  But as to date, I was checking Pottermore again and there is no year listed for her Birthday.  I think the 1935 number was extrapolated and Rowling has messed up on math before (remember Flint attending Hogwarts for 8 years).  So as far as I know it does not directly contradict anything in the existing books.<br><br>Nagini as a maledictus cursed to turn into a snake.  I&#39;m actually alright with that.  Nagini was always portrayed with near human intelligence, and the ability to disguise herself as a woman.  I think it is passable, but they have a long way to explain how she goes from the Good Guys to Voldermort&#39;s Companion.  There are also at least three more movies to explain that.  <br><br>As to Crazy Theories, which I expect none of them to be true, but if they are I want to be able to say I told you so.<br><br>1. Queenie&#39;s Role.  My theory was originally that Queenie was really Merope Gaunt, but as I was checking timelines again, I realized that Tom Riddle was already born by the time CoG starts.  But I&#39;ll stick with Queenie is still a Gaunt, just descended from the Irish-American Line through Martha Gaunt. <br><br>2. Credence&#39;s Identity.  My theory was originally that he was actually  a young Tom Riddle, given his affinity with Nagini, Powerful Dark Magic, Hatred of Muggles, and a Growing Dislike of Dumbledore, but it appears that once again the time lines just do not synchronize.  Then I was going to try to make some extreme argument that he was really Tom Riddle Senior, but again given that in canon Tom Riddle was born in 1926 that does not seem viable, not to mention the whole Riddle Senior was a muggle.  So yeah I got a whole lot of nothing here.  It is unlikely that he is a Dumbledore, because of the simple fact that he would have had to have been born in Azkaban and I&#39;m fairly certain Dementors did not allow that kind of visit.   </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know one way or the other, but when I read Rick Riordan&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://rickriordan.com/2018/11/memories-from-my-tv-movie-experience/">Memories from my TV/Movie Experience</a>&quot; blog post, Rowling is who I thought of at the line &quot;Even the most powerful authors (yes, the ones you are thinking of right now) have WAY less influence and control than you think they do.&quot;<br><br>Also, she may not <i>want</i> much say. As I recall, Rowling stated that she was done with the Harry Potter universe once the seven books were finished. Maybe she changed her mind for <i>Fantastic Beasts</i>, if the ideas came to her and she was excited about them... but I wonder if it&#39;s more likely that people (fans and/or movie people who own some of the rights) have just been putting so much pressure on her for more Wizarding World content that she gave in and agreed to sign off on whatever.<br><br>Again, I don&#39;t KNOW anything. These are just the thoughts that are rattling around in my brain as I see the films and read the commentary.<br><br>Does anyone have any actual information that might illuminate us?<br><br>Also, has anyone read any of her more recent, non-HP work? That would be a good place to look and see what her writing quality is like these days.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Did you catch the furore over her Wizarding in North America stuff? It was probably a couple of years back now. It wasn&#39;t... <i>spectacular</i> worldbuilding.<br><br>It could have been. I played around with a few ideas suggested by it: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=300270">Wands Are Not Ethical</a>, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=296770;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Ilvermorny houses</a> (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298748;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Part 2</a>), <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298919;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">American wandmaking</a>, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298857;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">President Pickles</a>, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=301868;search_term=the+rap">a sympathetic view of MACUSA</a>.

            <p>And it might just be the consequence of the fact that France was just next door to England compared to America&#39;s novelty, and so it was assumed that things were similar, and some things were already written, like Beauxbatons, and totally not a &#39;burn&#39; reaction from Rowlings, but... <br><br>Now I&#39;m thinking and searching about it, I can&#39;t help but notice that French Wizardry World didn&#39;t seemingly get near the amount of world-building which got into the US one before the movie got out... <br><br>And on that same vein, the fact the action just happens to move away from the wonderfully nice Friend MACUSA and his mandatory happiness...</p>

            <p>Disclaimer: Phobos had no trouble with it, so it might just be me.<br><br>However, I was occasionally very confused about which side of the statue-lady&#39;s skirt we were on.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Per <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/collection/wizarding-schools">Pottermore</a>, there are eleven main wizarding schools. If you don&#39;t live in a country with its own school (or within a school&#39;s primary intake area), you are probably either home-schooled, or taught by correspondence course. One assumes that Muggle-borns tend to be grabbed by whatever the nearest school is, even if it&#39;s several countries away. There are also non-approved schools, which Pottermore gives only a passing mention to.<br><br>Given that J.K. Rowling is a clear Hogwarts Exceptionalist, the documents written by her have a certain... <i>incompleteness</i> when it comes to the other schools. That, of course, means there&#39;s a huge opportunity here for wild speculation! Everything that follows is either direct from Rowling via the Pottermore link, or sheer invention on my part. ^_^<br><hr>
<br><u>Hogwarts</u>: (Intake: British Isles) Hogwarts was a compromise which pleased none of the Founders. Hufflepuff originally floated the idea of a central magical location which wizards from all the warring factions of Britain could gather in, but the other three were the ones who insisted on making it a school. Ravenclaw wanted a research establishment, Slytherin wanted to teach practical magic - and Gryffindor wanted a combat academy.<br><br><u>Beauxbatons</u>: (Intake: Europe west of Germany &amp; north of Switzerland) The Triwizard Tournament was originally founded to try and stave off war between Hogwarts and Beauxbatons after the English possessions in France were taken by the French. (The situation was made even more complicated by the fact that Scotland was allied with France, but Hogwarts was mainly English.) It was repeatedly cancelled due to wars and outbreaks of nationalism between the two; the 1792 cancellation was intended to be temporary, but after Napoleon&#39;s rise to power in France, it remained in place due to tensions between the schools which amounted to outright hatred.<br><br><u>Durmstrang</u>: (Intake: Scandinavia, Eastern Europe) The reason for the tension between Durmstrang and the other European schools is simple: Durmstrang was in the Eastern Bloc, and fell under Soviet influence (partly due to its hatred of Grindelwald the Wizard Fascist). Igor Karkaroff was hated for many reasons, but one was that he was the first non-Communist head of the school in nearly a century.<br><br><u>Koldovstoretz</u>: (Intake: Russia) Koldovstoretz is known from an ancillary text, but isn&#39;t shown on the map of schools. The reason for this is simple: nobody knows where it&#39;s gone. It went into hiding during the Russian Revolution of 1917, and has never come back out. (This may sound absurd, but their students play Quidditch on entire trees; they&#39;re used to moving large objects around.)<br><br><u>Uagadou</u>: [Intake: all Africa, purportedly] Uagadou is not actually a school: it is a city, the capital of the only independent wizarding nation in the world, that just happens to <i>contain</i> a school. The fact that this is not acknowledged is due to a long-term, deeply racist trend of diminishing the achievements of African wizards, in an effort to brush over the fact that they were the founders of magic; see for example Rowling&#39;s characterization of Uagadou students as unruly and mischievous.<br><br>There are actually multiple other large, famous, and ancient African schools - but the International Confederation of Wizards refuses to acknowledge them, for much the same reasons. Supreme Mugwump Akingbade has tried to change this, but been stymied by bureaucratic stubbornness.<br><br><u>Ilvermorny</u>: (Intake: North America) While theoretically drawing from the entire continent, Ilvermorny barely receives any students from outside the MACUSA heartlands in the US north-east and west coast. Canadian parents don&#39;t see why their children should be bound by MACUSA laws (such as wand registration), wizards from the US south have been in low-key rebellion against the MACUSA government for centuries, and families from Central America would rather send their kids to Castelobruxo.<br><br><u>Castelobruxo</u>: (Intake: Theoretically South America) Castelobruxo actually gets most of its students from Central America, because of its legacy of conquest. The school was actually founded in Yucatan by the Maya, then taken over by Aztec (Mexica, rather) wizards a couple of hundred years later. When the Spanish came to conquer Central America, Castelobruxo moved south - and established itself in the Amazon by force, demanding that native South American wizards submit to their &#39;far superior&#39; magic setup. Throw in the later effects of Portuguese colonization, and you end up with a school that&#39;s in constant tension with its own local population.<br><br><u>Mahoutokoro</u>: (Intake: Japan) Mahoutokoro is actually an exercise in deceit. Every aspect of it - from &#39;oh, we love this Quidditch you&#39;ve taught us&#39; to &#39;our students fly to school on birds&#39; to &#39;ooh, cherry wood wands are the <s>most stereotypical</s> BEST!&#39; - has been designed to trick Westerners into dismissing it as a cute little school that&#39;s not worth worrying about. What they&#39;re actually up to is anyone&#39;s guess.<br><br><u>The Missing Three</u>: There are three other schools that have never been mentioned, and much like Koldovstoretz&#39;s exclusion from the map, this is absolutely deliberate. Here&#39;s the story:<br><br>-The Chinese School, despite being almost as large as Uagadou, has been in a state of feud with the international wizarding community for decades. They openly flout the International Statute of Secrecy, and have been directly involved in multiple revolutions in China, including the Communist Revolution.<br><br>-The Tibetan School, which served wizards as far away as India, was destroyed by Chinese soldiers during the conquest of Tibet in 1951. Many of its teachers and students escaped, and have established an educational network across southern Asia. The name is maintained on the list of the Eleven, both in defiance against the Muggles who burned it, and in the hope that it will one day be restored.<br><br>-The Australian School is known to exist, because wizards from as far away as South-East Asia and Polynesia claim to be graduates from there. But as far as anyone can make out, it exists in another plane of reality entirely; its graduates all come out as devoted mystics, and just insist that they learned their magic in the Dreamtime.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m damn excited, needless to say. I feel like my tastes in speculative fiction, especially of the weirder variety, were all spawned from this.

            <p>I do like the weirder fantasy settings like this - I think when I discovered them I&#39;d been reading a lot more &#39;grown up&#39; fantasy where things like politics, economics and logistics were a heavy part of the setting, so these books were a real breath of fresh air. <br><br>My other go-to series for &#39;fantastical fantasy&#39; is the Edge Chronicles; are you familiar with those? They&#39;re intended for younger readers again, and feature skypirates and all manner of weird and wonderful creatures - and the artwork in the books is just stunning!<br><br>Yeah, the designs of the cities they show off in the trailer look incredible. One thing that didn&#39;t match my expectations is the designs of the aircraft. I&#39;m pretty sure that in the books they always refer to them as &#39;airships&#39;, so I&#39;ve always pictured them as being sort of zeppelin/blimp-like, but these seem to be more sci-fi winged/hover (anti-grav?) designs - which I actually think looks far cooler than what I was picturing before.<br><br>Yeah, I think Hester was always the main character in the sense that the story is about what happened to her, but was often told from the point of view of the people around her. <br><br>-Irish<br><br> </p>

            <p>I ended up spiralling far into Weird Fiction, with Lovecraft (specifically his Dream Cycle stuff, which read more like bizarre fantasy stories) and China Mieville and John Langan and all. <br><br>Ahhh, and is it fantastic! It really did define my favourite stuff. Like you said--an absolutely ridiculous concepts, played totally straight, just all being cool and fun. <br><br>I recall, I think, weren&#39;t a few aircraft more sci-fiey hovery things? Alongside a few blimp fellas? <br><br>But, honestly, I think the cities are perfect. London is <i>brilliant</i> looking. Fits how I saw it perfectly. What a goddamn brilliant image, hey, the sort of, recognisable buildings atop all that industrial crunching mess?<br><br>I think, even if the movie is sort of, written as a mess, the visuals, at least, will ensure it&#39;s a grand old viewing experience. </p>

            <p>And the trailer has managed to convince me to buy the book. It looks... like the sort of story where Peter Jackson&#39;s hallmark over-the-top work will be put to very good use.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s actually 4 books in the series (plus apparently a prequel trilogy that I&#39;ve only just found out about).<br><br>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read them, so I&#39;m not completely sure, but I&#39;ve got a feeling that of the original books the first 3 are a trilogy, and then the 4th one is a little bit separated - after a time skip, or focusing on a wider set of characters or something? But still following on the world and events from the previous stories. <br><br>So yeah, if you enjoyed the first book I definitely  recommend the others. I&#39;m just hoping that this first film does well enough for them to do the whole set. It should do - the trailer looks brilliant, but as evidenced by the Rick Riordan discussion further down the page, adaptations can be a bit hit and miss. <br><br>-Irish</p>

            <p>((Spoilers down to &#39;Kerblam!&#39; lie ahead.))<br><br>Spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler<br><br>Hey Doctor, it&#39;s me, Morgan; we met that time with the evil meatloaf, you probably don&#39;t remember. <i>Any</i>way, I&#39;ve been following your most recent series, and I have a fairly serious concern. To whit: <i>why do you keep letting people die</i>?<br><br>I&#39;m not talking about Grace back in <i>The Woman Who Fell To Earth</i>; you couldn&#39;t do anything about that, and you worked hard to save people. And nobody died in <i>The Ghost Monument</i>, though you certainly walked through a lot of previous death - and discussion of genocide elsewhere - without feeling like maybe you should do something about it. But then things started to go off-piste.<br><br>&#39;Rosa&#39;? You did a whole rant about how terrible guns are, then had absolutely no problem with your buddy Ryan shooting a guy into the undefined distant past.<br><br>&#39;Arachnids in the UK&#39;? You let the giant spider die. I can think of a million ways you could&#39;ve saved it - take it to a planet or time with higher oxygen levels, to name but one! - but you sat there looking sad while it suffocated slowly to death.<br><br>&#39;The Tsuranga Conundrum&#39;? I mean, you did all right, but isn&#39;t the fact that an emergency medical organisation wires their ambulances to explode maybe slightly concerning to you? That looks like a wrong that needs righting to me.<br><br>&#39;Demons of the Punjab&#39;... why did Prem have to die, exactly? The only answer you&#39;ve got is &#39;because Yaz has never heard of him&#39;, but couldn&#39;t you come up with some way to save him <i>and</i> preserve the timeline? You did in Pompeii, and later regenerated into Peter Capaldi to remind yourself of that! I get that you were worried about this turning out like Rose and her dad, but by the end of that episode Pete <i>knew</i> he was sacrificing himself. Prem was just trying to talk his brother down, and given his non-threatening attitude, I don&#39;t even know why the (Hindu! Like him!) rider shot him. Even if you didn&#39;t want to interfere in the Partition - not even one tiny bit - you could definitely have saved his life.<br><br>But that pales in comparison to &#39;Kerblam!&#39;, where - I&#39;m sorry, Doctor - you went full-on corporate shill. Let&#39;s review the ending of your adventure there:<br><br>-You unilaterally support the computer which killed a woman just to make a point.<br>-You let the mega-corporation get away with only paying their staff for <i>half</i> of their <i>minumum</i> estimate for the length of the shutdown. Two weeks paid leave for a month&#39;s maintenance? That&#39;s exploitation!<br>-And - oh yeah - you <i>deliberately killed a man</i>.<br><br>Because let&#39;s not mince words - that&#39;s exactly what you did. You let the man you outnumbered, what, four to one? Five? Run down into a room full of bombs. And then you - you, Doctor, quite deliberately - set those bombs off. You didn&#39;t have to. There was <i>no</i> benefit to you from ordering the robots to open the parcels rather than just making them stand there holding them. You just wanted to kill an angry young working-class man.<br><br>I get that you&#39;re trying to be non-interventionist these days. I can&#39;t say I get <i>why</i> - that&#39;s the sort of message they spout on Gallifrey, which you ran away from, remember? - but I get it. And I&#39;m sure you use that to justify letting innocent creatures and people die, and allowing corporations to exploit their workers. But how - <b>how</b>, Doctor? - do you use it to justify cold-blooded murder?<br><br>-Sincerely,<br><br>Morgan, Tigereye Castellan of the Continuity Council of Gallifrey-in-Exile</p>
