        <div class="post-body">
            <p>So, some time ago, a discussion here on the Board led to the suggestion that the PPC Constitution needed updating. A few of us (hereafter the Anonymous Constitutional Convention, since I can&#39;t remember who exactly helped out) took a look at it, and hashed out a revised set of Articles designed to reflect the PPC as it exists today, including both Board and Chat as equal parts - but not writing rules specifically for the Chat, because they have many more.<br><br>One offshoot of this project was the Permission Self-Check, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=224756;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">already posted</a>. The other is this:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM/edit">The Revised PPC Constitution</a><br><br>At present the Revised Constitution has been drafted, but (of course) remains unratified. So - members of the PPC, is this a Constitution you can support? Are there any problems with it - anything it says which is incorrect, anything which isn&#39;t in there which needs to be, any (gulp) actual mistakes?<br><br>(To anticipate a few questions: yes, it will be signable. No, this is not the final home of the Revised Constitution - it will probably live on the Wiki, with a version elsewhere as backup. Yes, asking where to find the original Constitution to compare it to will result in mocking - it&#39;s at the top of the Board. And no, no pie will be provided to ratifiers)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And I would be prepared to sign it, however there is one passage which causes me some concern, and that is the exact wording of Point 19.<br><br>It may just be that the term Mary Sue means different things to each of us, but I&#39;m not sure why, if it&#39;s possible to remove the &#39;bad&#39; from bad slash (creating good slash), it&#39;s not possible to remove the &#39;badly written&#39; from a Mary Sue, thus creating a &#39;good&#39; Sue. <br><br>The comment of &#39;good Mary-Sues&#39; being a contradiction in terms would seem to ignore the existence of the Canonical Canon Sues, such as Drizzt and the rest: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Canon_Sue"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Canon_Sue">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Canon_Sue</a></a> <br><br>Given that it is acknowledged in the FAQ For Other People (about 2/3 of the way down) that the term &#39;Mary Sue&#39; has come to mean different things to different people, and that the PPC has its own official definition, I also think it would be worth linking to the Mary Sue wiki page in the Constitution. </p>

            <p>Well, although I understand and possibly agree with your concern, I&#39;d like to find a better solution than linking to the Wiki - taking a semi-permanent document that&#39;s supposed to be Written In... Something for the PPC, and linking it to something that Anyone Can Edit strikes me as counter-productive.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I see your point, and I think I can see good reasons both For and Against linking to the Wiki.<br><br>Now that I&#39;ve thought about it some more, I think that I would actually be Against putting the Mary Sue link in there, if for no other reason than, as something that we&#39;re going to sign, having aspects of the Constitution be editable afterwards doesn&#39;t strike me as a good idea either. <br><br>The links that are in there already are more for helping newbies navigate around (such as the ones to the Wiki and the Original Series), and the specific pages linked, like the Permission one, seem unlikely to ever be as controversial as what exactly makes a Mary Sue. Also, trying to include all of the relevant details of something like the Permission article without just having the link to it, would probably end up making the Constitution a fairly unwieldy document. <br><br>Personally, I like the idea of updating the Constitution, because I think it is a great shame that new people currently can&#39;t add their name in support of it.   <br><br><i>(Also, after re-reading my initial post, I think it seems rather abrupt. That wasn&#39;t my intention at all, and if it did seem rude to anyone, then I apologise.)</i><br></p>

            <p>I have reminded myself and reminded myself to bring this up, but I kept frickin&#39; forgetting:<br><br>What is the policy for what happens when rules are broken? &#39;Cause that should be in there, too.<br><br>The clearest thing we&#39;ve got is that trolls will be mocked, but what about other stuff? I mean, in most cases rule-breaking will result in someone saying &quot;Hey, you&#39;re breaking a rule, please stop,&quot; and the offender will go &quot;Oh! Okay, sorry,&quot; but every so often someone will go &quot;What? No I&#39;m not. How could I possibly be breaking that rule when it specifically says &#39;fish&#39; and I was doing &#39;crab,&#39; which is not a fish at all.&quot; Or they&#39;ll go &quot;Oh, okay, sorry,&quot; but then keep doing it.<br><br>So at what point do actual sanctions happen, and what should—heck, what <i>can</i> they be? Frankly, with the Board being un-modded, we don&#39;t have a lot to work with aside from gradual shunning. This tends to work, but it would be nice to be able to come out and say &quot;No, you&#39;ve gone too far now, and so [sanction happens].&quot; That way it&#39;s clear, it&#39;s clean, it&#39;s over quickly. Also, supposing we have another case like Doctor Hello, it would be good not to have to count on them agreeing to go away because we ask them to.<br><br>Quick note to people who hate the suggestion of authority: I&#39;m not proposing mods here. I&#39;m proposing, in the absence of mods, that we all have some publicly known and agreed-upon recourse in the face of flagrant misbehavior.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Maybe if someone breaks a rule, they could be excluded from certain events? <br><br>For example: Sweater Guy gets upset with Crab Fish because Crab Fish is being rude. Sweater Guy starts being rude back, instead of responding appropriately. They get into an argument, and soon other boarders come in and tell them to knock it off. They do, but there&#39;s still needs to be a punishment so it wont happen again.<br><br>Sweater Guy has permission and goes on the chat often. Crab Fish goes on the chat, but doesn&#39;t have his permission yet.<br><br>So, maybe Crab Fish will have to wait another few weeks before trying to get permission, while Sweater Guy could be banned from the chat for a few days. Also, they might not be allowed to join in on any role plays or other events.</p>

            <p>That doesn&#39;t make sense or is appropriate as a punishment, in either case.<br><br>For one, permission is something everyone should have the right to, if they actually meet the requirements. A one off incident should not remove their right to ask for permission.<br><br>For two, the PGs are not mods, weapons, tools, or cooking utensils to be used to be flung at people&#39;s heads in a violent way. (That said, someone who is repeatedly a terrible jerk before they get permission is probablyy not going to be permission because we do not need terrible jerks writing PPC missions because we try to minimize the &#39;the PPC is made up of terrible jerks&#39; thing as far as the spin-offs go.) <br><br>For the third, if it took place on the board, why is SG being banned from the channel? If SG behaves normally pretty much all the time in the channel, does it make it fair to forcefully remove SG from the channel? <br><br>Fourth, we don&#39;t have RPs that often. And everyone is welcome to join in on those unless otherwise stated.<br><br>Fifth, events are permission only, if PPC-wise, and I understand what you mean correctly, so the other person couldn&#39;t take part anyways.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like it set out that it is expected and encouraged that members of the community should speak up if someone is breaking a rule, and not leave it for &quot;someone else&quot; (which has tended to mean PGs more than it ought).

            <p>Yo!<br><br>I was thinking about maybe having a pair of pony agents in addition to my main team, but I wanted to get some feedback first. (I was also considering making them free-to-use agents, but I don&#39;t know the protocol for that, so I&#39;ll just slink back into the woodwork and you can forget I ever brought it up, how&#39;s that.)<br><br><b>Daisy Fields</b><br><br>Daisy Fields (Daisy for short) is an Earth Pony with a mellow, cheerful disposition. She enjoys peace and quiet, but the occasional excitement is nice, too. Daisy is the type of filly to sit back and watch the clouds, maybe sipping some a cool drink, but she&#39;s also extremely friendly and enjoys relaxing even more when there&#39;s a friend around. She almost never gets angry, but she also has a hard time understanding when others get angry or otherwise emotional. Daisy doesn&#39;t often express emotion other than the calm happiness that she constantly exudes. Despite her constant laid-back demeanor, Daisy can be extremely stubborn and resiliant under pressure, and isn&#39;t afraid of much.<br><br>Daisy is a fan of Harry Potter, Black Butler, Fullmetal Alchemist, Doctor Who, and Uglies. Her only Object of Lust is Neville Longbottom.<br><br>Daisy has a yellow-and-white mane in a loose ponytail, a pale yellow coat, and her cutie mark is three daisies. Her special talent is gardening.<br><br><b>Sketchpad</b><br><br>Sketchpad is a shy unicorn with a love of all sorts of art-music, writing, painting, you name it. She loves to spend time at museums and galleries, learning about famous artists and composers. Sketchpad is an extremely empathetic and kind pony who often ends up being the mediator for debates. She has the ability to see both sides of an arguement and suggest the perfect compromise. Despite this, Sketchpad hates being in the middle and hates fighting even more. She doesn&#39;t particularly enjoy socializing and usually prefers to read a good book or paint a landscape. Surprisingly, Sketchpad enjoys action-packed books and shows, and almost never bothers with slice-of-life or intellectual ones. <br><br>Sketchpad is a fan of Young Wizards, Soul Eater, The Hunger Games, Pandora Hearts, and BBC&#39;s Sherlock. Her Objects of Lust are Benedict Cumberbatch, Franken Stein, Peeta, and Finnick.<br><br>Sketchpad is a dusty blue-gray pony with a darker blue mane and braided tail. Her cutie mark is a paper and pencil, and her special talent is drawing. <br><br>Concrit is appreciated... I keep feeling like I missed something here...</p>

            <p>Also, I&#39;m not sure if they, well, fit in the PPC. A mellow, constantly calm pony and someone who focuses on compromise and hates fighting? <br><br>Not that I&#39;m against ponies in general, or that I believe pony Agents cannot be made to work, but I&#39;m not quite sure if pony Agents can be made to work with this sort of personality. Can you imagine running a Mission with these agents? If not, they may not work for one of the Action Departments. Of course, it&#39;s possible you meant them for one of the other departments, in which case you&#39;re doing fine.<br><br>If you did mean them to act as active members, then maybe this is what they were like before the PPC? Maybe tweak their initial characters a bit and add a spoonful of HQ-brand crazy and this could go somewhere!</p>

Given the nature of the Message, and in keeping with the end of White Swans and Black, I&#39;m tempted to just use my own agents for Flight, and let anyone who&#39;s had their imagination captured by the Message use it to further their <i>own</i> story, rather than simply tack it onto one of mine.<br><br>Or maybe I&#39;m overthinking it.

            <p>... the DIO is and has always been mine. I never intended to let anyone else use it - it&#39;s way too dangerous (note that its sole purpose is to kill PPC characters, which, er, yes) - and I don&#39;t intend to use it again. Since no PPC agents should ever have been aware of the existence of the DIO, I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;d be cherry-picking.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I thought I remembered seeing something on the Wiki about a Department that wasn&#39;t for use by everyone, and had a vague feeling that it might have been one of yours, but wghen I went and checked I couldn&#39;t find any evidence for that. <br><br>The reason that I mention this is that in my Permission Request (a week or so back), I said that one of my agents was a former DIO member, and had been neuralyzed upon leaving. I&#39;d been intending on doing at least some character development interludes involving the DIO (and generally about the past that my agent had been made to forget).<br><br>I would have contacted you for permission/guidance before doing anything involving the DIO directly, seeing as it is very different from DMS, Bad Slash, etc., but presumably you&#39;d prefer it if I simply removed this aspect of the character?<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not entirely sure they even do that (Peter strongly implies his previous partner died, and there don&#39;t appear to be any other members of the DIO out there), and if they did they&#39;d do a <i>very</i> thorough job - their whole existence is a secret, since a) they kill agents and b) that kind of sounds like the DIS, who aren&#39;t exactly popular in these parts.<br><br>I guess it depends what you planned on doing. When I say I&#39;m keeping a tight grip on the DIO, I meant mostly their missions. See... [Ramble]<br><br>The DIO was created years ago when we had an influx of people on the Board who said &#39;Hi, I&#39;m InsertNameHere, and here&#39;s my PPC story! It&#39;s about Agent Sparklypuff of the Department of Awesome (kewl huh&gt;??!) who is the best agent ever!&#39;. The DIO was a response to that - and never ended up being used for that purpose, since the trend stopped before I got them running.<br><br>Since then they&#39;ve kind of been a looming shadow. At the end of the day, they kill PPCers - and if the mood of the Board swings against someone&#39;s fic (the way people have been talking about Tawaki, say) there&#39;s a very real chance someone could decide to take the DIO out and kill that agent. That&#39;s what they were originally for - but I&#39;m glad it never happened.<br><br>Add to that the fact that they blatantly don&#39;t do their job (they have missed every single Badficfest to date), and the fact that the Elm is both Speshul (it lives outside) and just creepy... I don&#39;t like them as a department. Every time they go on a mission they do bad things to the PPC (and don&#39;t tell me that if I walked in here today and said &#39;I&#39;d like to start a department for killing Agents!&#39; I&#39;d have a chance in Mandos of being allowed).<br><br>The best part of the DIO is and always has been Justin - and if you&#39;re reading, Data, don&#39;t worry about him. He&#39;s not going to die in Dwarf Fortress: as soon as I get round to doing it, he&#39;s getting a picture-story reprieve. I picture him moving in with Undis Closed &#39;somewhere in the mountains of New Caledonia&#39;. His name even fits! [/Ramble]<br><br>So yeah: it depends what you were planning. Flashbacks with Justin, possibly Peter, and the Elm: yes. Present-day fics with any of them - no, since they&#39;d never allow themselves to contact him anyway. Present-day fics with Nita, I&#39;d probably say okay - I don&#39;t plan on doing anything else with her.<br><br>(And if you do do it, Justin on his return may come by for a chat...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not 100% sure what you&#39;re referring to when you say you&#39;re not sure they &#39;even do that&#39;, but I think you mean neuralyzing former members (if I&#39;m wrong, this next bit probably won&#39;t make any sense). That actually came from a line of Peter&#39;s dialogue in New Recruit, where, after Nita acknowledges having seen MiB, he says &#39;Good. Then you&#39;ll understand the concept of a job you are not allowed to leave without being dead or having your memory wiped. This is one of those jobs.&#39;<br><br>I&#39;d thought about using the whole DIO/secret keeping thing as a backdrop for some character interactions, with a current DIO agent keeping tabs on his former partner (and maybe getting too close). I would have probably tried to do some missions as well, if allowed, as I wouldn&#39;t want to have recurring agent characters just appearing in interludes. I&#39;d started giving some thought to how I could integrate my characters with the set-up and characters already presented, but considering the events of Royal Swan, that&#39;s pretty much just academic now. <br><br>If you are interested at all in seeing what thoughts your first couple of DIO pieces sparked in my brain, I could probably e-mail some notes or something.<br><br>When I started thinking about all this, a few weeks ago now, it looked like the DIO had only been used a couple of times, and had possibly fallen into neglect (having no idea what date any of the pieces were written). If I&#39;d known that anything like this was in the making, I doubt I&#39;d have bothered thinking about it. <br><br>I&#39;ll probably just remove any reference to the DIO in my plans. After all, the Message looks like it could provide plenty of fun and games.  <br></p>

            <p>I just like the idea of it being there, even if I don&#39;t get to use it. That said, the whole &#39;hunting down internal Sues&#39; could just as well be the DIA&#39;s responsibility, just with less MiB feeling. &#39;Policing the agents&#39; applies to agents turned Sues and agents who are actually Sues as well.<br><br>About the cherry-picking: That was more of a general statement.

            <p>I think the DIA already do it - they just don&#39;t call them Sues. And the rest of the time, the PPC just lets it slide - witness the Badficfests, where only two Sues (that I know of) have ever been killed.<br><br>And no, I can&#39;t provide a reference, simply because I&#39;ve not got a page of What Can&#39;t Be Used.

            <p>I...

            <p>For the record, I wasn&#39;t saying that he wasn&#39;t allowed to do anything. I was simply saying that I was no longer comfortable being involved with this storyline, which I admitted was probably a moot point, and saying why. And asking to use the Message so that I could explain (in-story, at least) why no references to this would appear in my work. What I was avoiding saying outright is that this is a lot darker than I&#39;d expect from the PPC. Counting both this and the previous story in the trilogy, we have: An agent being drugged against her will or knowledge, an agent going insane and killing several flowers, an innocent(seemingly, at least) agent being sent to certain death, and an innocent (again, seemingly) tree being banished to a place where he will likely never see a single being he ever knew.<br><br>Admittedly, I have not read much else of hS&#39; work, beyond the DoGA stuff, so this kind of tone may be par for the course for his more serious works.

            <p>I can&#39;t personally say if I remember if hS has ever said specifically that no one else is allowed to use that department, but I am pretty sure that responding in this manner was definitely crossing a line in terms of trying to be polite and respectful of others in the PPC.<br><br>Your response came across as being condescending, disrespectful, and overall dismissive of Data&#39;s opinion.

            <p>That doesn&#39;t make it okay to go &quot;LOL.&quot; at someone&#39;s reasonably diplomatic sincere question any less eyebrow-raising. You&#39;ve kind of been talking lately about how you don&#39;t really care about the PPC, or PPC canon, anymore, and you&#39;ve outgrown all this, and I get that. I really do. I write the Cafeteria stories for fun, and I don&#39;t read many spin-offs lately, and I&#39;m only recently starting to realize that I just don&#39;t know &#39;modern&#39; PPC canon all that well, these days. I understand that this isn&#39;t a really important thing to you anymore, and as has always been the case, I don&#39;t think that should impact the way anyone regards you at all; you don&#39;t have to write, breathe, and live PPC to be a Boarder.<br><br>But... your tone, juxtaposed with your saying things like &quot;I cared when I was thirteen, but I&#39;m not thirteen anymore,&quot; kind of makes it feel like you consider the rest of us immature, or somehow beneath your respect. And responses like this do nothing to make me feel better about that. Lately, I seem to be getting a lot of vaguely-directed irritation [from a lot of people] with anything new, and vaguely-spoken &quot;Things were better back when...&quot; ideas. And it&#39;s really kind of bad. It creates a hostile environment, for everyone involved.<br><br>Having been here longer than someone is not an excuse to treat their opinions, or them, with no respect. If a newbie posted something like this, no matter <i>how</i> true their reasoning was, everyone and their dog would be ripping them to shreds for it. This response, whether you are right or wrong in your reasoning*, really is pretty bad behavior, and I&#39;m not okay with you justifying it as amusement. Please be more respectful with how you treat others here.<br><br>--VM<br><br>*and I do actually agree that, given the Department is Huinesoron&#39;s, he should be able to write it out, and that as he pleases. We had this conversation in the IRC last night. Buuut as pointed out, Data also has the right to go &quot;Wow, this is dark, I don&#39;t want my agents in on it.&quot; So it&#39;s... complicated, I guess.</p>

            <p>While you&#39;re right about the things I&#39;ve said in recent posts, I didn&#39;t charge into any conversation going, &quot;Oh, yeah, I used to think this was all cool too . . . <i>when I was a kid</i>.&quot;  I agree, that would have been totally rude.  That only came up because I was directly asked why I&#39;d bothered to join.  And, well, that story goes back to when I was thirteen, and includes the fact that my life was completely different then.  (An epic tale indeed)<br><br>The points I actually led in with were equally true even when I was deeply active in the PPC.  I made the point years and years and years ago that nobody else&#39;s PPC writings had to seap into mine . . .  and the PPC has always been just an internet fandom.  I&#39;ve always thought it was important to keep that in perspective (and occasionally struggled to do so).<br><br>That doesn&#39;t make it an invalid hobby.  If it brings joy to your life, it&#39;s a fantastic hobby, whether you&#39;re young or old or decline to state.  It&#39;s no more immature than knitting or skydiving or, um, what do people do?  Stormchasing?  Baking?  Amature bronzework?  Maybe I know weird people.<br><br>Saying &quot;LOL.&quot; was immature, though.  I&#39;ll apologise for that.  Sorry, Data.  Cheers for your post, VM.</p>

Why another bad fanfic community, you ask? Aren&#39;t there places for that already, you ask?<br><br>Well, we asked ourselves the same question, and to us the answer was yes. We&#39;re here because we felt the need for a badfic community where the emphasis is on how it was written rather than what was written. We&#39;re driven by a desire to show people how not to write, as opposed to some other communities where the focus seems to be far more on telling people what not to write. We have no time for anyone who wants to work at the Ministry of Truth, and even less for those who want jobs at the Ministry of Love.&quot;<br><br>We&#39;re open to rants, discussion, and MSTings, of fanfic and published work. Members-only for the moment, but we&#39;re pretty open.</p>

            <p>Hello, everybody.  I was checking up on Goblins today when I came across an interesting <a href="http://www.goblinscomic.com/fourteen-ways-to-spot-a-bad-critic/">blog post</a> that I think is relevant to our interests around here.<br><br>While you read this list, I would recommend reflecting on the points.

            <p>Hello, everyone.  On a warm sunny day like today, I remembered reading a bit of the original series and thought of you kind souls.  I decided that I would check in and see what this whole outfit was about.  So, here it goes:<br><br>Hi, my name is The Rabbit from Hourai and I&#39;m an alcoholic!<br><br>Oh darn, wrong line.<br><br>Anyway, as far as fandoms go, I tend to drift in and out of them as my mood changes so I can&#39;t really say anything specific.  If it is science fiction, anime, military-related, or a combination of the above, then I will most likely be a fan of it or familiar with it.  Unless it is NCIS or JAG.  Those are rather low on my priorities list at the moment.</p>

            <p>Ender&#39;s Game is a fascinating look into the world of the military, despite being in the future.  I&#39;ve come across a few former officers who have confirmed that it&#39;s more or less an accurate depiction of the politics and backstabbing that goes on in the officer corps.  I&#39;ve always loved works of that scale, but when it starts getting into the million and billion-year timeframes, it starts to weird me out a little.  That&#39;s why, as much as I love God Emperor of Dune, I&#39;m not sure I can go further than that.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve heard of all those, but haven&#39;t really picked them up yet and have no plans to, because I&#39;ve made a detour into nonfiction and started reading Generation Kill and various other memoirs, from Grenada to Afghanistan.  Also, the scale of Ender just weirds me out.  It&#39;s the same reason I haven&#39;t read the Forever War or any of the Dune books past God Emperor yet.

            <p>I&#39;ve heard of them through Baen, as well as being pointed towards a now-infamous blog post about Ghost.  Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, I&#39;ve only just been able to start buying books again and Belisarius is on my to-do list along with some of Ringo&#39;s stuff.<br><br>A writer I&#39;ve been following through the internet, Jack Murphy, offered up his book Reflexive Fire for free on Amazon awhile back so I took to reading that.  Although not strictly sci-fi, it was good fun and basically an extended love letter to special operations guys and DARPA madness.</p>

            <p>But don&#39;t read the epilogue. Seriously. Don&#39;t. And since you said money is a bit tight, have you tried the <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/"> Baen Free Library</a>? It&#39;s basically an f-you to the literary pirates, and... Ah heck. It&#39;s pretty cool. It&#39;s what I do if I&#39;m on long trips and I&#39;ve got a break.<br><br>What&#39;s Reflexive Fire about? (It seems that pretty much every military sci fi is a love letter to <i>someone</i>. <u>Watch on the Rhine</u> of the Posleen War series was a love letter to the Waffen SS of Nazi Germany... The writing is good, and at least the Nazi callbacks were (relatively) good people. Given that it&#39;s the Waffen SS, though...)</p>

            <p>Oh, yes.  That&#39;s where I got the Honor Harrington books from, and a pretty classy move if I do say so myself.<br><br>Reflexive Fire is about an ex-Special Activities guy named Deckard who gets a contract to train and lead a mercenary company from the weirdos in Bohemian Grove, then stumbles onto a bigger conspiracy.  You can&#39;t turn around without bumping into a former spec ops soldier in Deckard&#39;s outfit, amusingly enough.</p>

            <p>Could you actually not do that, please? PPC Wiki isn&#39;t really meant to be Fandoms-R-Us, and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve never heard of any missions in that continuum, or agents from there, or some massive surge in popularity, or anything else that would warrant us having a page for it at this time. If that ever changes, then sure, create away, but for now a link to Wikipedia or another wiki is more appropriate if you feel you need to link to something.<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re unfamiliar with wiki-editing, I recommend doing some homework. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Editing">This should be a good place to start</a>.

            <p>I do the kind of writing that never gets done because of my lack of motivation.  Silliness aside, I write mostly short stories and one-shots, though I haven&#39;t been particularly prolific.  My main weakness is extended stories because I tend to be good at thinking of how I want them to begin and how I want it to end, but filling in the middle part is tricky.<br><br>My main interests are in side stories in the same setting or marginally related to the main plot of the original but which do not generally intersect it.  I&#39;m fascinated by the implications of settings and like to explore them for better or worse, and once I get an idea for an OC in my head, I can&#39;t really rest easy until I&#39;ve &quot;exorcised&quot; it somehow.</p>

            <p>Personally I prefer pie, but if out of pie, then any sweet stuff is great.  Cake is fine too.  Why yes, I was a fan of Touhou a couple of years ago but I got out due to the influx of secondaries.  I have no problem with people being fans in their own way but since they rubbed me the wrong way, so to speak, we parted ways amicably.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see.  I have great memories of my time in the Warhammer 40,000 fandom and if I move back to a country where I could find more opponents, I&#39;d probably be back onto it in a flash.  At various times I&#39;ve been a fan of the various &quot;non-traditional&quot; magical girl shows like Nanoha and Madoka, Black Lagoon, Star Wars, Honor Harrington, the Type-Moon stuff, and Gundam, to name a few.<br><br>At the moment I&#39;m warming up to Jormungand, Cat Shit One, and Armored Trooper VOTOMS.  Some argue that I might want to consider a more balanced lifestyle but being a jack-of-all-trades is a little overrated in my opinion.</p>

            <p>Pie is the greatest of treats and I will have to restock on it with all due haste.<br><br>I do see what you mean there. I really enjoy the games and the canon, but I tend to stay far away from Touhou&#39;s fandom. Memes and silly character interpretations can be fun occasionally, but I feel that it shouldn&#39;t characterize the canon itself. Or be over-used to the point of banality.</p>

            <p>As a certified Dane I should be able to help, but like Artell I can&#39;t come up with any English words with the same sound. In fact, there&#39;s a myth saying that during World War 2 the Danes would find German spies by making them say the phrase &#39;rшdgrшd med flшde&#39; which only native Danes could ever get right. The story is not true, but it serves to illustrate just how alien the pronunciation is to non-Scandinavians.<br><br>But I digress.

            <p>To Whom It May Concern,<br><br>There&#39;s something that&#39;s been bothering me quite a lot lately, and it&#39;s one reason I&#39;m glad for all the attention being given our fine Constitution at the moment. In general, it&#39;s a document we should all try to keep in mind when interacting in this community, but sometimes I feel like it gets forgotten, so I&#39;d kind of like to bring a few things to general attention for... er, discussion or thought or whichever.<br><br><b><i>11.</i></b> If you have a problem with a fellow PPC Boarder, please try to work it out in private emails. Don’t turn the Board into a free-for-all Flamefest. <br><br>I&#39;m sure most of us have at some point or other gone &quot;ARGH, [Person] is driving me crazy!&quot; about someone in our lives, both on and offline. But I&#39;m noticing this tendency, on the IRC especially, that it seems to be considered acceptable to complain openly about personal issues with other PPCers. I&#39;m not singling anyone out here - I know for a fact I&#39;ve caught myself doing this as well. But I am saying this:<br><br>It is <b>never</b> okay to trash-talk a fellow PPCer. Ever. On the &#39;Board, on the IRC, in the Lounge... it just isn&#39;t. Don&#39;t do it. Please. Even if they are actually present, rather than go &quot;Hey! You! I have A PROBLEM WITH YOU,&quot; pm them. Nicely. It really, really is Not On to go after someone in front of the entire chatroom, no matter <i>what</i> your authority level is. Permission Givers, Designated Arbitrators, and Mods - all of these titles exist for very, very specific purposes, and none of those purposes involve personally calling someone out for past behavior. (Present behavior, yes, but that is limited to &quot;Stop doing that thing which you are doing Right Now At This Moment,&quot; and does not include &quot;This thing you&#39;re doing that&#39;s bothering me, don&#39;t do it anymore.&quot; It very especially does not include &quot;This Person is doing a thing that bothers me, isn&#39;t it annoying, shouldn&#39;t they stop?&quot;)<br><br>This next item is rather more ambiguous in the Constitution, but we&#39;re all thinking adults here, and I have faith in everyone&#39;s ability to decode this language:<br><br><b><i>1.</i></b> Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. So be nice! Treat everyone else on the board with respect!<br><br>Respect means many things, but one of those things is that if someone is going &quot;Please stop talking about [really disturbing thing], it is making me uncomfortable/triggering me/upsetting me,&quot; we really, <i>really</i> need to have enough respect for their boundaries to stop. And then to not continue talking about it. Or if you really must talk about it, to take the conversation into a room where they are not... and this one&#39;s important: Do <i>not</i> push them about it. Don&#39;t say things like &quot;But why? It&#39;s not a big deal!&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s a weird thing to be triggered over,&quot; or PM them to continue talking about it. Just let it go - respect people&#39;s boundaries over sensitive subjects. This isn&#39;t censorship, this is asking you to do something like /join #SensitiveSubjectChat and take the conversation there.<br><br>Those are the two important things, but there&#39;s one more I think could use another airing-out:<br><br><i><b>14.</b> If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. They probably didn’t mean to offend anyone. (If they DID mean to insult people, go ahead and jump down their throats if you like.) </i><br><br>Communication. It&#39;s a really, really nice thing, and we as a species really seem to be doing well when we use it. So use it. Don&#39;t assume the other person is being a jerk, don&#39;t jump down their throat, don&#39;t immediately bite back as hard as you can. If you&#39;re that upset, and cannot fathom whatever the person said to <i>not</i> be an insult? There are replies for that, like &quot;That seemed really insulting/offensive. What exactly did you mean by that?&quot; or the like. If you&#39;re really, <i>really</i> upset, and can&#39;t even muster the calm to do that, it&#39;s usually a good idea to step away from the conversation and return when you&#39;re no longer utterly furious... and <i>then</i> ask them, via PM if the conversation has waned or you feel this might be an affront to Rule Eleven, what they meant by saying that, whatever &#39;that&#39; happened to be.<br><br>Again, I really don&#39;t mean to pick out anyone, and I&#39;d like to make that very clear. I would not be taking the time to write something like this up if one person was setting off these issues, even if it was the same person for all three, or one person for each, or whatever. I&#39;d be talking to them directly, as per Rule Eleven. And, like I said, I&#39;ve done all of these. Jumped down people&#39;s throats, stepped over boundaries, and complained about other people. I&#39;ve just noticed these behaviors popping up to an uncomfortable extent, and figured we could maybe all use a reminder. So... er, thank you and carry on and all that jazz.</p>

            <p>Hello, PPC boarders! Allow me to introduce myself. I am a sixteen-year-old artist, writer and amateur actress from upstate New York. I&#39;ve been frequenting PPC Wiki for a while and enjoying its stories immensely, and I&#39;ve finally gotten up the courage to post a little! <br><br>In other words: While I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m going about this entirely in the wrong fashion, I&#39;m trying it anyway. :]<br><br>I am most heavily involved in various Dr. Seuss continuities! Specifically, Horton Hears a Who! and The Lorax. I know these aren&#39;t incredibly common fandoms and I respect that many of you probably don&#39;t really know much about them... however, I&#39;d appreciate a review on a few of my characters and two stories, one of which is so far afield an AU that it may even constitute a mostly original story, and one that... um, isn&#39;t? <br><br>I like to write about my perception of events off-screen and of things to come post-storyline. In other words: I do not like to mess with canon. I try to take canon characters in a direction that makes sense to me; this does not, however, mean I expect everyone to agree with me, and I love to hear their ideas! <br>I acknowledge that some of my older characters were cliched and still hold some of their slightly Sueish elements. I&#39;d appreciate fix suggestions on that. <br><br>I&#39;m also a shipping maniac who&#39;s equally accepting, though slightly more inclined toward het, to things of all orientations. Which brings me to my next point: I also really, really like South Park, and I&#39;m kind of in the process of writing Style smuttiness as a request for my best friend... It&#39;s my first try at this, so if anyone wants to wade through terrible slash and give me some tips that won&#39;t make my head burst in embarrassment, that would be cool too. =3 <br><br>I&#39;ll acknowledge right now that I can commit fangirlism as much as anyone else. I&#39;m also a first-person specialist and, of course, 16- but I try not to let it show too much. :D <br><br>... I know I had other things to say, but I&#39;m writing this in the middle of science class and so my thoughts are a little fuzzy. Apologies! If you&#39;re interested, give me a call at ShiningBarboach.deviantart.com, or drop your email address and I will message you privately. <br> </p>

            <p>Welcome! I&#39;ve actually heard of the Lorax fandom (I noticed most people call it the Once-ler fandom, though that may be just tumblr) because of some overlap with the Professor Layton fandom. Not part of it myself, however.<br><br>Ooh, another shipping maniac! Yeah, I pretty much have at least one ship per fandom, if not multiple.

            <p>Haha! Of course you&#39;d have heard that. I&#39;m actually a little proud of myself on that front- I heard of The Lorax and chose Oncey as my favorite character way the heck and gone on November 22nd, 2011. So I&#39;m really one of the original fans. Neato, you&#39;ve got a Tumblr? I&#39;ve played through a Professor Layton game, I loved it to pieces despite how hard it was! :D <br><br>The Onceluts are very diverse, they overlap with most everything. I suppose that that particular area of crossing over has to do with top hats. Same with Superjail. SHRUG <br><br>OH HECK YEAUS. I always get my big fancy OTP (Style, Feferidan, Style, Oncest, Style... um, I don&#39;t think I mentioned Style yet) for every fandom but then I just end up whoring around. I just love the warm fuzzies, here in my pathetic l&#39;il life. <br>Umm, I used to be hugely involved in the Percy Jackson continuity! Other than that... I know a fair deal about Naruto and Fullmetal Alchemist, though I&#39;m not really a fan anymore. I also used to be a major Sonitard, but let&#39;s not talk about that. I&#39;m big on Homestuck, and I&#39;ve been reading Harry Potter since I was a mite. I know My Little Pony pretty well, though since I discovered South Park I&#39;ve been weaning myself off because it bugs my best friend to no end. I also absolutely freakin&#39; love Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off, but there&#39;s not really a fandom outside of me for that, haha. But mostly at the moment it&#39;s all Horton! and Lorax and South Park. :] Though you should really try me! I&#39;ve seen a bunch of stuff. <br><br>Thanks for welcoming me! <br> </p>

I, too, adore hats, and am commonly admonished in class for wearing one. Currently my favorite is my Kyle Broflovski green bomber hat, a present from my best friend on the 10th, which was my birthday. But I also love my fedora and my buffalo hat, and I own, like, 20!

            <p>Welcome to the board.  I must confess I didn&#39;t even know there was a fanfiction community for Dr. Seuss continuities but I shouldn&#39;t really be surprised.  You learn something new every day.  South Park is cool and, strangely enough, less preachy than some other shows out there in spite of having Stan say &quot;y&#39;know I learned something...&quot; at the end of every episode.<br><br>Hey, don&#39;t worry about having Sue-ish elements in your characters and trying to stomp them *all* out.  We were all like that at one point in time or another.  We could, of course, play it safe and not make mistakes but that would be like never learning to ride a bicycle because you were afraid to get hurt.  Besides, from my point of view, if a character doesn&#39;t stand out in some way why should we, as the audience, pay attention to them?</p>

            <p>Thanks! ;D <br><br>Haha, well, maybe I should clarify that. There IS a fanfiction community... However. It&#39;s quite small, ESPECIALLY in the case of Horton, and the fans for HHaW... Well, I love a good read as much as anyone, but let&#39;s just say when I wanna read good Who stories, I&#39;ve usually gotta go write &#39;em first. :/ It bites! <br><br>That&#39;s one of the big things I LOVE about SP! Maybe it&#39;s the fact that I only own seasons 11 and 15 and, due to the fact that I actually don&#39;t have cable TV and only have limited bandwidth on my home Internet, I&#39;ve only seen a handful of other episodes at my Gramma&#39;s, but somehow I&#39;ve only managed to see like 2 episodes where the moral is explicitly stated, and one of those was by Kyle. Pff. But yeah- basically, the sense of humor is very similar to the one in my household, being very curse-laden and playing into a bunch of stereotypes, but at the end of the day, we/they are very open minded and end up shattering more preconceptions than we/they feed, and there&#39;s always a lesson to be learned~ And dat cast! I really love huge, colorful, diverse casts where everyone somehow manages to be lovable! I love this show. I&#39;d write more of it but I&#39;m really nervous about writing kids since I still feel like one and can&#39;t seem to draw maturity lines, and I feel like my older versions are downright shoddy and cliched. <br><br>... But I digress. The fan&#39;s dilemma. Sorry about that. XD <br><br>One of my main characters started as what was pretty much a self insert. Thanks to a healthy dose of low self esteem she survived with flaws intact, buuuuut I kinda ship her with my favorite character from HHaW (... Or anything else, for that matter) and so she ended up sorta Sueish. I&#39;ve succeeded in diverging our paths, making her more of a serious character than an experiment and leaving her with more of my younger personality from the period of her creation if I give her similarities to me at all, but she can still be a bit of a Sue. Ah well, we write what we know, I guess- and I&#39;m nothing if not self-critical, hehe! :P And one of my primary original characters lived through a school shooting because they fascinate me and I&#39;ve researched them extensively, and while most of his resulting psychological quirks are realistic I still think he ends up being a big old emo cliched mess on occasion. I sure hope that counts as interesting to an outsider! XD <br><br>Teal deer, thanks for the warm welcome- it&#39;s very nice to meet you, Rabbit! If I can call you that. And then some rambling, but who cares!</p>

            <p>Free fanart? Yes, please! You can take your pick of my PPC characters, I&#39;m not choosy. If you need suggestions or details, though, I&#39;m happy to give them. Also, references for some can be found <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/gallery/3718708">in my dA account</a>, and there are descriptions on their wiki pages.<br><br>Also, concrit! As someone who also draws stuff (or used to, or needs to start again, or something), I figure feedback is always good:<br><br>It&#39;s unfortunate that the scan isn&#39;t very good, but it&#39;s apparent that you&#39;ve got really clean lines and a grasp of three-dimensionality, which is awesome.<br><br>I&#39;m not at all sure how that shirt works, though. It seems to be somehow molded to her chest, which it can&#39;t do to that extent if it&#39;s made of fabric, and that&#39;s a really awkward location for pockets (if they are pockets?)—generally speaking, the top of breast pockets on shirts goes higher up than your actual female breast-level.<br><br>Speaking of which, her chest is impossibly large for her frame and not quite hooked up properly. Breasts don&#39;t really extend above the armpit (they stretch downward as they get larger, never upward), and the outside lines in particular make them look like they&#39;re attached to her collarbones. In any case, the size of them would throw off her balance and make it impossible for her to walk properly, let alone anything more complicated. Big is one thing, but I&#39;m thinking those are about the size of a gallon of milk each, and that&#39;s way, way off the chart. I speculate that this is possibly putting people off from getting involved in this thread. (I&#39;m not too concerned about my characters, since most of my main ones are dudes and one is a blue centaur alien.)<br><br>The arms are also kinda short for your standard humanoid, though I&#39;m willing to overlook that since they&#39;re clearly not human arms, what with the claws and all. Rule of thumb for humans, though, is that the fingertips should extend to about the middle of the thigh when outstretched.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I thought in crossovers the mini depended on whatever name was misspelled. For example, if it was a Harry Potter and LotR fic and it was Harry&#39;s name misspelled it would be a mini-Acromantula but if it was Frodo&#39;s name misspelled it would be a mini-Balrog.</p>

            <p>Hello there! Have a PPG. It&#39;s shiny, just like you, and it shoots plasma!<br><br>By the way, there&#39;s a few things you have to know before joining the PPC. I apologize, but we do get a massive amount of newbie questions that are answered there, and we&#39;d like to make sure people read this stuff.<br><br>First, have you checked out the PPC Wiki yet? It&#39;s avaliable here: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki</a></a>. On there are a few things you really, really should read all the way through: The Guide to the PPC, the Mission Writing Guide, and the FAQ: For Newbies pages are really important!<br><br>Also, have you read the Original Series yet? They&#39;re the fics by Jay and Acacia that started all of this, and they are only one of two things here that you absolutely have to do. Y&#39;see, ultimately the PPC is a shared-universe fanfic based off of the Original Series, and as a result you absolutely have to read them. They&#39;re our canon; you can&#39;t write fanfic without knowing the canon. They&#39;re available here: <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/"><a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/</a></a> . <br></p>

            <p>I currently have a new Suicide and Diocletian mission in the works, but in the meantime, there&#39;s something else that I&#39;d like to plug here. Namely, the story of Suicide&#39;s resurrection.<br><br>There&#39;s always been more to Su and his weirdness. I tried telling this story once before, but it went awry, and I&#39;ve officially scrubbed that horrible piece out of his canon. This  new vignette is pretty straightforward: &quot;welcome to the PPC, Suicide. Please stop strangling Doc Fitz.&quot;<br><br>After juggling several viewpoints and drafts, I decided to tell this from Su&#39;s own perspective. Which means a) it&#39;s a series of vignettes instead of a straightforward three-act plot, and b) <b>language warning.</b> Warning also for descriptions of what it&#39;s like to be disemboweled, but I think we all knew that was coming. Doesn&#39;t excuse Su&#39;s potty mouth, though.<br><br>Feedback and concrit much appreciated. <a href="http://bronzeclockwork.livejournal.com/1728.html"><a href="http://bronzeclockwork.livejournal.com/1728.html">http://bronzeclockwork.livejournal.com/1728.html</a></a><br></p>

            <p>This was quite fun!  I love Suicide&#39;s Very Different viewpoint of everything he encounters in Medical, and of being killed then not killed.  I love how the Igors are actually easier to understand when their listener only hears the phonetic sounds of their voice (easier to me at least).<br><br>I kind of wish I could have seen his reaction to learning that the entire structure of nations he knew vanished centuries ago.  Not to mention coming to understand the PPC&#39;s mission, and meeting Diocletian . . . but perhaps another day?<br><br>One grammar mistake: In the third paragraph, &quot;Each movement send shocks of pain crawling up his arms.&quot;  I think that should be &quot;Each movement sent . . .&quot;</p>

            <p>Do I detect a hint of Dream Theatre?  *sniff sniff*  I believe I do.  Am I wrong?<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve never heard of the character before but am I to assume that he comes from some sort of historical fantasy or alternate history version of Ancient Greece?  Around the time of the Battle of Thermopylae, if I&#39;m not mistaken.  Being able to convey that level of information to those who aren&#39;t familiar with the work is, in my opinion, what separates the great introductions from the merely good, so congratulations on that.  If it were me writing, I might have found a way to work in some more allusions to the setting so I could establish what kind of universe Suicide comes from but that is a matter of personal preference.<br><br>I am concerned with the language.  I have no issue with swearing, it seems in character for Su, but the swears seem too modern and out of place for a soldier from ancient times.  I do not know for sure as I am not a historian, but this is what I feel.  Or maybe it was the language implant.<br><br>Aside from that I have no other comments.  Well done, overall.</p>

            <p>I have no idea what Dream Theatre is, so I&#39;m afraid you may be wrong there.<br><br>And yes, he comes from a historical novel called <i>Gates of Fire</i>, set around Thermopylae. He&#39;s actually a noncanon copy of a character in the novel who was killed; the mad scientists of the PPC&#39;s medical research department figured that a loose canon, who was already a practiced killer and insane, could be useful to them.<br><br>The swearing was difficult to decide on, I admit. In the end, though, I decided to use modern English; it would seem weird to have him speaking English in everything except swearwords. It&#39;s the same reason I called it &quot;Greece&quot; instead of &quot;Hellas.&quot; And the ancients swore by sex, violence and excrement just like we do. XD<br><br>Thanks very much for the feedback! I&#39;m glad the information was able to come across to a new reader. :)</p>

            <p>One of their albums is called Scenes from a Memory and I pursued that line of enquiry on the off chance that the title was a reference to that.  Well, I have been known to make mistakes from time to time.  Dream Theater likes to go on 10 or 15 minute experimental prog odysseys.  Other than that the title of the album, it has nothing to do with anything.</p>

            <p>First off, I liked this piece.  <br><br>Nita is really having a hard time adjusting to life outside the DIO, which is to be expected.  I really feel for her.  Everything and everyone she knew is gone, and Upstairs didn&#39;t even have the decency to wipe her memory.  Can&#39;t blame her for seeking out some solitude.<br><br>The Spirit of the PPC sure does like the titles, huh?<br><br>I liked the treatment of the doors in the hallway.  It is so rarely mentioned anymore that the halls and doors like to mess with people.  There is a lot of fun to be had with that, and it is good to see.<br><br>It occurs to me that the Spirit of Imagination, in this piece, is somewhat lacking in imagination.  She does the same thing over and over again?  That spirit needs to get out more (taken care of in the end, of course).<br><br>Nita is very genre savvy.  It is good to see someone thinking about these things before setting off on a quest.  I enjoyed her explanation of how such a quest would go, and the reactions of the Spirit when confronted with it.<br><br>Loved the inclusion of the third spirit.  I approve.<br><br>Overall, well done.  It had a serious tone, but there were enough moments of humor to lighten it up.<br><br>-Phobos</p>
