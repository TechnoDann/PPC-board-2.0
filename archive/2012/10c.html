            <p>THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS BOTH SPOILERS FOR THE MISSION AND SUBJECTIVE COMMENTS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.<br><br>I had a few concerns with how your characters acted, both with each other and by themselves. First off was this one line in particular:<br><br><i> &quot;Gall . . . when I was aware of anything, I was afraid. I believed you would leave me to rot and murder Vanya without charges. Why didn&#39;t you?&quot;</i><br><br>There&#39;s nothing wrong with the line by itself. The problem for me was that I never really believed that Gall would &#39;leave him to rot.&#39; Everything she had done up to that point never really reached a level of antagonism where I might accept that she&#39;d leave him in the lurch. Gall seemed like a typical snarky headstrong partner. I would&#39;ve bought her prematurely finish the mission without him, but not abandoning Derik entirely. The above line could be exaggeration on Derik&#39;s part, of course, but I did not see anything that would indicate it as such.<br><br>The other major problem I had with this piece was with Derik himself. It was never really explained why (or I just didn&#39;t see where) he was having such a problem on this particular day. The point where he starts crying is never really touched upon after that moment despite Gall&#39;s little comment at the end of section suggesting it might be. I found myself not really caring about him, which in turn hurt my enjoyment of the back and forth agent banter (which, I should note, was otherwise very good.)<br><br>Sorta related (in that Derik is involved) was the bit where he was knocked out. The whole section in his head doesn&#39;t really add anything to the overall plot. The lines near the end of that about Derik&#39;s duty felt a little too cheesy to me to be taken seriously.<br><br>There were some excellent bits of dialogue, particularly with Derik and Gall are doing their disapproving father/rebellious daughter thing. I really enjoyed that dynamic when the previously mentioned issues weren&#39;t getting in the way of it.<br><br>The mission as a whole just felt average to me. The fic being sporked did not really hook me in any particular way, which normally isn&#39;t too much of a problem if the agent interactions are solid or the jokes are golden. Had your agents been more consistent in their characterizations, I probably would have enjoyed this much more.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>Gall makes for a very fun and different PPC agent!  We see often enough an agent who tries to reign themselves in to avoid assassinating the Sue too early, but I think Gall is the first one I&#39;ve seen who just outright doesn&#39;t care about the rules.  She&#39;s going to be difficult to keep under control, for both you and Derik, I think.  I&#39;m glad you included a scene with an example of <i>why</i> bringing &quot;pets&quot; on missions is frowned upon.  Hopefully Gall takes that into account at least <i>sometimes</i>.<br><br>Ah, the old String-Them-Between-Things-That-They-Geologically-Compressed-So-They-Get-Torn-Apart-By-The-Canon-Rearranging assassination . . . is getting a little too old for me, honestly.  I was hoping you would just flat-out feed Vanya to the canon werewolves, so I&#39;m glad you at least gave them a small appearance to dispose of her glittery bits.<br><br>Also, I got angrier and angrier at the similarity between &quot;Vanya&quot; and &quot;Vania&quot; as the mission continued.  I know that isn&#39;t a legitimate criticism against the Suethor in any way, but the spellings and pronunciations are just WAY too close.  Makes me uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>Gall is a risk, but the good news is that I often had to check myself when she was being too <i>agreeable</i> rather than the other way around. She is fun to write, though. *g* And yeah, Derik is going to have to crack down on her about Snerri. He did say it was her partner&#39;s responsibility...<br><br>Huh, I wonder where else geological expansion has come up, besides the &quot;legolas&quot; mission. I wasn&#39;t aware it was popular at the moment. I DO know feeding a Sue to the werewolves has also been done at least once before, though. Guess I&#39;ll have to stretch my brain more next time.<br><br>It is annoying when a Sue uses a name that means something to you. I had my eye on a <i>Harry Potter</i> fic where it was MY name, but it seems to have been deleted now. I am not sad.<br><br>Thanks for commenting!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I do get a feeling we&#39;re all suffering from mission-length inflation...<br><br>Anyhow. I didn&#39;t particularly like Gall to start with - no particular reason, she just bugged me - but she seemed to improve over time, so that&#39;s good. I did enjoy the puppet-theatre moments - although, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re already aware, doing it too often would wear mighty thin - and the fact that you kept neatly in the bounds of what each agent knew (the line about the dragon&#39;s name comes to mind; and speaking of which, how many Sues are <i>that</i> insecure that they name their CAFs &#39;Mine, y&#39;all!&#39;?)<br><br>Oh, and Selene says... well, actually she says &#39;YAAAARGH LEMME ATTEM CALLING THEMSELVES VAMPIRES KILLKILLKILL&#39;, but she&#39;s insane these days. If she <i>wasn&#39;t</i>, she&#39;d say she was amused to see her assassination method catching on.<br><br>(Of course, it was actually Dafydd&#39;s idea, but hey - she&#39;s an old-fashioned vamp-girl, <i>all</i> the ideas are hers in her head)<br><br>hS in&#39;t good at reviews</p>

            <p>(Also, Phobos says &quot;That&#39;s what she said.&quot;)<br><br>It&#39;s about 16,600 words. This one at least has the excuse of covering two fics, though, unlike some of my others. &gt;.&gt; I do TRY to keep the length down, I swear. I abandoned whole planned segments for this one—there was a &quot;calvary&quot; in Rohan, for instance, and there was the thing where she kept misspelling &quot;border,&quot; so we had the &quot;boarders of Lothlorien.&quot; I had volunteer Boarders and everything.<br><br>Gall has a sort of essential roughness and nastiness to her, so not liking her is acceptable. She did start life as a Stock Bully. Her job is to make the kinds of jokes and do things my other characters are too classy to attempt, like pulling pranks on the Sue. And also to kick Derik when he gets too angsty, which he did a lot of in this one because it was the anniversary of his dragon&#39;s death.<br><br>Speaking of him, he probably got the idea for executing Vanya from the report for &quot;legolas.&quot; It IS famous, after all, and he&#39;s the type to do his background reading. Either way, it&#39;s very poetic. After what she did to the Anduin, I couldn&#39;t let the opportunity pass. The first fic probably could&#39;ve been DOGA material.<br><br>Poor Selene.

            <p>I believe this is the first Puella Magi mission we&#39;ve had. It&#39;s also the first mission involving a trio of new agents.

            <p>This was a pretty complicated mission, but I think you handled it rather well.  It&#39;s not very common to see an all-OC mission, but the fact that you treated them with a mixture of assassination, recruitment and canon absorption kept things from getting repetitive.  Your treatment of Erika was especially fun, and made the threat of her getting ensnared by Violet all the more real and depressing.<br><br>I did have a little trouble keeping up with all the canon-specific terminology.  I think I developed a fair understanding of how Puella Magi come about and their relationship to witches and Soul Gems, but I&#39;m still a little unclear on what Grief Seeds and Incubators do.<br><br>Earlier in this mission, you had a habit of overusing pronouns, which made it difficult for me to &quot;see&quot; what was going on.  For example, near the beginning, you have the sentences:<br><b>A bright green light began to glow from her middle finger, before eight tentacle-shaped constructs emerged and wrapped around her stack, before carefully setting it on the ground. A moment later, the tentacles wrapped around her pile, setting it next to Cepha’s.</b><br>&quot;Her stack&quot; and &quot;her pile&quot; confused me the first time I read it, since the double use of &quot;her&quot; made me think the same pile of gifts was being moved twice.  Fortunately, this problem seemed to lessen as the mission continued.<br><br>Also, one little typo to point out.  In the charge list you missed putting a space between &quot;putting&quot; and &quot;chandeliers.&quot;</p>

            <p>Warning, this is spoiler for the series itself. (I suggest you to watch it, though - it&#39;s really good.)<br><br>Basically, Grief Seeds are what a Witch leaves behind when she dies, and they can absorb grief from a Puella Magi&#39;s Soul Gem.<br><br>The catch is, Grief Seeds actually are what remains of a Puella Magi&#39;s Soul Gem when it corrupts beyond repair (a process caused by magic use and despair felt) and becomes a Witch.<br><br>The Incubators are the one who allow a girl to become a Puella Magi, and they harvest the emotional energy coming from the girls&#39; despair to stave off entropy.<br>The problem is, a Puella Magi is <i>doomed</i>: she either dies while battling withes, or becomes a Witch herself.<br><br>They&#39;re not evil, they just have a completely different set of morals and lack any sort of emotion.

            <p>I know, right? The last time I did this was... about three and a half yonks ago, I think.<br><br>Anyway. I have a series of 15 PPC-related short stories which I think it might be sensible to have someone look over before I throw them at the Board. They really need the full works - ie, are they any good, are they internally consistent, are they SPG&#39;d, are there any technical problems with the site they&#39;re on, Any Other Business.<br><br>No special knowledge requirements, although a) it&#39;d help if you don&#39;t actively hate steampunk, b) a certain amount of Doctor Who knowledge would help for one of the pieces, and c) I&#39;d quite like to get this all sorted quickly.<br><br>So... anyone up for helping?<br><br>hS</p>

Also, it had a completely canon crossover with MGLN where Nanoha, Fate, Miyu (character original to this comic) and Illya team up, and Fate chops an apartment building in half.<br><br>[It does feature a lot of fanservice-y shots, so do be warned.)</p>

            <p>I mean, not of this particular instance, but yes. Which mini you get is entirely dependent on what fandom the fic is. For example, if you had a &quot;Modern girl in Middle-Earth&quot; story and she was talking about the Pirates of the Caribbean movies for whatever reason, and she misspelled &quot;Will Turner&quot;, it would still be a mini-Balrog, not a Misspelled Monkey.</p>

            <p>I mean, by that logic, any misspelled <i>Harry Potter</i> names in &quot;Ring Child&quot; would&#39;ve been mini-Balrogs, too, because the fic was set there and not in the Potterverse. I don&#39;t think that makes sense. The characters are still Potterverse characters even if they turn up in Middle-earth, so shouldn&#39;t the minis be Potterverse minis, as well?<br><br>Also, I think that would result in some seriously identity-confused minis. What OFU would a mini-Balrog named Arry Potter belong to, for instance? He&#39;s not a <i>Rings</i> character misspelling, so he wouldn&#39;t fit at OFUM, but if he&#39;s not a mini-Aragog, how does he work at HFA?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hey look, a really late person has arrived! It&#39;s sad, I&#39;m usually first to greet the newbies and pile important links into their inbox or whatever you may call it. All the same, welcome a-Board the good ship PPC, where the goodfic is the fish, the badfic is the sharks, and the PPCers are those crazy shark hunting people you see on the Discovery Channel (That&#39;s depending on whether or not you watch the Discovery Channel.

            <p>First of all, thanks for the cloak. It&#39;s perfect, as I get cold easily.<br>As for my fandoms, basically the same as my sister. We tend to get into them together, though I have some preferences(Star Trek:VOY over Star Trek:TNG). And am I involved in OFAS? Heavily. I am Miss Maria, the assistant course coordinator. I brainstormed ideas with her, drew the school crest, and recently I got bored and came up with an idea for later on.</p>

            <p>You need the following things in a Permission request (which you post here in the Board; I assume you know the Constitution and TOS already):<br>1. Brief summaries about your Agents: the summaries should be enough to see that the Agents aren&#39;t Sues/Stus, and should contain the Department you want them to be in, but otherwise what&#39;s in there is pretty much up to you.<br>2. A link to the badfic you intend to spork in your first mission.<br>3. A writing sample. Before you ask: yes, you can (and are encouraged to) use a Beta&#39;s services.

            <p>My sister and I found this fic before, in fact, I was its one follower for a while. We had it on our list of &quot;Fics to Spork When/If We Get Permission&quot;. Maybe once we&#39;ve done the OFAS co-write, and my sister and I get Permission and write our first mission. We planned this as our second. She&#39;s terrible. She goes after Harry, AND Icheb, AND Q Junior, she has an unnatural obsession with redvines and sslurpees, Naomi is pretty much a character replacement, and half of OFAS&#39;s Voyager minis and all of the Icheb and Borg ones come from this fic. She was typing with her eyes closed. In fact, I think I could spell better than that with my eyes closed.</p>

            <p>Some words I can understand the odd misspellings of (like assimilate or Icheb, because they are slightly tricky), but there are others for which there is no excuse. Seven of Nine (or even 7 of 9), spelt as 7 of 8 or 8 of 9? That&#39;s a totally different designation! And the amount of Suethors misspelling Borg - it&#39;s four letters, spelt as said, for crying out loud! I wonder if a &#39;bog cube&#39; is something like the portable swamps in <i>Harry Potter</i>? The &#39;nanna probes&#39; were just plain amusing, and never mind the &#39;turno lifet&#39;. No wonder you started an OFU; you have enough minis to staff one just from this single fic.<br><br>Would you like me to put it on the Claimed Badfic list under your name (and Apricot&#39;s), with a note saying &#39;pending permission&#39;? Regardless, I&#39;ll leave it available for you. When/if you do spork it, I eagerly await the result. :)<br><br>I&#39;ll make sure not to tell my agents this fic exists, because they will go crazy. Especially Agent Cyba. In fact, best not to let Sigma or Phi know, either.</p>

            <p>Sure, we&#39;ll claim it. Since we were thinking of asking for Permission around the New Year, and this will be our second mission, it&#39;ll be a while until it officially gets sporked. But the first one&#39;s fairly short, and I might start writing before I get Permission (just not posting it yet, of course).</p>

            <p>No one screws up &quot;7 of 9&quot; unless they&#39;re doing it on purpose. Also, the sheer variety of the misspellings. If someone legitimately doesn&#39;t know how to spell something, I think they tend to take a guess and stick to it. The kinds of typos people make tend to be similar, too—shifting your finger(s) one key right or left, or dropping/adding letters in unfamiliar configurations if muscle memory takes over and you switch to something you type more frequently, etc.—and this is all over the map.<br><br>Not to say that it shouldn&#39;t be sporked anyway if you can get a good story out of it, but it&#39;s wise not to treat trolls the same as real writers—that only encourages them.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>…I&#39;m inclined to think that this is real. See, when I first found this, I did a little background checking on the author. First of all, she has a My Immortal-esque Draco/OC fic. A troll chooses what will get the most reactions out of people, and with Harry Potter getting lots of reactions, why would you do Star Trek: Voyager? It&#39;s only well known among Trekkies. Secondly, I clicked on said fic to see how bad it was, and the first chapter was something to the effect of &quot;I&#39;m taking this down because no one likes it&quot; (although with worse spelling and a lot of !!!1!!!1) Trolls don&#39;t take their fics down, they would leave it up so more people could see it.<br>Besides, she did say something about having a &quot;lerning dinstability&quot;, which could explain some of the horrendous spelling.</p>

            <p><i>Presenting the second episode on the not-so-long-running series, (Un)Intelligence, featuring everybody&#39;s favourite Spies!<br><br>The PPC was originally created by Jay and Acacia. Harry Potter belongs to J.K. Rowling, The Counter-Strike series to Valve, Pokémon to Nintendo, and World One to itself.<br><br>I’d like to thank my beta readers firemagic, Lily Winterwood, KittyNoodles, and the Irish Samurai for their hard work.</i><br><br><p><font size="3"><b>Episode 2</b></font></p>
<br><br>“<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>”<br><br>Agent Yakov Minin lowered his wand and watched a little silvery armadillo scuttle across the floor. He was sitting on the storage chest in cubicle 5294 waiting for another fic to investigate along with Nasir and Gaspard. “Didja see that? Neat, eh?”<br><br>Gaspard, seated in front of the console (and looking uncomfortable on the mini-fridge: it was Angus’ place after all), smiled and said: “Well done sir, but shouldn’t you be filling out your reports instead of conjuring Patronuses?”<br><br>Yakov waved a bony hand in Gaspard’s direction as he pulled a bottle of Butterbeer from his battered travelling cloak. “I’ll do ‘em later. ‘Sides, this,” he gave the bottle a gentle shake, “is just waitin’ for me to drink it. Any of yew two want some?”<br><br>From his seat on the camping bed, Nasir shook his head. “Butter<i>beer</i> implies alcoholic content. I cannot drink this, Yakov.”<br><br>Gaspard too shook his head. “Perhaps later, sir? I’m currently thinking up some emergency plans. What are you going to do when a raging Sueified elephant rampages through HQ? It pays to be prepared, you know.”<br><br>Yakov sighed, transfigured an unopened stack of printer paper into a wooden mug, and poured himself a drink. He silently sipped his drink in the uncomfortable silence that followed his attempt at a conversation. He flicked his wand at the console, which tuned itself to PPC Radio 2. The music programme was currently broadcasting a live concert featuring the DBS Philharmonic Orchestra in New Caledonia. In between a waltz and a symphony, Yakov spoke up: “So... What does your Patronus look like, Nasir?”<br><br>The Arabic man took his eyes off of his clipboard full of paperwork and looked over to Yakov, who produced a Muggle-use wand from a pocket.<br><br>“I don’t know. I’ve only been able to cast non-corporeal Patronuses during training,” said Nasir. He stared at the wand for a few seconds. “May I?”<br><br>“Yeah, sure,” said Yakov as he handed the wand over to Nasir. “I don’t know about the other Muggle-use wands, but Penny tells me this one is a lot more sensitive than the others. ‘Course, all of the Muggle-uses aren’t as powerful as the real deal, but yew jus’ might be able to pull one off. Go on, try it.”<br><br>Nasir closed his eyes and focused. What made him happy? Several ideas immediately popped into his head. He remembered when he first saw Juliane, his Eevee-turned-Glaceon. He shook his head. That was the memory he used last time, and was only powerful enough for a shapeless silver mist. What else? He thought of the first time he stepped into Pallet Town, feeling the thrill of adventure right before his first Intel run. He squared his shoulders and pointed the wand at the ground.<br><br>“<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>” A thin silver mist escaped from the tip of the wand. This memory was too weak for any type of Patronus.<br><br>The Spy focused on another memory. This time, he was standing on the bridge of a sky ship during an Intel run. The thought of sailing across the sky on a ship held aloft by a flight stone and carried by the winds blowing over the Edge still gave him shivers of excitement. After muttering the incantation, the wand twitched but didn’t even produce a wisp of smoke. Next try: buying one by one the hard-earned components of his gaming rig and assembling the computer in his RC. His chest still swelled with pride at the thought: it had cost him several weeks’ worth of salary and hours of painstaking assembly. No response from the wand. Becoming the top Counter-Strike player in the All-HQ MLG Club. The wand fizzled but didn’t do anything else. After a couple of minutes trying different memories, Nasir lowered the wand and sighed.<br><br>“I don’t think I’ve got the right memories for a strong Patronus, Yakov. Sorry,” said Nasir as he offered the Muggle-use wand to Yakov. The Russian agent shook his head and leaned away from the wand.<br><br>“Nonsense, man. Everyone has got a Patronus-worthy memory in them. You’re jus’ not focusin’ on the right things. I think of my great-grandmother when I cast this spell, if that’s any help,” said Yakov. “Yew quit too easily, Nas. That’s always been one of yer things. Put your back into it, come on!”<br><br>Nasir grumbled in agreement and shifted his thoughts to his family. He remembered helping his mother and father build the café in New Caledonia right after moving in from Beirut. In his mind’s eye he saw their beaming faces, and felt how proud he was standing next to his parents as they looked at the two-storey building with large glass windows and a carved wooden sign reading <i>Sana’s Café</i>.  <br><br>“<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>” The fog was much thicker now-- thicker than all of his previous attempts had produced. Nasir even thought he saw something move within it.  <br><br>Yakov sat up and smiled. “Hey, not too shabby! Jus’ a lil’ bit more, you’re doing it!”<br><br>The Arab man nodded and focused. He was silent for a few seconds, then found the perfect memory. It was set in his parents’ café again, but this time he and his six other cubicle mates were enjoying a hearty meal. They had talked and eaten and laughed for a glorious hour just before the night shift. He remembered the setting sun casting orange light over their smiling faces, the smell and taste of the food piled in front of them, and... Agent Penny Chang, his long-time crush, sitting beside him.<br><br>He pointed his wand at the floor. “<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>”<br><br>A silvery hyena burst out of the wand, landing softly on the Generic Surface tiles. It padded around the limited floor space, looked at Nasir and Yakov, and sniffed at both the storage chest and the now-vacant mini-fridge. As Nasir let the memory fade from his mind, the hyena slowly dissolved into nothingness.<br><br>Nasir was ecstatic. “Yakov! Did you see that?”<br><br>Yakov took a swig of Butterbeer and nodded. “Sure did. I didn’t think ‘ee could vault that high, but he did.”<br><br>“What.”<br><br>“Didn’t yew see? As soon as he saw yer Patronus, Gaspard did this amazing jump up and over the cubicle wall. ‘Ow high is that thing anyways? Metre and a half... Metre seventy? Oh, and nice work with that spell, man. I knew yew had it in yew!”<br><br>Nasir sighed. “Thank you. You can come out now, Gaspard! The big scary thing with the teeth is gone.”<br><br>The junior agent peeked over a cubicle wall. “Sorry about that sir, but big things with sharp teeth spontaneously appearing beside people rarely mean any good.” A few seconds later he reappeared in the entrance to cubicle 5294 and retook his place at the console. Seconds later, it [BEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]ed loudly.<br><br>Gaspard slapped a button and started typing commands as he browsed through the preliminary report on the console’s monitor. “Gentlemen, it’s a mission for both of you. Harry Potter and Pokémon crossover, set at Hogwarts and with Harry replacing Ash Ketchum. Here are your transcripts, preliminary report, and some extra bottles of Bleeprin. I’ve taken the liberty of setting your disguises to Generic Gryffindor students for ease of access to their common room.”<br><br>Nasir absentmindedly put down the Muggle-use wand on the table. “Yeesh. Character supplantation... that doesn’t sound promising. Let’s go, Yakov. Run final equipment checks.”<br><br>As Nasir reviewed the portal settings, Yakov picked up the Muggle-use wand and offered it to Gaspard. “How about it? Wanna give it a go when we’re gone?”<br><br>The junior agent shook his head. “No thank you, sir. I’m fine.”<br><br>The Russian man winked and set the wand back down on the table. “Suit yourself. Have fun,” he said before following Nasir through the portal that had opened beside the console.<br><br>As soon as the portal closed, Gaspard stood up and walked over to the cubicle entrance and peered outside. Nobody in sight. He looked over the walls. There were no people in the adjacent cubicles either. Somebody seeing him slack off on the job wouldn’t do any favours for him. If Yakov and Nasir wanted to waste their time, fine, that was their choice. But for him...<br><br>The junior agent reached for the wand and muttered to himself: “Well, let’s see if several weeks of practice will pay off. I gotta remember to properly thank Yakov for finding a good wand.”<br><br>He closed his eyes, thought of the time he was chosen second-to-last during a gym class soccer match, and muttered “<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>”<br><br>He felt a surge go through the wand, followed by a tingling sensation in his wand arm. He’d done it! At last! He opened his eyes, searching for his Patronus. The cubicle was empty. He stood up, checked under the bed and table, behind the console, peeked over the cubicle walls, and even opened the chest in hopes of finding the animal. It was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>“Yeah. Fat lot of good that was,” grumbled the Spy as he tossed the wand back onto the table. “It’s not like I’ll ever be good at magic. I’ve probably got some rubbish animal as a Patronus. Maybe a slug or something.”<br><br>If he had bothered to look up when searching, Gaspard might have noticed a little silver hummingbird silently hovering overhead. <br><br>- - - - - - - - - -<br><br><i>Fun fact: Gaspard’s Patronus was to originally take the form of either a cross-eyed platypus, a fainting goat, or a slug. </i></p>

            <p>This brings back so many happy memories - two of my favourite fandoms to read about. =D Anything involving people finding out what their Patronuses are makes me feel warm and fuzzy. :3<br><br>Is that fic mentioned at the end real, by the way?

            <p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s not a real fic. It was designed to show that Nasir was the resident Pokémon expert while Yakov watched over Harry Potter.<br><br>I can tell you this: you can expect to see some Pokémon shenanigans in future episodes of (Un)Intelligence. Maybe something like a Glaceon-getting-lost-in-the-Cafeteria&#39;s-freezers (and watching Nasir and Penny go out to find her) kind of story.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m getting witchcraft and wizardry vibes from the group - subtle hints, and the like. &quot;Silly witch&quot;, the knot in the yarn, Colin&#39;s reaction, Wards being put up right as Ciara shows up, a seemingly mental link between Emma and the future to come, Trudie&#39;s constant speaking to the wind, it seems, at improper times...<br><br>Old fashioned magic, I&#39;ll assume? Before the idea of magic became such a grandiose notion?<br><br>I like it.<br><br>It seems, though, as if some characters are speaking in a jumble. You were good about listing who was speaking when, but at the point before Ciara appears in the story, and onwards, there are portions where it all seems to clutter up and cram for space rather than read coherently.<br><br>I might advise, in the case of such dialog as what occurred after Alan mentioned a Purushamriga, putting in something to space out the sudden influx of conversation. Emotional reactions aside, perhaps some more detailing of physical responses would help even things out there.<br><br>If I might plug an example of mine:<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a purushamriga,&quot; Alan said, sounding a bit defensive. His arms retracted to his torso, nearly folding the square inwards.<br><br>&quot;Gesundheit,&quot; Trudie said.<br><br>Now, this is just me, but do you notice that it seemed easier to transition from one speaker to the next during that small dialog? Maybe keep something like this in mind for future stories of this sort, and add your own twists where you feel they&#39;re needed.<br><br>Outside of that, there were only a few grammatical glitches that I took issue with.<br><br>Whether or not my advice was coherent is up to you. It&#39;s two in the morning where I am, and I&#39;m beat from long hours of traveling.</p>

            <p>The effect I&#39;m trying to go for is that, at first it seems like a normal gathering of old friends, but as it goes on it&#39;s revealed that there&#39;s something supernatural about them; seeing the future, hearing ghosts, one&#39;s a fairy, and so on. If anyone has any advice on how to improve the pacing and get that effect, maybe make things clearer without giving it all away too soon, I&#39;d really appreciate it.</p>

            <p>This was so funny! Homicidal Eledhwen (is that spelled right?) is really interesting to see, and oh, the poetic justice! I like how Cale compares Eledhwen and Christianne to Sherlock and John. And the Johnlock!

            <p>You can line up several missions at a time - just so long as none of them are left long enough to get sent back to the Unclaimed Badfic list. To avoid this, try working on as many as you can at the same time. (For instance, if you have missions lined up for more than one agent pair/trio, you might be able to do a mission for each group, simultaneously.)<br><br>Additionally, don&#39;t take too many missions. Don&#39;t completely wipe out the Unclaimed Badfic page, and don&#39;t take more than you can handle.<br><br>Like me: I&#39;ve claimed two or three fics at the moment to spork, because I can handle them and I know the missions will be finished by New Year&#39;s. I&#39;m also making myself wait until those are done before taking any more, because I don&#39;t want to overload my plate or seem like I&#39;m trying to outperform everyone (which is probably a silly thing to worry about, but that&#39;s me).<br><br>Hopefully this helps.</p>

            <p>Badfic in the Claimed list are moved back to Unclaimed after 18 months or so, IIRC, because most people tend to forget about them after that amount of time. I imagine that if you&#39;re planning to mission them and other stuff prevents you from doing so right now, re-Claiming them is kosher, but I&#39;m not sure.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got a table at a craft fair next month, and was thinking of adding stained glass nightlights to my inventory.  I put a couple together last night, trouble is I&#39;m not sure how to price them.

            <p>That the number of lights you&#39;ve made would be helpful. But without that information, I think $9-11 seems a more reasonable price range, based on the two you&#39;re showing us (which are lovely, by the way).</p>

            <p>For the bulb covers alone, you could easily go higher. Like, 20. That is perfectly reasonable.<br><br>For the whole stained glass nightlight, since it&#39;ll be lit up, if I&#39;m factoring in lighting effects and the thickness of the glass, I&#39;d say...

            <p>I was wondering: Say there&#39;s a Sue-fic out there that is really bad, but is also really really long. Like all the pleas for the author to stop writing merely land on deaf ears. Could a PPC mission be written in installments? I was thinking it could be kinda funny to write a saga about having to deal with one really bad story that just wouldn&#39;t end.<br><br>If not, could the agents just lose their minds and attack the Sue before reaching the end?</p>

            <p>We don&#39;t actually expect people to stop writing when we do missions to their work. Most of you probably know this, but between the talk of multi-part missions and going back to spork later chapters, I thought a reminder wouldn&#39;t hurt. We are not actual fandom police. People are still allowed to write their stories, whether we spork them or not. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh, trying to head off misconceptions that lead to ugliness when they occur.<br><br>P.S.

            <p>Granted, the fic itself has decent prose but it just keeps going and going and bloody going and even though Eledhwen and Christianne killed her way back at the pool which was like thirty chapters back from where the story is now, she just keeps racking up charges.<br>So I intend on writing a follow-up mission to deal with the new things (and to watch Eledhwen foam at the mouth now that I know she can).<br><br>Generally my rule of thumb is to kill the Sue at the first major break in Canon, which in this case was the pool in GAME where the Sue got kidnapped instead of John.

            <p>I think that you have to kill a Sue when there are enough charges. Usually that means waiting until the end of a fic, but in really long fics there might be enough charges a few chapters in. Takes Specs&#39;s example of My Immortal. It&#39;s a Legendary Badfic, so there might be enough charges in the first chapter alone. <br>Of course, for the sake of story, agents should stay in a fic long enough to go crazy or partially crazy.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to clarify just a teensy bit - I&#39;m feeling teacherly today~<br><br>First of all, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the quantity of the charges as it is the severity - the second an OC causes a major canon rapture (like, say, usurping the role of Ringbearer from Frodo), it becomes killable. Of course, other charges almost always pop up before the major one(s), and sometimes the agents also have to kill Cute Animal Friends or destroy Sue artifacts that pop up <i>after</i> the major rupture, and have to leave the main Sue(s) alive until they can get to those, too. Not only that, but most agents typically have to pick a time and place to do the Duty safely - it wouldn&#39;t be very wise to try killing a Sue when it&#39;s surrounded by the army of mooks it&#39;s leading, after all. Yet more charges can pop up while the agents are waiting for an opening.<br><br>Also, while it helps if your agents are a bit off their rockers (and tends to be really fun to <s>torment them</s> pit them against the horrors of badfic, at the end of the day, the purpose of any mission is to protect the canon(s) involved in the badfic getting sporked - not to drive your agents batty. That&#39;s just the proverbial shrapnel in the explosion. :D<br><br>Hopefully my information is relatively sound - I&#39;m still new myself, just significantly less shiny than y&#39;all.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s kind of what I meant, you just explained it better--basically, if you can justify kiling a Sue before the fic&#39;s end, you can kill them and end the mission there. Which would mean that you don&#39;t necessarily have to go through the entire badfic.<br>I agree that the main point is to protect the canon (we are the Protectors, after all), but another point of writing these missions is for entertainment. Say a Sue messes with your agent&#39;s Lust Object. Even if you could kill the Sue before, you might want to show that agent&#39;s reaction because it&#39;d be fun to read about. </p>

            <p>And here&#39;s a lackluster answer: yes.<br><br>Hee, nah, I wouldn&#39;t do that.<br><br>I&#39;ve read a number of two-part missions before, and I know of at least one mission that had to be split into numerous parts due to the writer of the badfic continuing to update post-sporkage.<br><br>Although if it&#39;s REALLY long, you could always seek help from other agents, and split the badfic up by giving certain chapters to each team of agents. I&#39;m fairly certain the same thing was attempted with &#39;S*bj*g*t**n&#39; (title censored due to its status as a Legendary Badfic that scared its would-be sporkers away).</p>

            <p>So, while beta-ing Kitty&#39;s mission, I suddenly blurted out, mid-Bleeprin overdose, &quot;There should be BleepNerds.&quot;<br><br>The conversation then degraded into how they will be crystallized Bleep and sugar, with a candy coating, and the colors will be Urple and Greenk (or Bleen, we&#39;re still undecided).<br><br>Kitty said that if this didn&#39;t already exist, I should make it an invention and then claim ownership.<br><br>I think I&#39;ll just put it up as a suggestion instead. Civilian!Specs discovered Bleeprin/Candy combo and gave it over to PPC science staff, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Thoughts? And is there a process for inventing new products, or does it just kinda ad-lib?</p>

            <p>So I was browsing around the wiki, and I have a few questions.<br>1. If within the fic, a Sue bleeds, does the blood we see also look sparkly? <br>2. Makes-Things: Dead or Alive?<br>3. What exactly is done if a Sue is pregnant?<br>4. Do PPC Agents like bubble wrap?</p>

            <p>1) Very sparkly. The amount of sparkle relates to the species of Sue, and the amount can be measured in GL, or Glitter Levels. Glitter can be dialysed from some Sues or Sueified Agents/OCs to render them normal again.<br>2) Makes-Things pulled a Reichenbach.<br>3) My Agents, since their fic&#39;s latest chapter had the Sue giving birth, merely sent her to Medical to get the baby born before killing her. Others use Embryo Extraction Kits and stuff.<br>4) Oooooooh yessssss.</p>

            <p>1) Yes indeed. Sue blood is loaded with Glitter.<br><br>2) He&#39;s alive, but nobody knows how he did it. Don&#39;t ask him either; he gets rather touchy about it.<br><br>3) I think an agent team once sent a Sue to Medical to deliver a baby. <br><br>4) Yes. Very much so.</p>

            <p>1) Sue blood sparkles.<br>2) Makes-Things is alive.  When asked about the rumors of his demise he responded, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure I would know if I was dead.&quot;<br>3) Embryo extraction kit.<br>4) Depends on the agent.  Some will love it.

            <p>I liked them all, but my favourite story from the set was definitely &#39;Ten Feet Tall&#39;. That&#39;s certainly one way of making sure your request for a raise doesn&#39;t get conveniently misfiled and then forgotten about! Also a particularly awesome song, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.<br><br>&#39;Fairytail&#39; also caught my attention, the description of the materialisation sounds seemed vaguely familiar and I was trying to work out what they referred to. The blue box was quite a big clue :)<br><br>One thing I did notice was a bit of dialogue that seemed odd to me, in &#39;Storybook&#39;, Serenity says &#39;&quot;If <u>we could</u> only <u>we could</u> walk together in Nouvelle-Caledonie, dine at Aujourd&#39;hui, watch the stars burn in their crysalline spheres...&quot; &#39; (emphasis added). Either &#39;If only we could walk together...&#39; or &#39;If we could only walk together...&#39; would make sense, but having &#39;we could&#39; in there twice just seems a little odd to me. Although I don&#39;t know Serenity/Selene&#39;s character well enough to know if she has what I would consider odd speech patterns.<br></p>

            <p>(I think that title has too many dashes...)<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m in the process of... -deep inhale- ...re-re-re-<i>re</i>-writing an original series I&#39;ve wanted to write and publish for a good six or seven years, now, and (having recently moved from my hometown and relocating a good three- or four hours south) am currently cut off from all but one of my previous beta-readers as a result... at least until I get everyone&#39;s addresses memorized.<br><br>Which, as with mathematical rules and facts about the science of weather and cellular structure, is probably going to take me forever, and I&#39;ve already lost my address book. -facedesk-<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m posting this long and convoluted thread to ask if anyone here would be interested in beta-ing my story for me. You don&#39;t have to beta the whole thing - you can help with just a paragraph, if&#39;n you want - but if anyone is interested, I&#39;m really concerned with characterization (especially with making sure none of my characters fall to Suedom), writing voice, wangst-prevention (the story is not a comedy, but I also don&#39;t want it to be a wangst-fest and there&#39;s a character or two who might veer into that if I&#39;m not careful), and racial characterization (there is a sentient, non-human race at the core of the story... actually the non-human race pretty much IS the story...)<br><br>It&#39;s going to be on Gdocs for the writing- and beta stages, so if anyone&#39;s interested, please let me know your email so I can send it to you.<br><br>Thankies for taking a peek at my request! -bows too low and falls over- Dang it...</p>

            <p>I could try. A lot of the questions weren&#39;t mine to begin with, so I could probably cut out fifty percent and give it to you that way.<br><br>It&#39;ll take a while, though - I didn&#39;t save the questions in template format, so I&#39;ll have to edit the whole finished product from its file on my phone, and word processors hate me.<br><br>Personally, I like doing the ones where you make up a TV Tropes page for your characters, but interview type things are fun too. I might do one with a different character from a different story next.</p>
