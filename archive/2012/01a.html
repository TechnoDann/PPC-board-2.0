            <p>Am crossing my fingers and wishing really hard.<br><br>Name: Veronica Banks<br>Age: Fifteen<br>Sex: Female<br>Background: Veronica is a Real Person who accidentally followed an agent who was portaling very sloppily. Once inside the HQ (and once the freak-outs and explanations were over), she professed an interest in joining. After going through intermittent and sometimes ridiculous training, Veronica completed her first mission. In this mission, she ended up recruiting Lisa.<br>Personality: While fairly cheerful, Veronica can be very shy at times. She has a love for all animals and is generally very kind, which is why she can sometimes have trouble killing Sues. Don&#39;t be fooled, though-when provoked, Veronica has a bit of a nasty streak.<br>Appearance: Veronica has short blonde hair in a bob. She wears small, rectangular glasses. She generally covers her hair up with a black bandana or cap. Veronica also wears a lot of black.<br><br>Name: Lisa Frick<br>Age: Thirteen<br>Sex: Female<br>Background: Lisa is a bit-character from a badfic set in the Young Wizards continuum. She was recruited when Veronica took on a solo mission in her badfic. After getting all the preliminary training and preparation, she was assigned to Veronica. Lisa is a wizard in training, she knows a few spells and some of the Speech, but not a lot.<br>Personality: Lisa can be extremely kick-butt and stubborn, when she isn&#39;t busy being a fangirl or coming up with extremely bad ideas to try out. She is also very clumsy and has the bruises to prove it. <br>Appearance: Lisa has bright red hair always tied in a messy ponytail. She tends to wear generic t-shirts and jeans.<br><br>Fanfic to spork: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7505022/1/How_The_Doctor_changed_my_life"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7505022/1/How_The_Doctor_changed_my_life">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7505022/1/How_The_Doctor_changed_my_life</a></a><br>Writing sample: <a href="http://thescribeppc.webs.com/apps/blog/show/11341554-permission-request-meeting"><a href="http://thescribeppc.webs.com/apps/blog/show/11341554-permission-request-meeting">http://thescribeppc.webs.com/apps/blog/show/11341554-permission-request-meeting</a></a>-<br><br>Thank you very much.

            <p>I noticed that in your story Veronica said that Lisa would fade away due to not being a canon character when the fic ended. <br>I&#39;d just like to say that if OCs and bit characters haven&#39;t perpetrated crimes against canon and would fit in, Sue or no Sue, these characters would simply be assimilated into the world as if they&#39;d been there their entire lives. <br></p>

            <p>Like July said, I&#39;ve got a few questions relating to YW-verse.<br><br>First, if Lisa&#39;s a wizard-in-training, has she gone through her Ordeal yet? I guess I&#39;d be lying if I said the prospect of <i>that</i> coming up in the course of a future mission didn&#39;t intrigue me. One of the things I really like about YW is that the PTBs can plausibly turn up anywhere, including other canons (though, in LotR, for instance, given that Morgoth is trapped in the Void, it&#39;s probably safe from any personal appearances by the Lone One). On the other hand, given that a wizard&#39;s Ordeal can a big freaking deal, occasionally world-changing, I&#39;m a little leery, too. Do you have ideas about handling that, or has Lisa already gone through it? If she has gone through it, what happened? That&#39;s an important thing to know for a wizard character. Also, what does the Lone One look like to her? As I recall, It&#39;s supposed to look different to everyone (though I think even Diane Duane forgets this for convenience).<br><br>Second, new wizards have a lot more power at their disposal than more seasoned ones. I can tell you&#39;re making sure to limit how much she can do, so I&#39;m not too concerned about that—actually the opposite. The nature of YW-verse is such that I&#39;d really expect its magic to work anywhere, though of course the wizard would have to become intimately acquainted with a given world&#39;s name in the Speech in order to be effective at casting in it. I think the mechanics of YW-verse magic are limiting enough themselves, as long as they&#39;re borne firmly in mind and respected. I&#39;d hate to see it nerfed beyond that.<br><br>Third, I am a little concerned about Lisa herself, based on the RP. While the fire was going on, Lisa tried putting it out and failed, and then this happened: &quot;Lisa swore and went to go off and collapse on a couch. Maybe eat a cookie. She didn&#39;t really want to deal with other people&#39;s problems right now. Particularly when she was so new to magic.&quot;<br><br>Wizards are supposed to be combating entropy—Lisa agreed to it when she took the Wizard&#39;s Oath—and an indoor fire that could end up with people getting hurt or even killed seems to fall solidly into that category. &quot;Dealing with other people&#39;s problems&quot; is part of the contract, so her willingness to leave everyone to their fate really worries me, new to magic or not. As I recall, that sort of attitude can get a wizard stripped of the ability to use magic, and probably any memory of having been able to do so.<br><br>I see two options here: One, you&#39;re running with this characterization. If that&#39;s the case, I will expect a reckoning for her carelessness with the power she&#39;s been granted. If she doesn&#39;t take her Oath seriously, she&#39;s in big trouble.<br><br>Two, that was a fluke, and I will expect her to behave like a wizard.<br><br>On more of a side-note, I sort of assume her work in the PPC would be official errantry, since badfic is definitely a force for entropy (and one even the Lone Power may not like much, at that), but that doesn&#39;t mean other commissions can&#39;t come up. Since conflicts between one job and another could be really interesting, I&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve thought about it.<br><br>I think that&#39;s everything I wanted to say. I also second July&#39;s specific comments about the writing sample, though I&#39;ll note that solo missions <i>do</i> happen, if not generally to very new recruits. Still, they aren&#39;t encouraged or the norm, for the reasons July gave.<br><br>~Neshomeh, also holding off on a yea or nay for the time being.</p>

            <p>That was definitely just a fluke. I tend to not put as much work into RP posts as I do for actual stories (bad habit, I know), and I wasn&#39;t sure whether or not I could change events that much.<br><br>I was planning to have her already have gone through her Ordeal, since I wasn&#39;t sure how you would handle that sort of thing here. I may change my mind if I can figure out a way to work it in, but my mind is currently blank on that subject. My basic plan was for her Ordeal to have been in the one-on-one vein, since she&#39;s pretty aggressive in the terms of magic usage.<br><br>And yes, her missions would definitely be official errantry. I may add some interludes with her more &quot;normal&quot; wizarding work in... I need to reread the series first, so that won&#39;t be for a while.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to go ahead and grant permission. I&#39;m interested in your characters, and I think you&#39;ll figure out the various PPC things brought up here with some more reading of other missions and around the wiki.

            <p>1) Line breaks between paragraphs are your friends. They help the reader to differentiate between paragraphs when indentation is not used as part of the formatting. <br><br>2) Paragraph indentation is also your friend, but is usually not done on online documents due to the use of the tab key for other functions.<br><br>3) Sending solo agents out on missions isn&#39;t done. Spies- the agents from Intelligence- are solo, but their role is different from those who actively take charges and are close to the Sue and canons while doing their work. Agents are in pairs because a) it usually prevents them from doing something that is entirely idiotic or against the rules, b) putting two incompatible or clashing personalities into roles that force them to work together is funny, c) everyone needs help sometimes and a single agent with no backup does not stand a chance against a Sue or Stu who catches them unawares or is not caught unawares.  Beyond that, the PPC would certainly never send a completely green agent out on a first mission alone. That is tantamount to sending them out to either die unpleasantly, or realize the opportunity they have been given and never returning and living a mostly quiet life in the world of one of their favorite canons.<br><br>4) There is no four.<br><br>5) Show. Do not tell. You did a great deal of &#39;tell&#39; here in your sample. It doesn&#39;t convey anything. You are telling us what we are supposed to get out of your sample, rather than leaving it to be interpreted or up to the actions of your characters to evoke something. Being told things is not interesting, at all, in the realm of fiction. We read to learn and discover. The reason fanfiction is something so many of us read and write is because the books we read- when they are good- show things, so we can come up with our own interpretation of the reasons behind their actions and their motivations and so on. Telling leaves nothing to interpret. It is cut and dry. It is not engaging.<br><br>As an example, from your own piece:<br><br><i>“Well, you know. That’s life.” Veronica sipped her coffee. “But yeah… I’d like a partner…”<br>“Well…” Lisa felt very awkward all of a sudden. “I mean… you said you would have to recruit me.”</i><br><br>Changing it to show- but get across the same intent you are trying to do with telling results in the following: <br><br><i>“Well, you know. That’s life.” Veronica sipped her coffee. “But yeah… I’d like a partner…”<br><br>“Well…” Lisa fidgeted in her chair, rubbing the back of her neck. She didn&#39;t meet Veronica&#39;s eyes, instead looking down at the table. “I mean… you said you would have to recruit me.” </i><br><br>You can see the difference here, yes?<br><br>6) You have quite a few repetitive sentences in your writing sample. You have two sentences that begin with &#39;As&#39; in consecutive order, and three more following it none too long after. This is noticeable. Readers notice this sort of thing. It is jarring. <br><br>7) In regards to your agents:<br><br>i) The uniform is black and the relevant department flashpatch unless it is Medical, who have armbands. That is what the uniform consists of: clothing- if the agent wears clothing- that is black, and a flashpatch.<br><br>ii)ll agents consider themselves real people. Of course they&#39;re real people, what else would they be? The term we use for agents that are from what is ostensibly is the real world is to say that they are from World One. <br><br>iii) Nice to see some younger agents again.<br><br>iv) As to Lisa, I believe that Neshomeh had some items she wanted to say or something. I&#39;m not sure. I will leave it to her discretion to comment and elaborate and actually say whatever it is she was intending to say rather than speculating.<br><br><br><br>I&#39;m going to err on the side of withholding permission, given what I have said above and the reasoning included in each section. That said, I suggest reading more missions and spending more time reading relevant side materials on the wiki and asking people questions when you have any. <br><br></p>

            <p>Sorry about the solo thing. I guess I wasn&#39;t really thinking. I thought I&#39;d read a couple of missions with solo agents (because of recently retired or missing partners, I suppose), but I may be mixing that up with some other series I&#39;ve read recently. I read way too much, and so get things mixed up a lot. Again, sorry, that was kind of a dumb mistake to make.<br><br>Ah. Clothing. Woopsy-daisy. I knew that. Head, meet desk.

            <p>Is that from an actual badfic?<br><br>That&#39;s because my Agents too have a mini from MGLN (I wanted a mini Nanoha to blow up their RC regularly), and back then I said that Nanoha Takamichi was a mini-Unison Device.<br><br>However, since I actually didn&#39;t do any MGLN-based mission, it&#39;s sort of unofficial. If you have actually got a MGLN badfic in your hands, you get to decide what MGLN minis are. (And I&#39;ll edit a couple wiki articles and mission to match that. In most cases, it&#39;s a single word to change)</p>

            <p>No, I made up the Alicia Testarossa replacement story (I really doubt that anyone who knew what an imaginary space is could write about someone escaping them.)<br><br>Can the mini-Unisons actually, y&#39;know, Unison? Also, I think that minis are supposed to be an iconic monster or character, and while I love Rein and Agito, they&#39;re not exactly iconic or monsterish. On the other hand, the Berserk Defense Program is a great villain (if you can count it as one, since it&#39;s probably not even sentient) from the season that most people like. <br><br>I do, in fact, have a Nanoha badifc lined up (Animist and the Anarchist..ugh) which has the misspelling of &quot;Hacken Form,&quot; so mini-Berserks were my plan for that.</p>

            <p>First: We do not leave characters from a canon- even Sues- to their fate in another canon. Especially not one that can be construed or is a torturous fate. If you remember in TOS, they got in trouble for shoving a Sue to be taken care of by Discworld elves, who are by no means nice or lovely and are incidentally avid carnivores.<br><br>Second note: Your request has a few paragraphs that don&#39;t have line break between them, such as that at the beginning. <br><br>&#39;“Alicia-tan?” asked Yuuno, staring into her deep red orbs. “Huh? Oh, it’s nothing, Yuuno...” she replied, trying to ignore the snickering behind her--probably Vita or Nanoha, they were always spying on her and trying to steal Yuuno for themselves.&#39; This should be two different paragraphs. New speaker, new paragraph. <br><br>Third note: The dialogue for Flowers is italicized. You did not do that in your sample.<br><br>That said, your writing is fairly crisp, and direct. There&#39;re no spelling errors, and only a few grammatical ones that your betas did not catch. <i>&#39;Ah, thanks, Lana. She’s awake, so we may as well get this over with.” replied the familiar without turning around.&#39; The second sentence in that line of dialogue should end with a comma.

            <p>In all honesty, I don&#39;t really like the zerg playstyle. Too much focus on constant pressure and unit production in my opinion. I prefer to cower behind bunkers, missile turrets and siege tanks and just wait for my opponent to dash him/herself against my defenses before launching a counterattack. Also, mass Marine + Stim counters everything, hehe. <br>Protoss is fun, but you have virtually no map control in the early game, which can prove fatal.</p>

            <p>...I&#39;m still in practice league (and getting my rear end handed to me) but from what I&#39;ve seen, a good BB is something even a fully walled in Terran will have trouble defending against.

            <p>Siege Tanks break apart Banelings pretty easily, actually AoE one-shotting them in siege mode, helped by the fact that it takes 7-9 Banelings to kill one.<br><br>Siege Tank/Raven is a great anti-burrow combo if the burrowers don&#39;t have flying support.

            <p>They can be pretty game-changing in situations like this. There was one live stream I was watching where a 3-base zerg managed to take down a 5-base protoss with an Infestor build. Infestors NP&#39;d the Colossi and reduced the Protoss ball to ashes. Most amazing/scariest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  </p>

            <p>Yeah, they&#39;re terrifying if they&#39;re allowed to NP any of the end game units, because NP doesn&#39;t have a maximum duration, and nobody expects their units to attack them.

            <p>Some of you may know this from the IRC, but I have found a really bad Batman badfic. I&#39;ve ranted about it a lot already, so i&#39;ll spare you all another round of me yelling about the stupidity in this fic.<br><br>It&#39;s gone on for 19 chapters so far, and (at the time of writing) has 104 reviews, all of them good. Infact, I would like to point out what one reviewer wrote:<br><br>&quot;I have been following your story for the longest time and just had to say something when I read this chapter! Beth is easily the best Riddler OC out there, no one can even come close :) she matches him like the jagged pieces of a jigsaw puzzle come together.<br><br>A lot of people can try to create mary sues for him -like I&#39;ve seen a bit too often on this site- but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to look at Mr. Nigma with anyone but here again.&quot;<br><br>There are plenty more talking about how &quot;in character&quot; the Riddler is in this fic.<br><br>This fic is so bad, that I LITERALLY headdesked when I got to chapter 14...And yet, it feels like there&#39;s still hope for the story. <br><br>For all the OOCness that The Riddler and Batman suffer, Batgirl and Robin seem pretty In character( I don&#39;t know that much about them, but according to someone who does, what they do checks out) and there is one chapter that is written pretty well. It sort of feels like, with a bit of practice, the author could become a pretty good writer.<br><br>That being said, i&#39;m faced with a dilemma. See, this fic makes me really really angry. I&#39;m disgusted that someone who loves the character of the Riddler so much could mangle his character like this. I hate that the main character is a Mary Sue and that NO ONE seems to have been able to recognize this.<br><br>I want to leave a review for this fic, because on the author&#39;s profile, there&#39;s a little message asking if one of her other OCs is a Sue. I haven&#39;t read that OC&#39;s story, but that character does make a cameo as The Scarecrow&#39;s wife. However that&#39;s beside the point. What i&#39;m trying to say is that going off of this, it looks to me like the author cares whether or not her characters are Sues.<br><br>I&#39;m really motivated to leave a review, pointing out that the main character is a Sue and that The Riddler is horribly out of character. There are two problems with this plan.<br><br>The first is that i&#39;m scared that if I do point out these things, that the author will fix the fic, depriving me of mission material. Then I feel guilty about thinking that, and how them improving their skills is more important than me having a mission. I think that this is partially the reason why I haven&#39;t already left a review.<br><br>The rest of the reason is problem two: I don&#39;t actually know HOW to write a review very well.<br><br>Can anyone here please give me some pointers?<br><br>This is the fic by the way:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406454/1/Alls_Fair_in_Love_and_Riddles"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406454/1/Alls_Fair_in_Love_and_Riddles">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406454/1/Alls_Fair_in_Love_and_Riddles</a></a> </p>

            <p>...is really, <em>really</em> hard. Mostly, listen to what&#39;s been said: it&#39;s pretty much all solid. In general, when I review bad or simply somewhat shaky fic, I try to remain absolutely clear. If you&#39;re concerned about the quality of the review--in either content or phrasing--I&#39;d also suggest getting the review beta-read by someone who A) has some knowledge of the canon in question, B) probably takes the time and pain of reading the fic, and C) will be as honest with you as you want to be with the author. It probably is more tactful to avoid calling the character a Sue outright, and I agree with VM&#39;s reason of not using it due to vague definition far more than anything else. (Keep in mind that I am, in general, far more confrontational as a reviewer than I should be.)<br><br>One of the hardest things I&#39;ve found to deal with in the DCU in particular is that so many writers have worked on it that defining &quot;OOC&quot; can be difficult beyond belief, but if it&#39;s <em>truly</em> that bad, just be prepared to cite sources. I&#39;m sure if the author has betas at all, then he/she/thing is convinced they&#39;re fantastic, but it never hurts to offer a few suggestions about what to look for in a Beta.<br><br>As for the mission material thing: as Neshomeh said, that&#39;s no reason not to review. It may <em>delay</em> things, mind, especially if the author really does improve. Plus, wanting to do this is... really nice and incredibly admirable of you, and that&#39;s always worth it.<br><br>Oh yeah, and you&#39;re looking at the <em>DCU</em>. The Badfic will never end and is probably deep enough to do diving contests in. I&#39;ve been afraid to dip my feet in for fear of Death or Permanent Mental Damage. That said: if you ever want a partner along for the ride with one? I am going to be horribly selfish and self-serving and offer to hop on-board. *sheepish*</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve felt the same way in the past, but I&#39;m with VM: go ahead and review, and if the author receives it well and makes improvements, ask for their permission to spork the old version. It would be in poor taste to spork it after improvements have been made without the author&#39;s consent. If they&#39;re really making an effort, there&#39;s no sense dwelling on past mistakes.<br><br>On the other hand, if they turn out to be unreceptive and act like a jerk about it, spork away.<br><br>It can be disappointing to lose materials, but remember that there&#39;s always more badfic out there. If you end up not being able to spork this one, something else will come along, and you&#39;ll have done a good deed by promoting goodfic rather than just thrashing badfic. Fear of losing PPC material shouldn&#39;t deter you from reviewing. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If this fic is ALREADY bad, right now, and you don&#39;t need it to be &#39;finished&#39; to spork it (as in, if you sporked it you could get a good story out of the &#39;badness&#39; with rising action -&gt; climax -&gt; falling action) what you can do is copy the text of the fic as it is right now and THEN leave the review.<br><br>If she changes the story, you have a snapshot of the badness as it is at this exact moment. If she does end up fixing it, that can even be written into the sporking, too! Remember, Spidey3000 was handled by his own author in the past.<br><br>I don&#39;t think by sporking it you&#39;d disrespect the author if she improves. If the current, unedited work is genuinely terrible, and it&#39;s the Sue, not the author... As long as you spork it with respect for the author and in the spirit of the PPC/in good humor it should be fine. At least in my eyes.</p>

            <p>He&#39;s a pretty special case. It wasn&#39;t a matter of him improving the story and being okay with PPCing an old version—he&#39;d already completely abandoned the story and decided he was okay with it being PPC&#39;d before I found out about it. I still asked for his permission to spork it and to include him in the mission, though. I think it would be inherently disrespectful to go behind someone&#39;s back and spork an old work when they&#39;re doing their best to improve in the present, especially if you&#39;re helping them with one hand and sporking with the other.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If you are talking about it in-universe (characters talking about a mission) it is the Sue that is responsible for everything that happens in the story.  If you are talking about it outside of the universe of the PPC (on the Board, for instance), then the buck stops at the author.<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed the tendency among some Boarders to blame the Sue for everything, instead of holding the author responsible for what they write.  That basically amounts to blaming the hamburger for the heart attack, rather than blaming the choices that led to the hamburger.  This is possibly done to avoid bashing the author, which we had a rash of a while back.  However, there is a difference between bashing (If the author thinks that is how the character acts then they are an idiot) and criticizing (The author&#39;s depiction of the character was really off).<br><br>You&#39;ve done a really good job, in your post, of criticizing the work without bashing the author.  If you keep that up in your review, you should be fine.</p>

            <p>You could leave an honest review, letting the author know what problems you have perceived in her story and tips on how to fix them, and then PM or ask her by review if she minds if you PPC the older version.<br><br>As for the Sue thing-- it&#39;s possible to point out the flaws in the character without calling her a Sue. That&#39;s become such a loaded term it can be hard to use without any kind of issues, partly because the criteria are so vague. Instead, focus on why the character doesn&#39;t work, and how the Riddler is off character-- and how the two are related.<br><br>Leaving good reviews isn&#39;t always easy, but if the author takes crit well, it can be really satisfying. Mostly just be honest-- &quot;You&#39;ve got issues here, here, and here, but you&#39;re doing this well and I think if you fix this, this, and that, the story could come off a lot better.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a pain, but we are here to promote goodfic, not just slash badfic. And it does get easier to write stuff like that with practice-- like anything else, the more you do it, the better you get. Good luck, San.</p>

            <p>Many authors tend to make gritty versions of the lighthearted and innocent fandoms that the world can offer. They&#39;re probably aiming on making cute things into badass versions of their former selves... which spectacularly fails on daily term basis and earns the hate of every fans, purists and moderates.</p>

            <p>Not to say the fanbase is bad, or any individual fan is bad, or that we can assume the exact motives of any given fan writer. But I think this kind of phenomenon is comparable to when something, say a book, comes out as a movie. Suddenly you have a vast new fanbase, and as a result, a fanfic explosion.<br><br>A lot of the pony fan community, I think, is still trying to hammer out its identity and reconcile the fact that many of them came from places totally different from pony. Hence a lot of tone and canon clashes that go beyond just stylistic interpretation.<br><br>For Lord of the Rings, the fandom issue was &#39;I have never read the books, but I saw the movie once and want to write about it!&#39; <br>For pony, it might be, &#39;I rarely delve into a setting this lighthearted and now I need to adapt from writing about zombie apocalypse to writing about Rainbow Dash and baked goods.&#39;<br><br>Of course, it&#39;s wrong to assume this holds for all people or all fans, or that we can assume any individual fan motive. But this does seem to be a trend...</p>

            <p>That MLP needs a little more action and violence. The author thinks that this is a good idea to make cute and lighthearted characters to kill and do some unspeakably violent stuff onto others but it&#39;s not. Sure, s/he has done a great job in writing it properly but that&#39;s just it, the plot behind the fanfic is horrible enough that it&#39;s making me cry. <br><br>The author must have ignored a lot of rules in fanfic writing and his conscience that tells him to stop writing it. S/he calls it art, I call it a huge, steaming pile of turd. It&#39;s available for sporking but someone might lose their minds in the process.</p>

            <p><br><br>Okay, first of all, I want to say I rather enjoyed the story; the characterization was lovely, as were all the little side details. <br><br>Things like Jenni actually aging just to match what Henry would expect, and Suicide and his interesting choice of shirts were lovely, and added to the overall feeling of the piece within the theme of most Ten Years Hences.<br><br>However, as I mentioned before, I was disappointed with the writing here in some parts. Normally the things you and Tungsten write are rather high quality- solo or together- but you both left a lot of rough spots to the point that while it was a lovely story, the overall writing made it seem more likely a lightly edited roleplay. <br><br>Roughly the point when Henry admits that he said &#39;some stuff&#39; is around when these rough points begin to kick in.<br><br><i>&quot;You already said some stuff?&quot; Suicide repeated. The kid was laying it on kind of thick, but he also had a point. Suicide&#39;s partners might go insane a lot, but they had one of the lowest rates of mutilating injury in the PPC—mainly because he took all the damage himself. Henry would probably be safe if he trained with Suicide . . . wait a second. &quot;I&#39;m being manipulated, aren&#39;t I,&quot; he said dryly, finishing off his kefir. &quot;You Robinsons are good at that. And said what stuff?&quot;<br><br>Henry cringed. Mouthing off always seemed like a good idea at the time, but once you stopped being angry it didn&#39;t take long to turn into guilt. Now Su&#39;d caught him trying to flatter his way out of it to boot, which was even worse. &quot;Well . . . she wasn&#39;t listening. Or she was listening to the wrong things, and . . . &quot; Suicide didn&#39;t look impressed with the excuses. Henry took a deep breath and plunged into it. &quot;I might&#39;ve sortakinda saidshewasaSue.&quot; He stared at a spot on the floor slightly to the right. </i><br><br>For several paragraphs, from this section on, the POV and accompanying narration rapidly switch back and forth. There was also an awkward mix of show and tell that would have worked better if the piece was entirely from one POV, but as it stands, it was being used as the sort of shortcut you see in RPs- getting the most information across to the other player in as quickly an accessible way as you can without breaking the narration or going out of character. <br><br>While it works well in RP, it can be a bit confusing with other works, and I did occasionally feel like it was hitting me over the head here, because the moment one portion that was backing Henry&#39;s POV was done hopping up and down to arract my attention, I was getting hit up the head with Suicide&#39;s rather straightforward end of things. <br><br>This whole section was lackng in transitions to smooth that sort of jerkiness, which was somewhat strange. Your writing style and Tungsten&#39;s normally complement each other and blend well, but this story was lacking in those usual smooth transitions, which again, helped to contribute to it reading, overall, like it was a lightly edited RP.<br><br>That said, the later portion of the story, with Jenni and Suicide interacting didn&#39;t quite suffer from the same rough POV switches, the mix of show and tell, and lack of transitions. This is possibly because Suicide&#39;s background POV information had already been filled and added in during his conversation with Henry, so there wasn&#39;t as much of a hard toss happening.<br><br><br>Beyond that, again, I did enjoy the story, I just think it should have been- and I was expecting it to be- somewhat more smoothly written technically, given the writers. <br><br>Also, this has completely reminded me I need to add my TYH to the wiki article there.<br></p>

            <p>Having thought about it since we talked, I do see what you mean. I guess we&#39;ve been doing enough RP-style stuff that it slipped in; plus, I&#39;m just starting to feel out Henry&#39;s character, so I was probably explaining things for my own benefit as much as anyone else&#39;s. That would account for there being less of an issue in the later J &amp; S segment.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ll know what to watch out for in the next co-write, so hopefully I can be more proactive about avoiding RP-style exposition.

            <p>As of right now, I intend for this to be canon for my characters, but of course it could change. Heck, the whole intent of this piece changed between when I first started writing it and now, thanks to Suicide&#39;s appearance in Jenni and Henry&#39;s life. Originally, Henry wanted nothing to do with being an agent and was quite a bit less well-adjusted.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m pretty sure Ilraen will end up being an agent trainer eventually, but I don&#39;t actually know what becomes of Nume in the future—whether he dies, retires, loses it, or what—or exactly when, so that&#39;s a bit vague on purpose.<br><br>Guess we&#39;ll just have to hang around for the next seven years or so and find out! {X D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I believe in a case where there is no description of the character, the dummy would look like a dummy.  In the case of a second-person fic, it could look like whoever is looking at it.  For instance, if you and I were both looking at it, I would see myself and you would see yourself.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been going over some missions involving bad slash, and I&#39;ve noticed something curious about Sue-Wraiths and regular Sues. With regular Sues (if &quot;regular&quot; is the proper term), it is possible for them to be recruited instead of killed, if they have the makings of an actual personality and decent spelling and grammar in their &quot;stories&quot;. However, regardless of how well-written the story is or how developed the characters&#39; personalities are, any Sue-Wraiths are promptly destroyed without a second thought.<br><br>Why is this so? Is it because it is impossible for a Sue-Wraith to be redeemed, or is it simply because nobody&#39;s ever thought of trying to recruit them?</p>

            <p>In addition, Sue-Wraiths often have few qualities of their own, and are merely sparkles layered over another character in the case of possession. Many recruited Sues, once the sparkles are stripped away, have at least a few traits of their own that may become seeds for an eventually-realized personality. Strip the sparkles out of a wraith, many times, and you are left with well... nothing. In cases of Possession, the Wraith is what an agent aims to remove.<br><br>In cases of POV situations and use of dummies... I dunno. Maybe you could seal one inside a golem? But the thing is that in those cases, the wraiths are locked into &#39;I&#39; and &#39;You&#39; and may be dangerous for other agents to interact with.  Most agents live in third-person POV. A character that exists only in first or second person POV may not even be able to interact with others in HQ.</p>

            <p>I believe the reason Wraiths are not recruited is that they require a body in order to do anything.  So, if you were to recruit one, you would have to supply a body for it or it would dissipate.  Then, once a body was supplied, you would have to find a way to feed it.  Since they live off of the emotional energies of the beings they possess, it would be difficult to find a sustained source of nourishment.<br><br>Long story short, it is very unlikely that one could be recruited.</p>

            <p>You see, I had this crazy notion that the Sue-Wraith, if it possessed a strong enough grip on reality to realize what it had done, and expressed a wish to hang on and atone, it could change into a regular ghost (or the canon&#39;s equivalent of a regular ghost), and survive that way. <br><br>Of course, that raises the question of whether or not a ghost could be recruited. I&#39;m guessing not, but I&#39;m not entirely sure.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to be somewhat blunt with you, so I apologize if my tone seems somewhat harsh at times. It&#39;s nothing personal, it&#39;s just the way I sometimes approach these things. I apologize in advance if I cause you offense in some way.<br><br>First off, I’m not going to bother talking about the length of the piece. Enough people have already brought up that particular point in this thread, so there’s no point in retreading that path. I’ll just say that I agree with JulyFlame and Joe on that point and move on.<br><br>A major sticking point for me was the way the Stu was used. For all his abilities and blustering, I never felt like the Stu was any threat to your agents. Even when he was torturing Cindy, I wasn’t really that concerned. Part of that was probably due to the fact that you picked an easy ‘leaves no marks’ kind of torture for him to use. Add that to how easily Cindy seemed to bounce back and the whole thing felt like something of a copout. If you want to show how tough a villain is by having them torture a hero, you’ve got to be willing to take off the hero’s plot armor, at least for a little bit. A few scars build character.<br><br>The final climactic battle was even worse in regards to the strength of the Stu. You spent the story touting the Stu up as a huge threat, but in the end he falls to a few well-placed spells/biotic abilities. The agents even have time to interrupt each other during the reading of the charge list in that typically amusing PPC fashion. They should know that the petrifying charm has a time limit, and that when it wears off the Stu will try to kill them, and yet they proceed as normal.<br><br>That falls in line with what I saw as a problem with pacing. Any dramatic tension that might be produced by the torture scene or by the Stu or by the C-Sec agent (I&#39;ll mention him again later) is undone by the story just plodding along like any other mission. This isn&#39;t a typical mission plotline, but you write it like one. What should be gripping becomes boring.<br><br>I also never saw this Stu as being more intelligent than any other garden variety example of his ilk, despite what you said in your first post. More powerful, sure. But an intelligent Stu or Sue would know how to torture someone properly (i.e., until they get the information they want) instead of just until the victim passes out. An intelligent Stu/Sue wouldn’t just throw attack after attack at a shield; he/she would try to find some way around it. [PERSONAL OPINIONS/HEAD CANON]A <i>really</i> intelligent Stu/Sue might even know what the PPC is. To have an ‘intelligent’ Stu or Sue who doesn’t know what the PPC is, considering that our own canon includes such things as Mary Sue Factories and the like, doesn’t quite sit well with me. Plus, having an enemy that knows what you are and what you can do makes that enemy a little more threatening, at least in my mind.[END OF PERSONAL OPINIONS/HEAD CANON]<br><br>While the romantic subplot with Xanthus and Annie was nice, it felt a bit shoehorned into this mission. Had it been contained within its own interlude, then both it and this mission would have likely been improved. That being said, the <i>sub</i>-subplot with the C-Sec investigator Gaston was wrapped up in a clumsy manner, what with him basically vanishing as soon as Annie shooed him away from the door. He was more plot device than character and it shows. <br><br>This mission is a mess. It has its areas of polish, to be sure – your characterization of Thane was fantastic – but those moments were buried under poor pacing and an underwhelming threat.</p>

            <p>The length issue, is something I&#39;ll have to keep in mind for future missions.<br><br>Everything else... Well... I ended up taking my mission to extensive rewrites, attempting to address most of your problems. All said and done, you touched on a few things that I myself kind of agreed with, so I decided &quot;eh, I think I&#39;ll take most of the mission under the knife&quot;.<br><br>So here&#39;s a list of stuff I changed:<br><br>-All of Gaston&#39;s appearances in the mission were cut. It&#39;s probably for the best, seeing as how Gaston&#39;s presence in the mission was a remnant of a subplot I ended up booting out of the final mission because I felt that it would just make the mission ludicrously long.<br><br>-Most of Annie and Xanthus&#39; subplot was cut, which included basically every scene of theirs from part six. I didn&#39;t change that much from anything up to Part 4, though. On that note...<br><br>-Part six ended up taking so many cuts in material I just appended what was the end of Part 6 to the end of Part 5, so that the mission is now seven parts and an epilogue instead of eight parts and an epilogue.<br><br>-I rewrote the entire charge confrontation with the Stu, and the confrontation is now at the level where most of the canons are rendered ineffective, the Stu&#39;s powers do crazy things, and Shepard sustains a wound that forces the agents to portal her to Medical.<br><br>-I also rewrote some of the Stu&#39;s dialogue so that it&#39;s made clear he knew about the PPC the whole time. Granted, it&#39;s mostly through inference until [what is now] Part Six, but still.<br><br>-I also rewrote most of Cindy&#39;s dialogue starting from Part 5, and took her character arc in a very different direction where she&#39;s a little more vulnerable to the Stu. Ultimately, though, in this version the Stu pushes her over the edge during the charge confrontation to the point that she casts one of the forbidden curses on him. (I couldn&#39;t touch on it at all in-mission: I&#39;ll save the ruminating on using a forbidden curse for the interlude after this.)<br><br>-I also rewrote the torture scene, where the Stu now creates a whip of ice and water and basically whips Cindy for information. (Hey, it makes about as much sense as anything else the Stu does in-story, so...) This is also where most of the reworking went with some of the Stu&#39;s dialogue, as I aimed to infer that he knew what Cindy was already and was trying to force an outcome.<br><br>-This wasn&#39;t mentioned in your feedback, but I felt it bore mentioning that I ended up cutting out chunks of the ficbits I used in Part 5, because honestly, some of the size of the ficbits I used there was kinda bothering me from the start.<br><br>So yeah. Those are most of my rewrites.<br><br>As for the length issue... I&#39;ll just assure you now that I don&#39;t think any of my missions in the near future will break the 30-page mark, so we&#39;ll see what happens.<br><br>Thanks for being honest, at least. I appreciate that.</p>

            <p><br>Chiming in to agree with what Joe said; your missions are way too long. Most people here do not have the time to read them, and that includes me. The entry level for reading your stuff is way too high. <br><br>Beyond that, I have to admit, you have another issue that makes me reluctant to read your stuff at all. In the chat, you tend to express an attitude that implies the onus is on everyone else to read your stuff, and comment, and you&#39;ve been annoyed in there on several occasions because people don&#39;t. <br><br>When people tried to point out how long your stuff was, you brushed it off, and instead of taking it as constructive criticism, you chose to say you didn&#39;t understand how everyone else&#39;s were so short, and that your missions <i>needed</i> to be as long as they were.<br><br>That&#39;s not an attitude that encourages me or others to read your stuff. Entitlement is not the name of the game; we complain about it in writers regardless of whether they write fic or original works, so it&#39;s not fair to expect that sort of treatment of ourselves here, eiher.  <br><br>Beyond that, there is a reason that missions are short; the attention span of the average reader and the fact that as a writer you can only take so much of a badfic aside. It also partially has to do with the goal of missions, as a story format in general.<br><br>Missions themselves are formulaic for a reason. They&#39;re part analysis, part wish fulfillment (Oh no! I used that dreaded phrase!).<br><br>You can&#39;t have it really be proper analysis when it&#39;s completely full up with plot. Making a mission have a heavy focus on a plot involving the agents results in the analysis either being lost, or the mission stretching out and becoming even longer than it ought be. When there&#39;s too much character progression in an individual mission, it removes the wish fulfillment portion. While agents might have their own backgrounds, personalities, and opinions, when character development and the analysis and wish fulfillment involved in a mission go at cross ends, the main purpose they serve in a mission- being our fill-ins, our window, our mouthpieces- fails.  <br><br>Most people aren&#39;t skilled at balancing the two ends evenly in a mission or try to force it into the formula that we usually use. This results in stuff being glossed over or hastily shoved in, and a mission that&#39;s ultimately subpar. The average PPC mission is &#39;set up tone and feel, go into mission, complain about how horrible the badfic elements are, try to kill or otherwise do something about it, and head back&#39;. There is not a lot of room for variety in that formula. If you want it to be plot based, or characterization based, you need to be willing to break away from it. Most people do not. Most people have not. If you want to have more focus on plot and characterization, then break away from that basic formula. <br><br>This whole problem, of course, is eliminated with nonmission pieces. It&#39;s why I do so many interludes, why VM writes cafeteria stories, why Dann writes DoSAT. The point with interludes isn&#39;t badfic or examining it, the point of those is character progression, and plot if you feel the need. Cafeteria stories and DoSAT and any of the departments that are not field based are the same. They are character and plot driven instead. <br><br>Huinesoron&#39;s Crashing Down and Reorganisation are both excellent- and long- novel length works. They both feel like very short reads, however, because they&#39;re legitimate stories, with a beginning, middle, and end, with character progression and plot. There&#39;s also the implicit knowledge that what you are reading will be resolved, and will have some sort of &#39;end&#39;. <br><br>Wih novellas and novels, as readers, we have been trained to know that things will happen, and will resolve in some manner. Length- in terms of how a story works- is of little issue here, because plots expand and close, characters develop. It has to be the right size, but that can mean anywhere from ten pages to a thousand.<br><br>That does not work with missions. They are not stories in and of themselves. The spinoff is. You have arcs, and portions that can be definitely attributed as having beginnings and ends, but that isn&#39;t the same with an individual mssion. <br><br>If you read two random missions in the same spinoff, for the most part, you are going to not be able to tell what the order is unless they explicitly reference the others. Any character development? You aren&#39;t going to be able to tell. Missions do not have that focus.<br><br>The Sue is killed, the bad slash is fixed, the locations are untangled or set fire to, and then the agents head back to unwind just enough to be able to relax to the point where the mission sound off happens at the exact worst possible time. There&#39;s no real plot there. Characters are going to remain the same, for the most part.<br><br>Missions are, at best, scenes and chapters within a spinoff. They should not have to carry a full story on their own, because they are not a full story.<br></p>

While the mission itself was very long, I actually didn&#39;t mind it at all: the degree of immersion that was achieved can&#39;t really be replicated in shorter missions. I like the idea of having a plot within a mission: it&#39;s a refreshing change from agents go in, snark, rage, charge, assassinate. It allows for character development and more interactions with the canon world. <br><br>Hats off to you, sir. <br><br>PS: There&#39;s a typo in your disclaimers, bolded by me for visibility: &quot;The PPC was <b>u</b>originally&quot;</p>

            <p>Have you ever read Neshomeh&#39;s missions? A lot of her stuff involves missions that have plots that run throughout the mission in question. I&#39;ll actually tell you now that her approach to a particularly bad World of Warcraft x Full Metal Alchemist crossover was one of the inspirations for the way I approached this mission.<br><br>Thanks!

            <p>Okay, let&#39;s get going here.<br><br>*The whole bit with the author wraith possessing the Lich King was one of the impetii behind having one of the characters get possessed by an author wraith, as a sort of fake-out in the vein of Ilraen thinking Edward Elric was a replacement.<br><br>*Splitting the agents up was another thing I got from that mission, even if I did take it in a very different direction.<br><br>*Getting an entity from the canon to help fix up the mess that the agents get in. In your case, it was a canon entity, in my case, it was an actual canon character.<br><br>That was a really great mission, BTW.</p>

            <p>Most of the stuff you mentioned, particularly the twist with the Lich King being possessed, was Phobos&#39; idea. The agents splitting up happened in part because it was in Ilraen&#39;s character to react that way, but also because if it had been just me, I would&#39;ve ended it with calling Ed a replacement and killing him. &gt;.&gt;;<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure Voltarmi was Phobos&#39; idea, too, although we probably decided mutually that going back in time was the only solution to the dilemma we created. I don&#39;t quite recall.<br><br>Anyway, we were kind of having our cake and eating it, too, the way it ended up: I got to push Ilraen and kill off Death Knight!Ed, and Phobos got to <i>not</i> kill him and pit four middling-level-at-best PCs against a sparkly pink-eyed Lich King. Fun times were had by all. ^_^<br><br>Glad you like it! I will try to read yours—I kinda feel obligated, what with you complimenting me and all—but I do have to say it&#39;s hard to sit down for 100+ pages online. I&#39;m glad to see it&#39;s broken into parts, but it may take a while before I can get through all of it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>while I do think the mission was long, it did give full feeling of why the stu was so bad some missions just skim to the extent that I have to read the fic in order to follow why half the charges are there.

            <p>&quot;Regular low end&quot; instead of average. My missions usually run in the 20-30 page range too, and typically ride high on that. I&#39;m completely all right with having missions consistently run thirty pages.</p>

Disrespecting the other fandoms they have little to no knowledge about it by including them in their crossovers, mucking it up, and breaking every rules and bending it to their own joy of seeing and reading Bella and Edward sogging each other and confessing their &quot;twu wub&quot; to each other while an intergalactic crisis is spiraling out of control. *gasping for breath*<br><br>I&#39;ll be more than happy to see this fic sporked.</p>

            <p>It occurs to me that there&#39;s a fairly serious feminist issue with this story, given that in the first chapter (the &quot;prologue&quot;) Bella complains about how the name &quot;Men in Black&quot; is sexist, and then she goes on to have a storyline hinging entirely on screwing the system to get into some guy&#39;s pants.

            <p>I assume that at least some of the Boarders are familiar with classic cartoon series such as Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry. I have a question regarding an idea for an Agent. If I were to create an Agent native to the Looney Tunes continuum, or a continuum of a similar nature, by what degree should it be toned down for it to be acceptable?<br><br>In case you are curious, the details for the Agent in question are below.

His ability to talk, and somehow play the saxophone, were what marked him as an out-and-out replacement. However, he was actually a decent character, and he, along with his future partner Riley, helped the two Agents deployed to kill the fic to hunt down the real cartoon stars. Rhodes is a generally upbeat kind of guy, and always eager to be doing something. He&#39;s also surprisingly good at he saxophone, and has a great appreciation for music. As a consequence, he gets annoyed quickly by songfics. He also reacts badly to characters being imprisoned, either literally (in an actual prison or plothole), or figuratively (by being trapped in their own minds due to the Sue throwing them OOC). As a general rule, he believes the day wasted if he hasn&#39;t bugged his partner at least once.<br><br>I will post Riley&#39;s info once I get a definitive ruling on this character.</p>

Coyote from the same Looney Tunes AU as Rhodes Runner. His status as a character replacement first came under suspicion when he had failed to use a sign to communicate even once whenever he actually had some lines to say. It was confirmed by his disregarding Rhodes Runner when, and instead focusing his attentions on the &quot;star&quot; of the story, a Replacement!Sue impersonating Lola Bunny. His character was sufficiently complex enough to warrant rescuing, and he assisted the Agents, along with Rhodes, in killing the Sue and finding the real cartoon stars. <br>He is a bit more cynical than his partner Rhodes, but is overall a decent guy. He does retain the &quot;mad scientist&quot; traits of his canon counterpart, and is an ardent believer in the notion of applying explosives to any sort of problem, no matter how trivial. He gets slightly annoyed when he&#39;s in a continuum without explosions of some variety, and seriously annoyed when he&#39;s in a fic featuring any sort of uncanonical Bad Science (Biology, Physics, etc.). He also appreciates a person&#39;s ingenuity, tenacity and perseverance, so he gets  REALLY irritated if a character disregards his dreams or goals because of a Sue&#39;s presence. Sometimes, he gets aggravated by Rhodes&#39;s antics, but usually he just takes it in stride (though not without being snarky about it).</p>

            <p>Okay, that actually sounds pretty cool.<br><br>As for how much it should be toned down, my usual rule of thumb is that while in their home continuum and in HQ, an agent is able to behave normally, as per the rules of that continuum. However while in another &#39;verse with different rules, the agents are bound to follow those rules, at least as much as possible. So if Rhodes and Riley are visiting, say, Narnia, they won&#39;t be indestructible or be able to pull giant rockets out of nowhere. However, if they were visiting Tom and Jerry or Scooby Doo, or whatever, they&#39;d have a lot more leeway with what they could do.<br><br>Of course, other people might have better suggestions for how to handle it.</p>

            <p>It varies between them, since two of my Agents are from Japanese cartoons and only one from Western, but now and then Snapshot does do things or contortions that would be impossible for a non-cartoon (I&#39;m pretty sure a real horse can&#39;t reach into its own saddlebags with its mouth, for instance, but ponies seem to be fairly capable).<br><br>Indestructability would be a bit much, but I&#39;d be fairly alright with extra resilience in pretty much any canon.

            <p>First, please allow me to remind everyone that the first person to actually write an OFU or, if an OFU is lacking, a mission in the continuum gets to name the mini. It&#39;s one of the perks of branching out.<br><br>That said, I think there are two pretty obvious choices. The first one, Indie&#39;s main antagonists, is Nazis. Of course, there are some potential issues with mini-Nazis running around, especially with names resembling the good guys&#39;, so my other choice would be Indie&#39;s biggest fear: snakes—either not-so-mini regular snakes, or mini-whatever that giant water snake was from <i>The Last Crusade</i>.<br><br>~Neshomeh + $0.02</p>

            <p>... but the only Indiana Jones mission I could find on the wiki didn&#39;t charge for mini creation.  Apparently that Suethor got the names right.<br><br>I&#39;d already crossed mini-Thuggee off the list, for the same reason you give for not using mini-Nazis.  (Besides, Temple of Doom was the weakest film in the series.)  Snakes sound good, I&#39;ll see if I can find out what breed of snake was in Last Crusade.</p>

            <p>First, there&#39;s plenty of precedent for non-miniature misspelled creatures. The Official PhanPhiction Academy of <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>, for instance, had not-so-mini scorpions and grasshoppers, after the little figurines Erik used in making Christine choose between marrying him (and saving everybody) and blowing up the entire Opera House with all of them in it. Also, <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> has Misspelled Monkeys, and <i>World of Warcraft</i> has Wrath Cadets (sort of mini-Wrathguards, but not actually miniature Wrathguards). There are probably more, but those I can think of off the top of my head.<br><br>Second, OFU gets precedence no matter what. Minis are an OFU thing that the PPC has simply borrowed, and the miniature-ness of &quot;minis&quot; is incidental to the thing in question being misspelled rather than the other way around. In other words, when it comes to the original source of the misspelled monster, size doesn&#39;t matter.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The Suethor of the &#39;Fic I&#39;ve claimed a while back created an astounding amount of minis, belonging to three &#39;verses: Doctor Who, Artemis Fowl, and Teletubbies.<br>Now, DW and Artemis Fowl have a Mini (mini-Reapers and mini-Roots, respectively), but Teletubbies doesn&#39;t, and, as far as I know, a Teletubbies OFU does not exist.

            <p>The only problem with mini-hats is that we already have them for Hogan&#39;s Heroes.  A mini-fedora might be different enough, since the HH minis are military headgear, but I&#39;m leaning toward Neshomeh&#39;s suggestion of snakes.

            <p>Well, it&#39;s the beginning of a new year, let&#39;s start it off right! Considering how we talk about badics all the time, howabout some good ones?<br><br>I got a lot of good fics to talk about, but I think one at a time should be good (unless you have a few you want to share). My recommendation:<br><br>Fic: &quot;The Pony POV Series&quot; by Alex Warlorn<br>Fandom: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic<br>Links: <a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32745467"><a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32745467">http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32745467</a></a> and <a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32848832"><a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32848832">http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32848832</a></a><br>(Oh, and there&#39;s also a TVTropes page, but be warned, it contains spoilers up the wazoo.)<br>Info: Remember early in Season 2 when Discord - for a lack of a better term - essentially mind raped everypony in Ponyville? ...Well, this fic takes it to a new level, showing the psychological effects of Discord&#39;s manipulations. Be warned, there is a LOT of Nightmare Fuel involved. The fic has multiple parts, the first is the &quot;Discorded Ponies series&quot;, about how the Mane Six fell under Discord&#39;s spell, followed by the &quot;Reharmonized Ponies series&quot;, about how the characters deal with the psychological torment they went through, even getting character development in the process, and the last one is... well, that&#39;d be  spoiling it a bit, go read this story for yourself. It&#39;s WAY better than it sounds, full of awesome, hilarious, and heartwarming moments among all the terrifying ones.<br><br>So yeah, what other fics do you people want to recommend?</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! I found a few goodfics as well. They&#39;re all in the Pit, but I assure you it&#39;s goodfic. The Pit is weird. There&#39;s a lot of dirt, rocks, and general crap, but sometimes you find some gold or a diamond. But you have to wade through a lot of crap to get to such valuables. Here&#39;s the gems I&#39;ve found in the Redwall section:<br><br><a href="http://fanfiction.net/u/2778452">Killy-s</a> in general, is, in fact great. But it&#39;s<a href="http://fanfiction.net/s/6807946/1/">Of Fur and Flame</a>, in which &quot;At the Mountain fortress of Salamandastron mother-to-be Peony Linwood anxiously awaits word from her husband Long Patrol Captain Tutsan Linwood. Meanwhile out in the woodlands an ambitious young fox longs to become a great warlord feared by all.&quot; that I&#39;m recommending.<br><br> Killy sometimes makes spelling/grammar mistakes, but they&#39;re usually quite minor, and she&#39;s very accepting of concrit.<br><br> And then there&#39;s <a href="http://fanfiction.net/u/76153/Highwing">Highwing</a>, who wrote <a href="http://fanfiction.net/s/6788438/1/">The Urthblood Saga</a>, which is actually still in progress, and currently has two novles (&quot;The Crimson Badger&quot;, the first book of which is linked above, and &quot;The Shrew War&quot;, the second novel) and a total of 11 &quot;books&quot; into which the novels are divided, as well as an origin story for his author surrogate, Highwing the sparrow, a few short stories, and a few outtakes from the first draft.<br><br> The summary for Book I on TCB is: &quot;The Badger Lord Urthblood arrives at Redwall bearing a dire prophecy, and soon the Abbey is preparing for a war like no other.&quot;<br><br> I personally have read all of what&#39;s there. It&#39;s simply the best fanfic I&#39;ve ever read. I warn you, though, it&#39;s a little darker than the original &quot;Redwall&quot; series, and there&#39;s some pretty nasty stuff that goes on and a lot of controversy, and the TSW gets loads of gruesome deaths.<br><br> And last but not least is<a href="http://fanfiction.net/u/2759192/Samadhir">Samadhir</a>, who wrote two fics of The Urthblood Saga (yeah, fanfics of fanfics), both of which are fairly good. They&#39;re called &quot;Wolfrum, an Urthblood Saga Fanfic&quot;, and &quot;Waiting For the Worms, an Urthblood Saga Fanfic&quot;. The summaries are, respectively: &quot;As the army of Urthblood prepares for their journey to Redwall Abbey, Mykola the Sword fox gets the responsibility of looking after Wolfrum, one of the &quot;problem soldiers&quot; under the badger&#39;s command. Based on &quot;The Crimson Badger&quot; by Highwing.&quot;<br><br> And: &quot;Taking place shortly after the end of Highwing&#39;s &quot;The Shrew War&quot;, this story follows two beasts, a shrew sergeant and a woodland rat, through an eventful day in the aftermath of a very important decision made by Urthblood.&quot;<br><br> I hope you find them good. Here&#39;s my recommendations from, of all places, Team Fortress 2:<br><br><a href="http://fanfiction.net/s/7288041/1/">Morbid Curiosity</a>, in which &quot;The medic dwells on his isolated past and fascination with medicine he held since childhood, and how they influenced the man he is today.&quot;<br><br><a href="http://fanfiction.net/s/7270680/1/">Purification</a>, in which the Pyro reflects on his/her/its past, and why he/she/it is the way he/she/it is. Warning: reference to rape.<br><br><a href="http://fanfiction.net/s/7235809/1/">Medic&#39;s Acid Trip</a>, in which... Well, I think you can figure it out.<br><br> And, finally, here&#39;s a nonsense (but still hilarious) crackfic from Harry Potter (fair warning, there&#39;s some bad language): <a href="http://fanfiction.net/s/2703979/1/">Napalm</a> I think you know what happens, guys.</p>

The fic&#39;s quite weird to begin with since it was supposed to have few chapters but then the author changed her mind. She made four main AU Harry Potter fanfic books, eight Dangerverse crossovers, and 21 oneshots about Dangerverse. The entire series have at least 1.6 million words and still counting since she is also making her fifth book.<br><br>You&#39;ll hate the first few chapters since there are some blatant Mary Sueish elements but they&#39;ll be gone as you continue to read the series and yes, the author is a big fan of the Grangers family.

            <p>So, this is the PPC message board. As most of you might notice, I&#39;m new here. I&#39;m a longtime fan of the PPC, and a fan of the Redwall series, LotR, Harry Potter, and The Hunger Games, to name a few. Favorite fanfics include The Urthblood Saga, the various OFUs, and others. I started out on FFnet, which can be sort of a hellhole, pardon my language. It&#39;s not always bad, but in certain fandoms you have to sift through a lot of dirt, filth, and general unpleasantness to find anything worth reading. There are some gems though.<br><br>Moving on. I came here in hopes of finally becoming an Agent, after hangin&#39; for a while. Badfic never sleeps, and neither do I, although for entirely different reasons... Redneck Trees... Raketooth... <i>never again</i>...<br><br>Moving on from that now, my favorite foods include chocolate(preferred brand is Lindt), pizza, spaghetti, and burgers. I&#39;m sort of odd, although it doesn&#39;t mean anything here, as nobody&#39;s odd when everybody&#39;s odd.<br><br>Well, here&#39;s to whatever comes!</p>

            <p>Oh my Eru, thank you! *guzzles Bleepka*<br><br> I might not be an Agent (yet... I&#39;ll be one if it&#39;s the last thing I do), but I&#39;ve seen some stuff. It&#39;s been around for a long time, and most of you have seen it too, but it&#39;s still Bad Stuff. This is what happens when you have morbid curiosity and hail from the Troll-ridden Pit. Agents Laburnum, Stormsong, Skyfire, Naomi, Drake, and a few others dealt with it originally, and they could, theoretically, attest to how bad it is. I doubt they&#39;d talk about it though. Just out of curiosity, by the way, I&#39;d like to ask something about Legendary Badfic. Even though it&#39;s been previously sporked, could a hypothetical new Agent spork it as well, even if only just for fun? Also, what are the qualifications for something to be Legendary Badfic?<br><br> Moving on to something pleasant. I&#39;d like to ask what sort of music people around here like. I know Laburnum is a huge Nine Inch Nails fan, and Jay and Acacia are Rammstien fans last I checked, but I don&#39;t know about the other Agents. My own personal favorites are mostly metal bands- Five Finger Death Punch, Avenged Sevenfold, Killswitch Engage, etc. I&#39;m also into some older metal like Iron Maiden. On top of that, I&#39;m also a fan of rock- Green Day, Paramore, Marianas Trench, and the Scorpions. And then there&#39;s classic rock- AC/DC, Aerosmith, Queen, and Twisted Sister. And I guess I like Cat Stevens a bit. I never could get into pop or rap, though. Not sure why.<br><br> I&#39;m also a musician myself. I play with the school band for my fine arts credit, but I&#39;m more of a marching musician. Always, always 120bpm is stuck in my head. And people can tell it to look at me too, I&#39;ve been told. And Merlin help people who won&#39;t iron their uniforms...<br><br> Oddly, I&#39;ve never learned to play guitar. So, what does everyone else here like to listen to?</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t get enough of Redwall. Pair of pared pares? I suppose I could coat them in the venom of a blue-ringed octopus and feed them to someone I don&#39;t like. But it&#39;s a skin-contact poison, so that would be dangerous. I guess I&#39;ll just eat them. Thanks! *tosses you a large box of Bleepolates filled with Bleepka*</p>

            <p>Hi!<br><br> Hm. Yes, the BRO, as I like to call it, has a wonderful poison. What a way to go. I like poisons. Especially Ye Olde Poisonous Poison. That stuff&#39;s fun. *mutters something incoherent in French, for no reason at all- something about sodium hydroxide, cuprous sulfate, and an annoyance at the lack of chlorine to be found in the highschool chem lab*<br><br> Other fun poisons include rattlesnake venom and, of course, everybody&#39;s staple poison, arsenic! The sad part is I have to travel to get anything cool. Cape Breton doesn&#39;t have much in the way of poisonous wildlife. 95% of everything non-plant on this island seems to be coyotes, foxes, idiots, and moose- mildly dangerous, but not venomous. Unless you count rabies as a venom. Mmmm, rabies...</p>

            <p>I personally think that the more exotic a poison is, the funner it is. BRO, taipan, Brazilian wandering spider, etc. Although there&#39;s always room for Ye Olde Poisonous Poison as well, due to the irony of Sues being killed by products of their own reality warping. *fiendish grin*</p>

            <p>That&#39;s true. I like the BWS (Brazilian Wandering Spider) as well. There&#39;s a gift it gives before your heart stops, though. But only to men. Apparently it&#39;s an amazing aphrodisiac. But it does kill you, so it&#39;s not really worth it. I also like more easily obtainable poisons like rattlesnake (only have to travel to Saskatchewan!), but Ye Olde Poisonous Poison is also good.</p>

            <p>Yup, Bleepka--although I tried to add something to flavor it more like gran marnier, it goes great in white chocolate ganache and wrapped in dark chocolate.<br><br>Ahah. Which fandoms?

            <p>Discworld? I have heard <i>so much good</i> about that fandom! I&#39;ve been meaning to start that, and Watership Down, for a while now and just never got around to it. If you like Discworld, you might like Redwall as well. I find that many Redwall fans also like Discworld and vice-versa. In fact, many fandoms are linked like that. It&#39;s rather interesting, and you&#39;ll see it a lot in the Pit. And many of those fandoms that are really crossover-compatible with one another. PJO and The Hunger Games could easily be crossed over. Katniss is actually Apollo&#39;s daughter. It fits perfectly. She&#39;s an expert archer, she&#39;s a good singer, she&#39;s badass, and a lot of really horrible things happen to her.<br><br> And Harry Potter could xover with just about anything, due to the capabilities of magic.<br><br> Moving on.<br><br> You know, I think I like it here. It&#39;s so much more fun than the Pit, at least in terms of conversation.</p>

            <p>Ahaha, considering that the Pit is a source of much of our material, I&#39;m not surprised. Certainly we try to be friendly, entertaining, and witty.<br><br>Actually, as I type this I&#39;m sitting looking at my half-a-shelf or so of Redwall. I never got too terribly much into it--I&#39;m not sure why, really, I just didn&#39;t. That said, I do love <em>Redwall</em> itself, and the world is very cute. I should probably try it again.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit that I rarely--if ever--read crossovers, although I&#39;ve seen an author cross-over U.F.O. with Superman Returns/Lois and Clark and have it go well.

            <p>Well, if through death, I&#39;d probably black out here on World One and wake up in PPC HQ. The question would be, would any wounds received on World One carry on to HQ? For instance, if I took a shotgun blast to the stomach and my &quot;soul&quot; went to HQ and formed itself a new body or something, would that new body still have a shotgun wound? I&#39;m not entirely sure of how the Laws of the Universe work on things like that, although it seems that some new guy stumbling through the cafeteria with a shotgun wound in the belly would make a really fun scene.<br><br> The option of Portal malfunction would involve a PPC Agent&#39;s portal opening up on World One and me falling through.<br><br> I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d rather do...</p>

            <p>As a matter of fact, yes, I have tasted those flavours. I usually like dark (70% or higher) chocolate, but the sea salt one is really, really good.

            <p>I know I only just arrived here a few short hours ago, but I want to ask for Permission to Write. Here&#39;s links to samples of my more recent writing, for proof that I do sort of know what I&#39;m doing: <a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/7622660/1/">The Flag</a>, and <a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/7334174/1/">Something to Live For</a>. Both are Redwall fics.<br><br>Name: Al (Alex)<br><br>Age: 17<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Home Continuum: World One<br><br>Department: Mary-Sue Dept.<br><br>Partner: Aaron<br><br>Fandoms: Redwall, The Hunger Games, Maximum Ride, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Olympians<br><br>Lust-Objects: Pasque, Katniss, Max, Luna, Annabeth<br><br>Favorites: goodfic, weapons, all things military, music<br><br>Weapons: anything he can lay his hands on- prefers knives though, as they&#39;re universal and therefore work in every continuum. He also likes guns. He <i>loves</i> guns.<br><br> Al came to the PPC one day while he was out hunting. You see, an Agent had been about to leave on a mission when his Portal decided that day was a good day to break. It opened on World One, directly under Al and the large deer he&#39;d been trying to shove into a game bag. Al fell in, deer, shotgun and all, and flew out of the Agent&#39;s Portal, bowling him over. Al&#39;s weapon went off and wounded both him and the unfortunate Agent. The Portal then sputtered out completely. The Agent dragged Al to the Medical Department, where they were promptly patched up. Al made the decision to stay at HQ instead of going back home. He was partnered with Agent Aaron- who was, coincidentally, across the hall from the Agent whose RC he&#39;d originally crashed into. He sometimes jokingly counts staying as one of the dumbest decisions he&#39;s ever made, but he really loves the job, even if it is stressful. RC number is 587-902<br>*<br>Name: Aaron<br><br>Age: 17<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Home Continuum: World One<br><br>Department: Mary-Sue Dept.<br><br>Partner: Al<br><br>Fandoms: Redwall, The Hunger Games, Maximum Ride, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, LotR<br><br>Lust-Objects: Arwen<br><br>Favorites: goodfic, weapons, food, video games<br><br>Weapons: lead pipes, sub-machine guns, switchblades, and revolvers<br><br> Aaron has a far different backstory than Al up there. Aaron was dropped through a plothole- which appeared under his toilet while he was using it. He had a rather embarrassing entry into HQ, as you can imagine. He wound up working in the Department of Mary-Sues after he found out where he was. His last partner died in the line of duty shortly before Al arrived. RC is 587-902, obviously.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m happy to hear all this encouragement. It means a lot to me. At the moment, I&#39;m expanding my areas of expertise so I can spork a greater range of badfics. The more the merrier, they say.<br><br> As to my seeming obsession with the Redneck Trees... Well, the sporkings of That Series are something that stuck with me. I&#39;m not really obsessed, although I was sort of conflicted between feeling sorry for Raketooth (what a way to go) and cheering the Burnsie on for that (because he&#39;s a pointless rapist bit-character, plus the irony). I know now that it&#39;s been forbidden as an execution method because of her. I don&#39;t know how she can wear something as a cloak when... when <i>that&#39;s</i> happened to it though. But I suppose it must still be a neat souvenir.</p>

            <p>That is... Understandable. And I really do need to tidy up Al and Aaron&#39;s profiles a bit. Guns and PPC agents don&#39;t mix, I now remember. Unless it&#39;s a railgun and Agent Drake. Or the continuum is appropriate. Maximum Ride, Death Note, and The Hunger Games would be gun-friendly. PJO might be- Annabeth&#39;s father is recorded as having used an old Sopwith Camel to wipe out an entire army, and Piper was offered a shotgun. But Redwall... Not so much. LotR would be a big no-no for guns. As much as I love firearms, I suppose the PPC isn&#39;t the place.<br><br> I will try again later though. In the meantime, I&#39;ll still be around. Posting now and then, maybe pointing out fics good or bad here, there, or everywhere.<br><br> Well, I suppose it&#39;s about time I got around to sleeping. I don&#39;t even care if I dream about Redneck Trees, I can&#39;t subsist on chocolate, coffee, and alcohol forever...</p>

            <p>Various Sues have received a blasphemy charge. It&#39;s been leveled at people who mangled various religious texts so badly that even the atheists cringed; or who created character replacements of deities (omnipotent deities cannot be out of character; they are immune) by turning the deity into a joke; or who displayed bigotry against various religions in various ways.<br><br>Religion is a difficult issue; and, in general, the PPC doesn&#39;t deal with it much because of how many different opinions people have and how you have to respect their viewpoints.<br><br>That said, though, we do deal with a lot of serious stuff that goes into fanfic; for example, agents have entered fics that contained homophobia, sexism, anti-disability prejudice, trivialization of rape, torture, and other forms of abuse and assault, and prejudice against races or cultures. Those things have been addressed with the same sort of high-quality writing I see when the issues are only grammar errors, anatomically impossible slash, or tru wuv with the resident cute guy.<br><br>Where would I draw the line? Well, there&#39;s a difference between an author writing from a viewpoint you don&#39;t agree with, and an author who&#39;s using that viewpoint to hurt others, or as a part of bad writing in general.<br><br>It&#39;s very much like the &quot;your kink is not my kink&quot; maxim for slash and erotica in general. Sure, you might get squicked by one act or another; but that&#39;s preference, and preference hasn&#39;t got anything to do with bad writing. On the other hand, if the author is doing a rape-equals-love story or turning a decent canon guy into a misogynist or just messing up the sex so badly that you&#39;re sure the act in question would be impossible even with three arms and two sets of reproductive organs... then that&#39;s spork-worthy.<br><br>Here&#39;s my suggestion for fics containing religion: If it&#39;s just an author with a viewpoint that you don&#39;t agree with, don&#39;t touch the fic. But if they are writing in a way that is obviously meant to be offensive, or shows obvious bigotry against a religious group, or makes so many mistakes that it&#39;s evident that they didn&#39;t do the research--then spork it, and show no mercy.<br><br>You know how people recommend that if you don&#39;t like slash, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be sporking it, because you have to know what good slash is to recognize bad slash? This is kind of like that, too. If there are religious issues in a fic, you should know about the religion in question; and, if you can find someone who holds that belief system, co-write with them or ask them to beta so you know you have your facts straight. While a comparative religions class can give you enough to recognize when a writer has neglected to do even basic research, all the little ins and outs and minority beliefs are generally only well-known within that religion.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we should stay away from religion just on principle, any more than we stay away from rape or child abuse or any other really heavy subject--but I do think it needs research and a good knowledge of what is bad writing or poor research, and what is merely a different belief system.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not that religion is a heavy subject and that&#39;s why we should stay away with it. It&#39;s just that things like child abuse and rape are decidedly and unquestioningly wrong. There&#39;s no other possibility here. <br><br>With religion there is no right answer. The person who wrote these religion fics believed that s/he was in the right. And they were doing what they felt was correct with their beliefs and their religion. By sending agents after them we&#39;re making a judgment call on something that can&#39;t be judged. No one is the final authority on religion. <br><br>Which is why we should stay out of it no matter HOW wrong we feel it to be. </p>

            <p>Rather than saying &quot;this is WRONG&quot;, we say &quot;this is badly written&quot;.<br><br>The Department of Bad Slash does this all the time: they train themselves to ignore their own preferences in favor of whether or not the fic is good or bad writing; and they keep in mind that when something is not their kink, they need to judge it on the basis of writing and characterization, etc.<br><br>I favor a similar approach for religious and philosophical differences--if you find an idea you disagree with, but it is presented competently, then it&#39;s not sporkable. Anybody who&#39;s ever been in a debate or philosophy class knows this: The quality of the presentation is not particularly related to the truth of the viewpoint. And it&#39;s the quality of writing we&#39;re focused on here, not the opinion itself.</p>

            <p>... that would make sense. However, we&#39;re talking about religion with fic in it, which is another animal.<br><br>If the entire point of the fic is to present the author&#39;s religious ideals, then how do you critique the presentation of those ideals without offending people who hold them? That&#39;s the issue here: it doesn&#39;t matter how unbiased and objective <i>you</i> think you&#39;re being if other people can only see that you&#39;re critiquing a story about Jesus. It&#39;s exactly the same as trying to objectively explain to a Christian that walking on water isn&#39;t physically possible—it will cut no ice with people who believe Jesus did it, and it will piss them off that you&#39;re trying to talk them out of their beliefs.<br><br>This is why we leave religion-based fics alone. Go nuts on fics that happen to have religion in them, but leave the Bible fanfic and other such expressions of faith alone.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If the fic is a vehicle for religious, philosophical, or political ideas, then that has nothing to do with whether or not it&#39;s bad writing. There&#39;s no point in critiquing that--the PPC isn&#39;t here to debate religion.<br><br>BTW: if someone told me that walking on water isn&#39;t physically possible (well, without ice or a trick of some sort), I&#39;d agree and then say Jesus did it anyway. That&#39;s why they call it a miracle. :)<br><br>I agree with Bible fanfic being off-limits, like real-person fic is; not because there&#39;s not bad writing to spork there, but because there are too many people who&#39;d insist that that meant we hated their religion. And I suppose that if the entire point of the fic were to display a religious, political or philosophical viewpoint--if the fic were not really a fic but more of an essay using the story as a vehicle for the delivery of an opinion--it would probably be risking offending somebody if we sporked it.<br><br>But staying away from religion, period, seems to be going too far. Just because something&#39;s got religion in it doesn&#39;t mean you get a free ticket to write horribly, mangle your grammar and ignore your research.</p>

            <p>I also suggest thinking about sensitive claims in a purely in-story way. The ideas aren&#39;t the problem, whether we like them or not: it&#39;s now they&#39;re expressed that is the point of interest.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter if we agree with any one viewpoint: the question really is, would the canon characters put up with it? Religion when found in a character is a trait like any other. Is it a trait used as an excuse? Or is it treated realistically, no matter what it is? Do other characters react realistically to hearing about the OC&#39;s Whateverism? Or do they blindly nod their heads and not ask questions it even if they&#39;d never have heard of it before? That&#39;s OOC just like any other case.<br><br>So really, I don&#39;t see the problem with addressing a religious head-smacker in a badfic. The point is that the religion isn&#39;t the bad thing, the USE of it is. Using religion as an excuse is just as bad as using eating disorders (I&#39;m so thin and hot because I&#39;m anorexic!), sexuality (I&#39;m gay, so my relationships are always perfect!), social oppression (I&#39;m a minority, so I&#39;m allowed to be cruel to others!), abuse (I was beaten as a child, which makes me tragic and pure!) as excuses. <br><br>I don&#39;t want to see the PPC conclude that we&#39;re not responsible enough to treat topics with maturity. The whole point of us being here is that we treat topics with maturity and good sense...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not disagreeing that we should be able to handle controversial subjects with maturity. One would hope that we can.<br><br>The point, however, is this: the Bible is a delicate subject, especially for the deeply religious, and partly <em>because</em> of the many differing viewpoints, mishandling a mission is easy to do in any number of ways. This can lead to seriously offending or outright hurting Boarders, something which is specifically mentioned (notably as regards the religious aspect) in the PPC Constitution. It isn&#39;t just about addressing a &quot;religious head-smacker in a badfic,&quot; nor how religion is used. It&#39;s about avoiding situations which have truly deep religious thoughts and consequences--like fanfic on the Bible--because of how it can affect other members of the PPC.<br><br>For reference, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Board_Constitution">item two</a> is the relevant passage.<br><br>The question of reaction to proselytizing is quite relevant to some fics, but the key there is to charge for OOC reactions to it or for having it appear in whatever the canon is (particularly if it is uncanonical; Convert!Sue in Arda comes to mind). Attacking the religiosity of it, however, is not kosher.<br><br>Also: what did you mean by &quot;using religion as an excuse&quot;? That isn&#39;t actually the point of the whole &quot;We don&#39;t touch certain kinds of fic&quot; ruling, and I actually found the implications of using it in that list quite offensive, at least without any further elaboration.</p>

            <p>Religon can be used as an unrealistic excuse-for-respect or excuse-for-power in the same way many other things can.<br><br>In my first mission, I encountered a Mary Sue that used the excuse that she was a good Christian to tell us that she was a good, morally-superior person... all while she made every other female character act like a terribly OOC, sexually-starved rabid animal (including inventing fake antagonists whose only crimes were &#39;wearing a bikini and thinking Link was cute&#39;, was nasty to Link&#39;s friends, and gave a religious speech TO THE LOCAL GODDESSES THEMSELVES, after which the local deities were SO impressed they gave her one of the local items of power. While religion is important to a person and may really BE their explanation for their morality... talking about it out of the blue to people who wouldn&#39;t know about it won&#39;t make people give you godlike powers...<br><br>Her religion isn&#39;t bad. Not in any way. But using it as a special coupon to turn in for praise and adoration in the fanfic is bad. It&#39;s as bad as using any trait to do it (I&#39;m an orphan, love me! I&#39;m an emo and that&#39;s somehow tragic, love me!), it&#39;s bad writing, and the PPC shouldn&#39;t ignore it simply because it&#39;s easier to avoid the issue than dare to even mention religion at all. Which you say in your comment, and I agree with. <br><br>Of course, if a fanfic is just going to be a recipe for disaster, there&#39;s no point sporking it. I&#39;d have a feeling of dread if I ever tried, which is not great for sporking purposes. <br><br>The PPC&#39;s job is to evaluate the writing, not the material and certainly not the author writing it, and even bigger no-no not the people reading it. I think that although some topics are controversial, we don&#39;t have to avoid them. We just have to focus on the PPC&#39;s job in that case, and just... inject our thoughts on the writing and the story like we&#39;re supposed to, and not the religion or even any other topic.</p>

Basically, this group of extremely overpowered Sues goes in, kills characters who don&#39;t believe in God, equates <i>everyone</i> who doesn&#39;t worship God with a devil worshipper, and writes his author&#39;s notes <i>so that Jesus Christ himself is applauding the author</i>.<br><br>I could barely get four chapters into the first Percy Jackson fic before I found myself wishing I had never read this fic.</p>

            <p>Judging by the TvTropes page, this thing needs to die.

            <p>Declaring that Clap Clap Jesus is a character replacement is a serious charge. While I might be using that title to refer to this rendition of Jesus, I myself might be offended depending on how someone came to this conclusion during a mission and how they decided to refer to this particular instance themselves. <br><br>As to your second portion, as Catholics we believe that Jesus Christ was born to the Virgin Mary, was the Son of God, God down from the heavens to live among men, that he gathered apostles and taught those who would follow him, was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, and arrested (on trumped up charges brought about by the Pharisees who disagree with his views and actions), tried by Pontius Pilate, and crucified on the cross. We believe he rose after three days, that the tomb he was buried in was found empty, and that he presented himself to his apostles when they were hiding in fear of retribution for being known as his followers. We believe in transubstantiation, following what he said during the Last Supper.  And so on.<br><br>These are the &#39;facts&#39; of the Catholic Church, the foundation it is built upon. When we work towards our first Holy Communion, and towards our confirmation within the church, we go over all of that. We also go over the sacraments. Being against abortion and homosexuality and so on is not on that list of &#39;facts&#39;, nor are they gone over in the prayers and teachings we learn in that time, if you&#39;ve noticed. The official stance of the Church does not mean it must be our stance as well. There are many different interpretations of various things within the Church, all at different levels. The Church is, after all, the living body of people, not the institution the people are within. All things change with time, and the various sects and views we have move into prominence or out of it. <br><br>...Anyways.<br><br>Moving on, you&#39;ve grasped the crux of the issue, here. The real issues with the fic are primarily religious ones. The ones that are not tied into that are fairly minor in comparison, even though with other stories, they are the large problems.<br><br>Your passion for CCS does not make me hopeful that you&#39;d actually not do anything. :P</p>

            <p>As you said, the problem lies with religious convictions and how a mission might make things worse. In my humble opinion, I think that this fic is extremely offensive to all who read it. It is simply too absurd to let live. My suggestion with the Creativity Shield was, in my mind, more like a compromise. Instead of going in to spork it (and potentially offend people), agents seal off the story and leave it alone. Of course, this indicates that we judge the story as something &quot;bad&quot;, so we return to the problem of political correctness.    <br><br>Guess my suggestion wasn&#39;t pertinent.

            <p>The true problem with this &quot;fic&quot; it&#39;s that we cannot even say that it&#39;s bad without offending someone.

            <p>My first sentence was on a satirical note, as a tongue-in-cheek response to the common (at least, in this part of the US) assumption that All Christians Are Catholics. There are similar assumptions (All Christians Are Baptists, All Christians Are Latter Day Saints) in other parts of the world.<br><br>But my main point was that saying &quot;Even the most rabid of [religion] would be offended!&quot; is, of itself, offensive. It implies, first off, that there is a significant portion of that religion that is &#39;rabid,&#39; which is, given the nature of humanity and communicable diseases like rabies, statistically possible, but given modern medicine, and the general awareness of how to avoid infection, not nearly as probable as you might think, especially given the common misconception that all or most nocturnal animals, such as bats... where was I going with this? <br><br>Ah, right!<br><br>Saying that people who are serious about their religion are &#39;rabid&#39; is offensive. You&#39;re comparing religious fervor with a communicable and fatal disease. This is problematic because we do try to not to be judgmental and prejudiced around here.<br><br>Hope I&#39;ve been more clear, this time &#39;round.</p>

            <p>Heya! So you&#39;re Kippur. I&#39;ve heard about you.<br><br> I actually like IC. Even if I never could get into it like I do with Redwall, Harry Potter, Death Note, and so forth, I still like it. I know, I know, stolen plot, major Gary Stus/Mary Sues, etcetera, and most PPCers don&#39;t approve in any way. I just have a few things to say.<br><br> On the subject of Sues/Stus- yes, yes they are. Arya, no doubt about it. Nasuada, kninda. Murtagh and Eragon aren&#39;t so bad- Murtagh is a bit more gray than good or bad, and Eragon would be a total Stu if he wasn&#39;t Too Dumb to Live. Roran is demi-Stu. He&#39;s super-strong, but there&#39;s a logical explanation of all that time spent doing farm work and, after that, helping in Horst&#39;s forge. It&#39;s not an excsue to kill around three hundred soldiers in one go, but still. Also, he&#39;s only slightly less thick than Eragon, still TDTL. Saphira, I&#39;m not sure about. Yes, she&#39;s infintely wise, incredibly powerful, and rather emotional, but she&#39;s also so vain and proud it makes Draco Malfoy look humble. And then there&#39;s one other character we need to bring up on that charge: Angela. She&#39;s uber-powerful, probably old beyond measure, her mind is razor-sharp, and she spends a lot of her time being unbelievably badass. But she&#39;s also amoral, bats**t crazy, and isn&#39;t exactly charismatic.<br><br> On the stolen plot: I agree completely. It follows the same basic line. Poor farmboy becomes part of a long-forgotten order of badass people of various races, goes on a journey with an old dude who teaches him stuff, gains special powers, a special weapon (he even participates in the forging of Brisingr, much as Luke made his own lightsaber), and many strong allies, and eventually brings down the big bad Empire. I don&#39;t know if Paolini did that intentionally, but it seems like it. It was almost a matter of just replacing names and terms.<br><br> Urlple Prose, I didn&#39;t actually spot much of. Certainly it was there, especially when they talked about Arya, Saphira, or many Elven or Dwarvish cities. And it was horrible. But the books aren&#39;t truly riddled with it.<br><br> And yes, the Ancient Language, Dwarvish, and Urgal are cat-on-keyboard. Although that does make them unbelievably fun to try and pronounce!<br><br> The Cycle does have some small merit, basically. The books are fairly large, and an entertaining read when you can&#39;t sleep or have a long car ride (provided you&#39;re a passenger, of course!).</p>

            <p>Nothing wrong with liking it. It&#39;s sort of a &quot;So bad it&#39;s good in some sort of weird way&quot; thing. The ideas are very good, it&#39;s just the follow through that is the biggest issue. That and the fact that Eragon consistently engages in non-heroic behavior but we&#39;re told that he is heroic. </p>

            <p>Inspired by (but not related to) the religious-badfic thread a couple down...<br><br>In the fandoms the PPC deals with there are a fair few Single Omnipotent Deities. A lot of them go by &#39;the One&#39; (not counting Neo - but including of course Eru Iluvatar), but there&#39;s also Aslan, and probably a bunch of unnamed ones. At least one of these (Aslan - probably the most interactive of the lot) knows about the PPC.<br><br>So, question: are these guys all the same being? Is there a whole skein of universes created by the same entity under slightly different names, or are there a plethora of Gods with a universe apiece? (And is Aslan part of the set? He&#39;s the creator of Narnia, but doesn&#39;t he talk about the Emperor over the Sea?).<br><br>hS, pondering</p>

            <p>My thinking is that each deity is an entity unto itself, unless there is good reason to believe otherwise. These deities may have the ability to do anything within their continuum, but are not outside of it.<br><br>I&#39;m put in mind of the Chronicles of Amber in which there is one &#39;real world&#39; of which the others are all shadows that have been distorted to varying degrees. So perhaps the gods are shadows of the Ultimate God, as filtered through the lens of the Author of each universe.<br><br>A while back, before deciding that I&#39;m not cut out to write PPC missions, I thought about creating an agent with Deity given Healing Powers and that he would have access to them only in continuums where there was a deity willing to grant them to him.</p>

            <p>I actually apply the backstory of the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> cosmology to the fictional multiverse.  It essentially says that there was originally only one World, which was only light, no darkness.  People started to get greedy, and wanted to hoard as much light to themselves as possible.  This cast a shadow in those people&#39;s hearts, and the light started to break apart.  After the light seemed completely torn up, some of it still survived in the hearts of children.  From that light, Kingdom Hearts, or God, or whatever, recreated fragments of the original World, but separate from each other.  The assumption in <i>KH</i> is that someday, all the disparate worlds will come together again recreate the greater World, but only after darkness has disappeared from every heart, and all the people of the multiverse can live together peacefully in the light.<br><br>I take Kingdom Hearts to be a metaphor for God.  So here, we have God splitting existence into many worlds, each one slightly different due to each being a different part of the original World.  Hence, they all &quot;see&quot; God, or Kingdom Hearts, as being a little different.  Narnia is filled with talking animals, so for them, He is a great speaking lion.  The Stephen King universe is full of strange creatures and occurrences, and there, He is a giant intergalactic turtle spirit.  The Pokémon world is filled with Pokémon, and its residents see Him as—well, a Pokémon.<br><br>So this was a long way of saying, &quot;I believe they are all the same being.&quot;  (Still not sure I actually swallow Arceus being God, though.  It should not be possible for God to be captured in a Pokéball and forced to fight for a ten-year-old.)</p>

            <p>&quot;Omnipotent&quot; would mean omnipotent throughout the entire multiverse; and unless all omnipotent people were in exact agreement at all times (which would make them functionally one being), there would be disagreements with one person trying to do one thing, and another doing another; and how do you pit one omnipotent deity against another? They both, by definition, can do anything.<br><br>So, yeah, they would have to be all the same, because the multiverse is connected; or else they could not be omnipotent. They could be able to influence everything within their own continuum, but that wouldn&#39;t be &quot;omnipotent&quot;, only very powerful.<br><br>Thankfully, there are very few of them, and they are all alternate-universe representations of the God of the Bible, from either the Christian, Jewish, or occasionally Muslim viewpoint; so their authors likely thought they were the same thing too.<br><br>So, yeah, they&#39;re all the same thing. Otherwise you run into logical contradictions. As for different writers giving their versions of God different personalities, different opinions, etc.: Two possibilities. Either the Authors are seeing the same person from many perspectives, so there aren&#39;t any contradictions; or else the logical contradictions exist, God is different in different continua, and it&#39;s better not to think too hard about it, much the way one shouldn&#39;t think too hard about the mechanism by which Bleeprin erases badfic headaches. The PPC runs on plot holes--this would be just one more to add to the collection.</p>

            <p>&quot;Omnipotent&quot; could conceivably just mean all-powerful over us. To us, a god is all-powerful in the same way we humans are all-powerful over ants: there is nothing within their limited scope we cannot do; there is nothing within our limited scope that a god cannot do.

            <p>I&#39;m personally a fan of (though not an adherent to) the theology in <i>Young Wizards</i>, so there&#39;s the One, who made everything, and then there are the Powers That Be, who helped (or didn&#39;t, in the case of the Lone Power) and actually run around doing things and interacting with people when necessary. The Powers That Be are finite in number, but they exist outside of time and have infinite capacity to create avatars of themselves in the world(s). Thus, from just one of the PTBs we have the One&#39;s Champion, Michael the Archangel, Prometheus, Athena, Lugh, etc. And a pet parrot, which just goes to show that an avatar can be whatever the PTB needs it to be, not necessarily a god-like being. Each avatar is separate and autonomous, even though they&#39;re all technically the same being.<br><br>I figure, this easily extends to other continua. The One is the One, but any potent personalities that actually get involved in-universe (Aslan, the Valar, etc.) could be avatars of the various PTBs. So, yes, some of them are the same being—but then again, some aren&#39;t, and either way it doesn&#39;t matter, because they aren&#39;t just puppets, they are unique fully-functional incarnations imbued with some of the Power in question&#39;s essence.<br><br>That being the case, you bet they know about the PPC, but it&#39;s pretty much Multiversal that the local deities/PTBs usually don&#39;t get involved with the affairs of mortals unless it&#39;s absolutely vital. So there you go. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The trinitarian allegory with Aslan and the Emperor could be done without three-- since the Holy Ghost is on Earth to minister to humanity while the Father and Son are not, it would be different in Narnia; for most of the series, Aslan is either physically present or on the cusp of arrival. <br><br>(Oh ye gods and little fishies, the Space Trilogy. So much love/hate. The best part of that series is either the bit at the end of <i>Perelandra</i>, &quot;Have no fear, lest your shoulders be bearing this world. Look! It is beneath your head, and carries you.&quot; Or possibly his point that despising creatures simply for being the shape that they are is absurd. He&#39;s got so much very excellent, very interesting theology there! And then he sandwiches it with... the rest of the text.)<br><br>As per your original question, I do think it makes more sense to say that each universe is handled by their own deity or demigod-- because there&#39;s just bits and pieces where they don&#39;t add up. To get unforgivably and unhumorously theological on  you, I&#39;d say humans trying to write allegories of God can be likened to people trying to construct a mirror-perfect representation of an image, but all of us from different angles, with different tools, in whatever light in which we&#39;ve perceived the original. All of them have some merit, all of them are faithful to the author&#39;s intent (more or less), but none  of them <i>are</i> the original.<br><br>In a more practical-for-purposes-at-hand sense, that would simplify things a great deal for Agents from a monotheistic world. How do you go from Eru/Ilùvatar to Aslan/Emperor to the version of YHWH in World One-base series? And any Agent with a fervent view would probably be contending that <i>their</i> deity was in charge of the multiverse, and the rest were demigods/false/etc.<br><br>But from an author&#39;s perspective, I have to say it makes more <i>sense</i> for them all to be single-&#39;verse deities; of course, that&#39;s just what, as pointed out above, a character would say.<br><br>...On further consideration, I think Dann is right, and it&#39;s far too late in this time zone to keep up with this thread.</p>

            <p>Considering agents can be from anywhere in the multiverse, from any text and non-text medium, I wouldn&#39;t say having a home is very important. And even when an agent does have a &#39;home&#39; it can be sort of arbitrary. An agent that hails from Middle Earth may be very different from one lifted out of a badfic set in middle earth. An agent from a Middle-Earth-set romance fic may even be very different from an agent that hails from a Middle-Earth-set action/adventure fic.<br><br>Agents can be from unpublished works, original fiction... ANYTHING could be out there, so anything goes, really. As long as it&#39;s enjoyable and well-balanced.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see it as being that important to have a home continuum.  What is important is that there is a consistent set of rules that govern your character.  Who knows, maybe the search for their home continuum could be a major plot line for that character.</p>

            <p>1) How do you refer to a dummy possesed by a second-person Mary-Sue OC? Do you simply say &quot;the dummy&quot; until the Sue has been named?<br><br>2) What are minis in the Doctor Who continuum called? I apologize for not looking in the Wiki, the organization method confuses my brain.<br><br>3) Do the actors&#39; names misspelled count as minis, even though they are not technically part of the canon or badfic plotline?</p>

<li>&quot;The dummy&quot; works, or &quot;the Sue,&quot; or &quot;it,&quot; or whatever other pronouns apply, or whatever else you can think of to distinguish it from the other characters. Kinda like anything else.<br><br>2. They are mini-Reapers. (What those are and why not Daleks I have no idea, but there it is.)<br><br>About the wiki, I&#39;m curious about what you find confusing. I&#39;ll be the first to admit the organization could be improved in places, but specifics would be useful.<br><br>That said, though, there <i>is</i> a search bar, and putting in &quot;Mini&quot; gets you a page that lists all the ones we&#39;ve defined in alphabetical order by continuum, so... yeah.<br><br>3. I... don&#39;t actually know. I know you get a mini by misspelling the author&#39;s name, though those minis aren&#39;t adoptable, so I guess that could apply to actors as well. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s come up before, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>As I recall (and I wasn&#39;t involved, I don&#39;t think) the reason it&#39;s Reapers rather than something like Daleks is... probably twofold. First, Daleks are intelligent, which most mini&#39;d species aren&#39;t, noticably. Second, they&#39;re often lesser monsters - Balrogs, not orcs; Aragogs, not basilisks or, er, Voldemorts; Rancors, not Sarlaacs or, well, Sith. Oh, and third, I think Father&#39;s Day had just come out ;).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So I wrote a Lord of the Rings fic last month and posted it on the Pit. While I&#39;ve had a couple of reviews, I was reading it over just now and realised I never asked the people I trust (given as you guys are the ones who made me appreciate that mindless praise isn&#39;t concrit) for their opinions on it.<br><br>So, I guess this is a request for some concrit.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7636021/1/Homecoming"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7636021/1/Homecoming">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7636021/1/Homecoming</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s more or less a reflective piece from Galadriel&#39;s point of view. For someone who&#39;s been in the PPC so long, I sure have taken my time dipping my toes into actual fanfic writing... :P</p>

            <p>I am currently investigating a Starcraft / Mass Effect fic that seems to have  a horribly skewed power scale in favour of the ME side: I am about 70% sure that every single thing that Shepard&#39;s team does is seriously OP in the Starcraft &#39;verse. The ME wiki can only tell me so much about the tech, characters, and lore so can somebody who knows this verse have a quick look-over to confirm my suspicions?

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Okay... So I took a look at the first five chapters of this thing. Here are my impressions:<br><br>Well, the ICness of the characters tends to vary a bit. Miranda and Jacob were fairly OOC when they were first introduced (Miranda doesn&#39;t really harp on her &#39;second in command&#39; status that much in the games, and Jacob isn&#39;t really the kind to be confrontational), and some other lines make no sense (Garrus and Mordin have a couple lines that don&#39;t agree with their characterizations.) But on the other hand, this is the most IC I&#39;ve ever seen the Illusive Man in badfic, and the writer has Mordin&#39;s speech patterns down pat. So it&#39;s not totally in character all the time, but it&#39;s not the most OOC I&#39;ve ever seen people get in this continuum.<br><br>I question the logic of a second omni-tool manifesting on someone&#39;s wrist, though. That isn&#39;t plausible, since omni-tools need a free hand to manipulate, and I&#39;m pretty sure that the omni-tool also has to have something physical there, I don&#39;t remember what. It&#39;s not just a holographic interface, so... I&#39;d chalk that bit up to Rule of Cool abuse, since it&#39;s there to allow Shepard a second omni-blade (which <i>will</i> be a canon weapon come ME3, so...). That bit doesn&#39;t work.<br><br>I&#39;d also question the Normandy&#39;s ability to repel a Yamato cannon. If you upgraded the Normandy&#39;s armor and shields in-game (which I&#39;m assuming this fic did because they make mention of some of the other ME2 ship upgrades), it&#39;s true that you can throw a very high-powered particle beam at it and still be safe. At the same time, though, the Normandy is only a frigate, and it was designed for stealth and excellent maneuverability, not for direct dogfighting. As I don&#39;t know how Starcraft tech goes, I&#39;d have to know how a Yamato cannon actually works in order to accurately assess how easily the Normandy could withstand it. It is feasable for the Thanix Cannon to tear right through an enemy ship, though, as that particular cannon manages to take down a Collector cruiser in two shots in-canon. Seeing as how the Collector cruiser in question was a ship that was both larger than the Normandy and had superior technology, it&#39;s not too much of a stretch to assume that it could do some serious damage to ships of another continuum.<br><br>I&#39;m not totally sure about how fast the Normandy takes down all the ships, though. Even for the Normandy, it looks like they take down a huge amount of ships in a ludicrously small amount of time. That might be a function of the prose itself, though, because that bit was very rushed.<br><br>There&#39;s a big issue you probably wouldn&#39;t think of that came to my mind while reading this, though. See, in ME canon, not all the aliens speak English. This is handwaved by the fact that these little things called &quot;translators&quot; exist that allow you to understand any alien language since they translate it for you. Crossovers tackle translators in different ways, but I think the most accurate depiction is to not have &#39;em if the other continuum doesn&#39;t have it. Again, seeing as how I don&#39;t know Starcraft all that well, I&#39;d have to know for certain if the Starcraft continuum has translators. If it does, then I can possibly see why the aliens would be instantly understood. If not, that could possibly be a pretty big charge.<br><br>Hm... I know that the biotic barrier that Jack summons can block smaller objects from entering. But if said object is travelling at a high velocity, that makes me less sure because the biotic barrier they&#39;re talking about can&#39;t block mass accelerator rounds from either side, in both gameplay and cutscenes. Thus, I think it would be too much of a stretch to assume that Starcraft bullets can just bounce off the thing, so that bit at least is fairly implausible.<br><br>I know that Grunt would DEFINITELY be able to charge guys while taking a ton of punishment, but I don&#39;t think people would fail to notice him charging, given that krogan are <i>huge</i> in comparison to humans and that the aliens are probably stealing all the attention in this situation.<br><br>The whole bit about the ME-verse technology being based on Xel&#39;Naga technology is actually <i>really</i> canon breaking for the ME-continuum, though. The thing is this: the Protheans inherited the mass relays, rather than making them. So did the species before the Protheans, and the guys before them, and vice versa. See, the technology of the ME universe is based on the technology of the Reapers that go in and destroy all organic life every 50,000 years, and it&#39;s been like that basically since the beginning of the universe. It plays into their Xanatos Gambit in rather large ways, which I won&#39;t go into here. The fact that all species are essentially unwittingly playing into the Reapers&#39; plans by developing a technology along their path is thus a piece of the Reapers that plays as a pretty big plot point throughout the first Mass Effect. As Sovereign says in the first game, &quot;We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it.&quot; Thus, having ME-tech be suddenly based on Xel&#39;Naga technology creates a <i>massive</i> plot canyon in the ME continuum. <i>That</i> is definitely implausible, and if this were ever to be sporked, then this would constitute a canon break in the ME continuum. I&#39;m sure it would also create a canon break in the Starcraft continuum as well, given the nature of Prothean technology as I&#39;ve explained above.<br><br>Reaper indoctrination not working in the Starcraft continuum is also very implausible. If the experiences we&#39;ve had with indoctrination throughout the entire ME franchise say anything right now, <i>nobody</i> can escape indoctrination, especially since you don&#39;t know that you&#39;re being indoctrinated when you get indoctrinated.<br><br>So overall, my impression is that this fic is pretty canon-breaking for the ME continuum, but not in the way you&#39;d expect. It&#39;s possible for the Normandy to do some of the things it does in-fic, but my bigger concern is in the stuff that attempts to bring the Starcraft and ME universes together, because it makes no sense at all and breaks canon for both continua. Honestly, part of me is wondering if this author ever played the first game, so yeah.<br><br>I&#39;ll have to look through the rest of this thing at a later time, but for now, those are my impressions.</p>

            <p>Error at the beginning of the first chapter: the zerg do not possess better tech than what ME has. In fact, the zerg have no use for technology, their interactions with other species limited to: a) kill it now  b) kill it later  c) assimilate into the Swarm. <br><br>On your question about the Yamato: it is a gigantic ship-based weapon that fires a shaped nuclear explosion at a target. In game, it is a one-hit kill on nearly every single unit in the game except for massive units, Archons, Ultralisks, buildings, and certain Protoss starships. I don&#39;t think the Normandy can survive being shot by a massive ball of plasma. <br><br>For that matter, Terran Battlecruisers are essentially gigantic damage sponges, capable of taking heavy beatings (capable surviving a Yamato blasts themselves) and possessing energy-based shields in addition to heavy plating. Their armament consists entirely of laser weaponry, which I&#39;m certain the Normandy will have a hard time guarding against. Battlecruisers are some of the most deadly air units in the game, and in canon act as capital ships for Terran commanders. </p>

            <p>... I wasn&#39;t finished yet.<br><br>Language wise, I assume that all Terrans speak English. Protoss thought-speech is translated automatically to any listeners. Zerg receive orders from the Overmind / Queen of blades / other superiors through a dedicated telepathic channel and are otherwise not sentient. <br><br>Inappropriate use of Banshee aircraft: it&#39;s like throwing a helicopter into space. Stupid and useless.<br><br>If you say that accelerator rounds can pass through a biotic barrier, then the Normandy crew would have been shot to bits in less than ten seconds. Yes, the C-14 Impaler rifle is gauss-powered, but it is by no means inferior to ME tech. It fires 8mm steel, 50 cal, or U-238 spikes at hypersonic velocities at 30 rounds per second. Its magazine holds over 200 rounds and the rifle can empty it with a full, non-stop burst without overheating. <br>When Horner called for Stim-packs, he was referring to a stimulant that can be injected into infantrymen that doubles their speed and reaction times, meaning that Marines can move and shoot twice as fast. Infantry can deal <s>terrible terrible</s> heavy damage in-game when Stims are used properly, so I dread to think what it could do to targets behind a shoot-through biotic barrier.  <br>Grunt couldn&#39;t have brushed off the Marines between him and Horner so easily: they must weigh well over a metric tonne in that suit.<br><br>Also, I just noticed the author just handwaved away Protoss tech: &quot;Protoss shields falter by gauss technology, and by the weapons being slightly weaker, well then here you go.&quot;<br>That&#39;s like saying a wall is weak because a guy with a sledgehammer can break through. <br>The author seriously underestimates Protoss power: their weapons are all psionic or energy based. To give you an idea of the sheer power that the Protoss wield, think of this: their most basic infantry unit, the zealot, has a powered armoursuit that has a ton of shields packed onto it, a teleportation device that spirits the wounded soldier away, and is equipped with a 3/4 metre-long blade made out of his own mind-energy. Yeah. Because the author said that psionics cannot affect the ME universe, he/she has just made the ME crew invulnerable to most &#39;Toss attacks. What.<br><br>Also, Zerg/&#39;Toss non-organic interface saved by DNA uplink?  Non-organic and DNA cannot coexist in the same thing. Also, as stated in my previous post, zerg have no need for tech, so why is it there?<br><br>I also like how the author managed to paste Shepherd&#39;s crew into canon cutscenes. It&#39;s really, really funny.</p>

            <p>Yeah.<br><br>Granted, most mass accelerator rounds are actually smaller than 8mm, and since mass accelerator rounds use mass effect fields to speed them up beyond other physical means (to the point that a paint chip could be just as lethal as a nuclear weapon at sufficient velocity), well, that could handwave that. But given that hypersonic speeds are also being fired from the Starcraft variation of gaussian tech, I&#39;m not sure that we&#39;d be in business there... <br><br>And then there&#39;s the whole fact that the Terrans can perfectly understand what the aliens are saying if the Zerg don&#39;t speak and the Protoss automatically translate. If that&#39;s true, then the Terrans shouldn&#39;t be able to understand any of the aliens there. The fact that not all species speak the same language in the ME-verse is actually a minor plot point in the Thane romance, since the only reason &#39;siha&#39; comes through as Thane&#39;s term of endearment for Shepard is because Shepard&#39;s translator glitches out on the term and is unable to translate it effectively. Also, you&#39;ll hear various quarian phrases filter through the translators at times, and there&#39;s supposedly a point in the first game&#39;s Bring Down The Sky DLC where the batarians are supposedly speaking in their own language to each other. This kind of instant translation for people without ME-verse translators is actually a very common error that&#39;s made in most crossover fanfiction with the ME-verse, but it&#39;s worse with fics like this that involve other sci-fi continua with sprawling alien stuffs.<br><br>As for everything else...<br><br>...Yeah, all this sounds bad enough that I think it could-- and should-- be taken to the sporking block. If the author handwaved the technology of an <i>entire species</i>, then there&#39;s something wrong with this story entirely. I mean, this author is committing <i>tons</i> of crimes against the tech of both continua, even going so far as to completely break canon with the whole Xel&#39;Naga being behind ME-verse tech bit.<br><br>And you know, the crazy thing is that this author actually does the <i>reverse</i> of what a lot of other Mass Effect crossovers with another sci-fi continua tend to do: in most crossovers of this nature, it&#39;s actually the ME-verse that has the inferior technology. So I&#39;m half beginning to think that this is a stealth parody of that tendency in ME crossover fiction.</p>

            <p>I loved that gag. It was one of my favorite parts of The Emperor&#39;s New Groove. <br><br>I don&#39;t know the Dragon Age canon at all, but that Sue was patently awful.
