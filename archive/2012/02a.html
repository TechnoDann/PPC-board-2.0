            <p>Thanks for the comments Guv, I&#39;ve gone through and taken a look at the bits you mentioned.  Out of interest is there a reason you would have used Live and Let Die rather than Goldfinger?</p>

            <p>These pieces were both very enjoyable!  I like the mixture of mission and PPC-goings on that you have happening here.  You did some creative things in the mission that set it apart, and I also like the setup of strangeness happening in RC 4095.  It has me intrigued!  I wonder if the SO assigned them there so that any further incidents don&#39;t go unreported?<br><br>However, I also have to say that you need to work on your commas and apostrophes.  As much as I enjoyed these stories, every time I hit a possessive with no apostrophe, it through right out of my train of thought.  There were also quite a few misspelled words in the first one, such as &quot;eventual looser&quot; instead of &quot;loser.&quot;  I strongly suggest reading through them again with an eye for spelling and punctuation.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s crazy to see that the Avengers movie is getting incredibly bad canon-breakers like this before the movie is even <i>out</i>. What the heck is up with that?<br><br>Anyway, this was a really fun mission. It was great to see the theory they came up with for finding the Sue without an RA. I also really liked how it took a non-standard format for the mission, and especially seeing the stuff the fic did to the continuum.<br><br>The canon split was really weird, but I&#39;d love to see more of that.<br><br>So in other words, it&#39;s great that you&#39;re back to writing missions! :D</p>

            <p>Thanks for the comments.  To be fair there were just so much in there that seemed to break the canon.  The Sue&#39;s existence,  Pepper Potts dying years before the Iron Man films, despite it claiming to be set inside of canon, and so much more.  I felt the canon needed to do a little fighting back.<br><br>Hopefully they won&#39;t need to worry about not having an RA now that they&#39;ve made it to full agent status, but who knows there may be more creative results needed.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I found this mission a bit hard to follow.  It was structured well, but I am unfamiliar with <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</i>.  I didn&#39;t understand what gems and cores are/do, or how the magic system in this universe works, or even the plot, really.  There seems to be some kind of war going on, with cadets being trained, and occupied vs. unoccupied planets, but I don&#39;t know the causes of that war, or how this story fits into that context.  It&#39;s good to explain less well-known canons to your audience (us) so we understand why the badfic is a danger to it.  Details about canon characters are important, too; you said that Fate was a &quot;White Devil&quot;, which had me picturing an egg-colored version of the Red Guy from <i>Cow and Chicken</i>.  I didn&#39;t realize Fate was female until one of the badfic quotes referred to her with a female pronoun.<br><br>That said, you did well to include passages that anyone could recognize as bad writing, like the cute animal summons and Fury&#39;s inappropriate behavior in a military setting.  These are things PPCers will be familiar with, and really showed off the general Suishness of the OCs.  I also liked the setup for the assassination scene.  You gave enough details to get across the feeling of impending disaster without bogging down the flow with extra info that wouldn&#39;t be needed that late in the story.<br><br>One weird thing I wanted to mention.  It seems that &quot;Nature&quot; isn&#39;t a legitimate element in <i>MGLN</i>, so I assume Might of Oaks isn&#39;t a canon spell.  In that case, it&#39;s probably a ripoff/homage of this <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> card:<br><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191316"><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191316">http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191316</a></a><br>So if you feel like it, you could add &quot;using a spell from another canon&quot; to Hana&#39;s charge list.  :)</p>

            <p>Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Nanoha isn&#39;t very popular, so I suppose I should&#39;ve expected this. The Time-Space Administration Bureau is rather like an interdimensional police force. However, they  won&#39;t go conquering worlds, so there&#39;s Unadministrated Worlds, (like ours) where the TSAB doesn&#39;t (usually) go. The cadets are being trained to join the Bureau, and there&#39;s no war going on. The basic plot of the season the fic takes place in is: Evil Doctor and his 12 cyborg &#39;daughters&#39; want to conquer the world with an ancient artifact, the main characters form a special section to deal with him. <br>Nanoha, not Fate, has been nicknamed the White Devil, because of her tendency to make new friends with mecha-class beam cannons, and for a line from the second season:<br>*Nanoha walks out of a fire*<br>Character: You...devil<br>Nanoha: Call me a devil... (pulls out weapon.) It just means I&#39;ll have to use my hellish tools to get you to listen!<br>(please pardon my fangirling, that&#39;s one of my favorite scenes)<br>The gem thing: Weapons in the nanoha-verse (Intelligent Devices) can take a standby mode--after all, walking around with a laser gun or an energy scythe in public is kinda terrorist-y. The standby mode can take many forms, and is often a gemstone-looking object. However, it&#39;s impossible to turn a normal jewel into a Device, since they will need a lot of hardware. The cores thing...is never mentioned in canon.<br><br>No, Nature is not an element. The Mana Conversion Affinity (almost never referred to by name)is the ability to turn magic into a certain other energy, but it&#39;s usually something chemical-reaction-y. The character Signum has a fire Affinity, and Fate has a lightning one. I didn&#39;t know that Might of Oaks was a card, I&#39;ll add it.</p>

            <p>Okay, so I have a few items I need to get to first before I say anything else:<br><br>1) When you post a mission, it&#39;s usually customary to post that mission to the front page of the wiki, in addition to everywhere else you&#39;d post it there. Just for future reference.<br>2) Also for future reference, it&#39;s generally a good idea to take out all the comments your betas left for you before posting the mission. If we see the development, it can get kinda distracting.<br>3) In the posting of the mission, it&#39;s also standard practice to post a list of the minis and the loot that you got from the mission.<br><br>Okay. Now that I have those small issues out of the way, let&#39;s get to your mission.<br><br>Your first mission isn&#39;t that bad. That said, though, there are a few issues. For one, I felt there was an exorbitant amount of ficbit thoughout this whole thing, such that it actually really slowed down the pacing after a certain point. I&#39;d suggest using much less ficbit than you have here.<br><br>Also, I felt a little out of the loop. This is probably because I don&#39;t know <i>Magical Girl Nanoha</i> and thus don&#39;t know what&#39;s overpowered and what&#39;s not overpowered, and who all those factions are. I&#39;m not asking for As You Know, but it would help to establish that kind of thing for those of us that don&#39;t know that continuum all that well.<br><br>That said, though, there were still plenty of good moments. I think Ari and Tera both have a good rapport going for them, and when you do describe the crazy thing the fic does to the World, it&#39;s actually quite witty.<br><br>But to be completely fair, I felt the mission read a bit too much like an MST to really work effectively.</p>

            <p>Posting a list of minis and loot is not standard practice.  In fact, it is a fairly recent trend, which not everyone follows, myself and Nesh included (as evidenced by our last mission post).  Not saying you shouldn&#39;t or can&#39;t, if you feel like it.

            <p>Why did the chat move? I suppose it&#39;s generally not my business, but it just up and moved with no Board announcement or explanation. Just a note that it had moved.

            <p>Ain&#39;t nobody in this community, &#39;Board or IRC, that doesn&#39;t have a right to know what and when things are happening, and why. The reason that I heard was that doppleganger troll, the one who was signing in with Data&#39;s name (and on here, presumably the same person, Aster&#39;s). The new server (irc.sorcery.net) should fix that by way of being more strict with registered nicks.<br><br>The channel name, #PPC, is the same, and I think there&#39;s a note on the topic of the old channel on Blitzed; the new one is just on irc.sorcery.net instead of irc.blitzed.org.<br><br>Hope that helps, very sorry for confusion.</p>

            <p>I love the dialogue you made for Frag and Norion, especially the part where Norion threatens Danny and no one takes her seriously.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m biased towards Danny&#39;s story because of their cameos, but both of the interludes were <i>quite</i> enjoyable. Laura seems like a very fun character to write, albeit not a fun one to get in the way of.</p>

            <p>Personally I really enjoyed the whole thing, although I think Danny&#39;s interlude interested me more than Laura/Rachel.<br><br>Really love the idea of the club, and hope you&#39;ll get the chance to explore it more in the future, as well as seeing it in some other stories too.</p>

            <p>... Would cover the short version of my response, but for the sake of me trying to write some-what more in-depth opinions, I&#39;ll use a few more words.<br><br>I liked the description for the Pennacook Club. My mental image was of the exclusive hunting club in The Beast Within, A Gabriel Knight Mystery. That said, I do agree with Phobos, that a little more info on who else might be in it would have been nice. After all, in an asari, a krogan, and a troll can be in it, I&#39;m sure ti has plenty of interesting and upscale (as the PPC can be) individuals. <br><br>I really liked that one of the Flowers showed up. Unexpected, fun, and gives them some more depth then just being the nasty bosses. The idea of her sitting in a blub with the others, sipping some fancy drink and rolling dice is a very fun mental image.<br><br>Laura. Laura, Laura, Laura. Very funny, and certainly TF2 Soldierish. She is the best kind of teacher, one who will be the hardass driving force, but also someone you can blow things up in glee with. Rachel is as excitable and fun as ever (and also showing some good knowledge). <br><br>All in all, it was well worth the time to read it. Good job!<br><br>(Also, in response to Phobos, I know a couple of pen and paper RPGs that have plenty of class(es))  :P</p>

            <p>First off, let me just say that I am very behind in my PPC related reading.  As such, this is the first I&#39;ve read of Danny, Laura, and Rachel.  That being said, I think these two short stories were excellent introductions for the three of them.<br><br>Let&#39;s first look at Danny&#39;s story...since it is first.<br><br>I liked the thought that you put into the bars in HQ.  While I am not convinced that we need that many bars, I still appreciate the way you gave each one a personality.  I&#39;ve been to a number of bars in my day, and each one is different.  So, spot on with that.<br><br>I would have liked more information about this club they are a part of.  Who runs it?  What else was going on in the room?  Was anyone else even there?  You had some nice details, but the bigger picture would have been nice, as well.<br><br>You managed to give pencil-and-paper RPGs a bit of class, well done.  I liked the in-game scenes with their Superhero characters.  Was that a specific system, or just something you made up?<br><br>All of the interactions were well done.  I got a real sense of the group dynamic.<br><br>The best part of Danny&#39;s section, for me, was the arrival of the Rose of Sharon.  It had not even occurred to me at that point that a Flower would be involved in something like this.  So, well done for surprising me.<br><br>Overall, I quite enjoyed Danny&#39;s section.  It appealed to my inner nerd, as well as to my outer nerd.<br><br><br>On to Laura and Rachel&#39;s section.<br><br>The set up of this section was a lot of fun.  Reminded me of Meet the Soldier from TF2.  You did an excellent job of making Laura&#39;s seriousness funny.<br><br>Laura makes a good point about the brain being the most important weapon.  If you have nothing else, at least you have your brain.  Sometimes, that just has to be enough.<br><br>The Wii-mote bit was quite well done.  You had a lot of tension and energy going and you were really clipping along, and the the whole thing kind of dissolves into silliness.  It was an excellent use of tone shift.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t really find anything wrong with this one.  It was a very strong piece.  The interactions were solid, the characters were fun, and the tone was spot on.<br><br>Well done, all around.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the detailed review! I find that the more specific reviewers are, the more I can refine my next piece.<br><br>I admit that I was a bit torn on how much to put in about the club. I didn&#39;t want to bog down the story with a few paragraphs of description and exposition. Upon reading the section again, I realize that I could&#39;ve gone a little bit further with some details and backstory. Fortunately, I do plan on revisiting the Pennecook Club some time in the future, so I will have another chance to flesh the place out.<br><br>The RPG that they&#39;re playing is a real game. It&#39;s called Mutants and Masterminds, and it&#39;s one of my favorites. The version that Danny&#39;s using has a few alterations/home rules (M&amp;M vanilla doesn&#39;t have critical failure results, for example.)<br><br>Laura is definitely channeling the TF2 Soldier. I thought about having her quote Sun Tzu (or some derivation thereof) when I started, but I changed my mind later on in the writing process.<br><br>Again, thank you for the feedback!</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t imagine you <i>ever</i> asking for concrit, chiefly because I really don&#39;t think you need it. I mean, for cryin&#39; out loud, you wrote the Sandwich!Stu mission! It doesn&#39;t get much funnier than that.<br><br>These are a good pair of interludes. I think I preferred the Laura and Rachel half of the story, since that had a lot more energy to it than the other one. For Danny&#39;s interlude, I thought they were planning on doing an Ocean&#39;s 11 kind of thing before I realized they were playing a weird sci-fi variation of D&amp;D. That may not necessarily be a bad thing, though, because that lent itself to some nice energy.<br><br>And the rapport between the characters? Always nice.<br><br>Just out of curiosity: did you co-write Fang and Norion with Firebird?</p>

            <p>Ah, flattery. Thank you for taking the time to stroke my ego. ; )<br><br>Firebird was kind enough to offer me detailed character write-ups. Just about all of the little details - Frag and Norion&#39;s clothing, behavioral tics, and so on - came from those biographies. The only major thing I provided was the specific dialogue.</p>

            <p>Everyone can always use concrit.  No matter how good their writing is, it can always be better.  Concrit lets us know what doesn&#39;t work, so we can fix it.  It also lets us know what does work, and why, which allows us to use it more effectively in the future.<br><br>Concrit is <u>never</u> unnecessary.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Dear sweet Celestia. I read Molestia in its entirety, but not the other two. Yeah, rabbit and elil*? No. Not safe for brain. About as safe for the brain as a hammer to the head. I figure the Dogs might be a little too large for that anyhow. Who in the Nine Hells writes that for a friend?<br><br> Mmm, KFP. I wouldn&#39;t eat that, as hilarious as the idea would have sounded a couple of months ago. Now it just horrifies me. I see some massive OOC going on there just looking at the summary.<br><br> And last but not least, a few of my own comments on Molestia (which now has a sequel- Lunaughty, I kid you not). It was insanity. In a sick, twisted, inexplicable way, it actually had a viable plot- a monster locked away in an otherwise wonderful pony. And then the author took this in completely the wrong direction and tried to make it a clopfic. I died on the inside reading it. Parts of my brain I didn&#39;t even know I had started to hurt. My frontal lobe just shut down for a while to cope. At least it&#39;s not riddled with bad grammar and Sues like My Immortal. If you really want to think about it, Celestia is only half-replaced. During the moments when she is not her alternate self, she&#39;s fairly in character, as are most of the other ponies.<br><br> And I have to give them credit, the times they tried for &quot;funny&quot;, they got it well, considering the situation. Now I&#39;m finished playing Devil&#39;s Advocate though. More railing now.<br><br> Why, just why? What the Hellsgates gave them this idea? This should never have happened. It&#39;s no Cupcakes or SAM, but it&#39;s nasty.<br><br>* I&#39;m about a quarter of the way through Watership Down. Brohoof, other reader!</p>

            <p>Molestia and Lunanaughty are both ask blogs on Tumblr. Princess Molestia, done by the artist JJ, is more comic-style, while Lunanaughty, by Skoon, is more of the typical &quot;question with a picture and some text answering it&quot; style of pony ask blogs.<br><br>Both have fairly decent artwork. I tend to find them humorous, but I dunno if anyone else would.</p>

            <p>Writing fics that are horrifically inappropriate for the show seems to be standard now.

            <p>...For grabbing hold of, I mean.<br><br>By which I mean: I also have pluggage! Unrelated to Phobos&#39; topic otherwise, unfortunately-- though his links, there, are <i>highly</i> recommended. They put on an excellent show, last time. (I won&#39;t be able to watch the Livestream this time, have class. But good luck and have fun!)<br><br>Anyway, pluggage: <a href="http://thulcandran.dreamwidth.org/">Thulcandran</a>, a little writing journal I&#39;ve set up. I don&#39;t <i>think</i> there&#39;s any NSFW language, though in the case of a few prompts I may be wrong. The posts are, for the most part, a certain prompt-- an attempt to write five-hundred words in ten minutes. There&#39;s a few other things, a longer short story I wrote years ago, some bits of an attempted script, pieces of ongoing works, and other stuff. Just figured, it&#39;s writing, you guys like writing, or so I&#39;ve heard-- therefore, this.<br><br>Most of the prompts, as I&#39;ve said, are dashed off in ten minutes-- so it&#39;s quite rough in terms of polish and quality. But I am still looking for keeping things at a standard, and improving, so concrit is appreciated-- if you see something that looks like it&#39;s off, or needs work, comments are good!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m impressed with all of you for sticking with this and making it happen. {= )<br><br>I don&#39;t have anything to say about your decisions, because I think they&#39;re fine, but I do have some suggestions for the removal process. For starters, I believe some folks will be interested in saving some of the content to be deleted, so what I think makes sense is to put the {{Delete}} template on the pages in question, or even the {{Speedydelete}} one, and leave them up for a month or so. Meanwhile, we wiki-editing types can use the &quot;What links here&quot; tool and start cleaning up pages with links to the CFDs, and relocate information worth relocating—perhaps a link to X Sue page becomes a link to the mission in question in the References section, for instance. Also, I think we&#39;ll want to remove any associated images before deleting the actual page, so we don&#39;t end up with stray images hanging about (unless they become examples on some other page, perhaps).<br><br>So, that&#39;s my two cents. I may also take a hand in re-writing some of the ones that need it, but I don&#39;t know when.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>We already have a page on the phenomenon of Ficverse Fusion: when two badfics are so similar that they begin to blend into each other. Maybe that can help you in your quest to document this phenomenon.<br><br>Tangentially related: I am fairly sure that the reason why the PPC doesn&#39;t spork many &#39;High School AU&#39; badfics because (aside from just being boring) they all are so incredibly similar that they blur together and if you&#39;ve sporked one you have sporked them all.

            <p>But the NCIS mission wasn&#39;t a complete fusion; the agents simply got bounced from fic to fic.

Sues that are less notable, are not part of the original series, or are better explained by reading the missions they belong to than reading a summary are subject to be removed from the wiki.<br><br>This has been a months-long project by Guvnor, Antigone, and others.

            <p>I had to write a 200+ word sentence for English class, and I thought perhaps since I mention the Ironic Overpowers you guys might be interested in reading it (and admittedly I do have the ulterior motive of learning more about the I O because I&#39;m not quite sure if I understand them). Here it is:<br><br>*In the trope-riddled multiverse of the PPC, the Ironic Overpowers are a real force; for example, quite often, some poor, bewildered agent lost in the labyrinthine halls of the Flowers’ bureaucracy will say, loudly and obviously: “I really hope I don’t stumble into my partner who has conveniently went out on a walk with an Ariadne-like string marking the way home to our Response Center, yes, I truly, desperately hope that doesn’t happen” and then will watch with satisfaction as their partner, a bit weary or perhaps irritated with them (as partners are nearly always irritated at something), rounds the nearest conveniently placed corner with a ball of string in their hand, wondering dourly why they decided to set out in the first place; however, we must not for a moment assume that because they can be manipulated to be useful that the Ironic Overpowers are indeed a benevolent force; on the contrary, they’re known to be quite annoyingly malicious, like a cousin who re-gifts one’s present to oneself knowingly or perhaps a sibling who tells you to fetch something which is closer to them than to you just because they can or the English teachers who insist that the I comes before the E when we can all see that the teachers (and the dictionary, and the other dictionary, and the thesaurus, and google search) are clearly wrong; no, indeed, the Ironic Overpowers can take any statement out of your mouth and twist it to their advantage (whatever that is) in the most horrifying ways—imagine, for instance, that you have just come back from a truly arduous mission in which you had to trek for several swampy miles in order to keep up with your supernatural target before you assassinated it; imagine that you are covered in muck from your toes to the roots of your hair; imagine that perhaps your target preyed on your partner’s favorite character and as a result he or she harps mercilessly on every typo in your charge list in the throes of deep depression; even in this harrowing case, the Ironic Overpowers are quite willing, nay, happy to take your groan of “Ye gods, I’m really looking forward to a shower” and viciously subvert it with their incomprehensible might to make your console go BEEEEEEEP and send you off on yet another mission to the Sahara without even a pause for breath or perhaps a soldier’s bath of a bucket of water dumped over the head; therefore, when walking in the PPC Headquarters, do be careful about everything you say and do, since not only do the Ironic Overpowers love to prey on your statements made in times of hope and joy but they are also willing to use the statements made in times of deep, dark, terrible despair, especially the ones that begin with such phrases as “Surely it can’t get any (insert adjective here) than this”, “At least he didn’t (insert verb here)”, and/or “This has to be the worst (insert noun here) of my life”, and as such, you must always respect the Ironic Overpowers even when not in the multiverse, as they reside in our universe of monotheists, atheists and polytheists with only partially decreased power and the fatally deceptively innocuous name of “Instant Karma”; consequently, do not scoff at my tales of woe, thinking that they have nothing to do with you, but rather, as a acolyte of great understanding and worth, take my warning to heart and do not abuse the existence of the Ironic Overpowers or speak lightly of them, as their power is far-reaching and their malevolence immense, and if you do so they may choose to do something bad to you, like override your automatic reluctance to ramble and loose your inner writer, which, of course, is rather like an untrained puppy that wants nothing more than to run around in circles, claw up your lovely new upholstery and perhaps widdle on the carpet, thus spoiling your merit as a writer in the eyes of your teachers, fellow students, and whatever additional poor blokes try to read your writing and understand it. </p>

            <p>our teacher sees the book as a religious text rather than a set of guidelines. I have had a stylistically solid sentence graded down because it violated a rule laid out in the book. There are exceptions to EVERYTHING in the Elements. To make it worse, some rules are contradictory, so you just have to guess which rule she likes rather than apply the rules situationally.</p>

Anyone remember Five Paragraph Essays?<br><br>Introduction: <s>summarize</s> explain the arguments/statements you wish to make in your paper (one sentence for each body paragraph, plus an Introductory Sentence (a question mark, or something to grab the reader&#39;s *interest!), and a transition sentence.<br><br>Three Body Paragraphs: make sure your strongest argument/point goes last, for best impression!<br><br>Conclusion: restate your introduction, but... stronger.<br><br>*Yeah, spoiler alert: unless your reader is also your English teacher, their interest is nil.<br><br>The first really good English teacher we had marked down if we had five paragraphs in a paper, just to get us out of the habit.

            <p>I would say that sometimes writing by formula can be a good thing, the problem is the degree to which it is required in most high school English classes.<br><br>Used well a formula gives shape and allows the writer to focus on other aspects of writing. Often a given formula exists for a reason, for example the inverted pyramid used for news article - in which the important points are stated first and each paragraph contains additional, but less necessary, details exists in part because during WWII (iirc) the reporters couldn&#39;t be certain the entire article would make it through, and wanted to be certain the most important parts did.<br><br>Another issue I have with a lot of English teachers is that they don&#39;t give a flip about the students&#39;s natural voices, and mark in ways which are stifling.</p>

            <p>There is something to be said for knowing how to follow the rules before you decide go about ignoring them. That way, it&#39;s an informed choice rather than just ignorance. Strunk and White may not be God, but I know plenty of authors who would benefit from omitting needless words, or understanding why splitting infinitives is a bad idea most of the time, or why ending sentences on prepositions is usually silly. Note, of course, my use of conditional modifiers: these rules don&#39;t <i>always</i> apply, but knowing what they mean and when they should be followed is important.<br><br>Bear in mind, plenty of badficcers would tell us that sticking to canon and/or using good SPaG stifles their natural voice. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You have a point, and I&#39;m all for improving my writing. However, Elements is only the latest in a series of these &quot;learn to write&quot; books we&#39;ve been subjected to. What&#39;s irritating isn&#39;t that we&#39;re being educated on writing, but rather that we haven&#39;t actually written that much. Knowing the basic rules of writing is helpful, but in order to learn when and how to apply them you need lots of practice and criticism - neither of which our class is getting. <br>Moreover, the class is not &quot;Creative Writing&quot; or something. It&#39;s English, and high school English classes generally contain some literature. This entire year, we&#39;ve only read two books-- A Separate Peace and Slaughterhouse Five.  </p>

            <p>There are some excellent, really fantastic authors who make great use of such long sentences, and I promise you this, they do not turn up only in bad writing or in high school and college literature. <br><br>It&#39;s really close minded for you to say that, since if you think that long sentences like that only pop up in those contexts, you need to read more, because while styles come and go, writing off works that have extremely long sentences in them as being only bad writing or the focus of high school and college classes is simply incorrect; even then, you see, there&#39;s a massively wide variation, especially once you hit university where thinking in terms of &#39;books I read in class that I would never read otherwise&#39;- which is what you&#39;ve implied there, with that statement of yours- is false because schools with a wide swath of writing classes or English classes have such a wide variety to them, to the point that in one semester alone I read (for three different classes, mind) Roberto Bolano&#39;s <i>Amulet</i>, John Milton&#39;s <i>Paradise Lost</i>, William Shakespeare&#39;s <i>The Winter&#39;s Tale</i>, and Joseph Conrad&#39;s <i>Heart of Darkness</i>; I could have, if I wanted, taken a course on modern fiction, or get into a YA literature class, but then I would&#39;ve had to have read Stephanie Meyer&#39;s <i>Twilight</i>*- which would also be considered &#39;college literature&#39; due to its use in an upper level setting as something to read and examine (which on its own sorts out the illusion that &#39;high school and college literature&#39; are things no average person would ever be caught reading).** <br><br>Here&#39;s a <b>brilliant</b> long sentence (in its passage, for sake of some context) from Cormac McCarthy&#39;s <i>Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the West</i>***:<br><br>Already you could see through the dust on the ponies&#39; hides the painted chevrons and the hands and rising suns and birds and fish of every device like the shade of old work through sizing on a canvas and now too you could hear above the pounding of the unshod hooves the piping of the quena, flutes made from human bones, and some among the company had begun to saw back on their mounts and some to mill in confusion when up from the offside of those ponies there rose a fabled horde of mounted lancers and archers bearing shields bedight with bits of broken mirrorglass that cast a thousand unpieced suns against the eyes of their enemies. A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, half naked or clad in costumes attic or biblical or wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of animals and silk finery and pieces of uniform still tracked with the blood of prior owners, coats of slain dragoons, frogged and braided cavalry jackets, one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in white stockings and a bloodstained wedding-veil and some in headgear of cranefeathers or rawhide helmets that bore the horns of bull or buffalo and one in a pigeontailed coat worn backwards and otherwise naked and one in the armor of a spanish conquistador, the breastplate and pauldrons deeply dented with the old blows of mace or sabre done in another country by men whose very bones were dust and many with their braids spliced up with the hair of other beasts until they trailed upon the ground and their horses&#39; ears and tails worked with bits of brightly colored cloth and one whose horse&#39;s whole head was painted crimson red and all the horsemen&#39;s faces gaudy and grotesque with daubings like a company of mounted clowns, death hillarious, all howling in a barbarous tongue and riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet that the brimstone land of christian reckoning, screeching and yammering and clothed in smoke like those vaporous beings in regions beyond right knowing where the eye wanders and the lip jerks and drools.<br><br><br>That main sentence, and what it&#39;s supposed to show, has been burned into my mind**** for over six years now.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>*Yes, <i>Twilight</i> is now considered something acceptable to read and analyze in university in a class for credit and a grade and not for fun.<br>**253 words, ladies, gentlemen, and starfish. <br>***Please do not read if you are overly sensitive to violence.

            <p>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m perfectly aware that long sentences don&#39;t always pop up in those two contexts, and I understand that I was making a very, very broad generalization. At the time I was thinking both of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, and of some really good books I&#39;ve read in class which happened to include long sentences. I was attempting a joke, which proves once again that my sense of humor doesn&#39;t translate well at all from my head to my keyboard. In the future, I&#39;ll try to clarify things a little more.</p>

            <p>Calling the reaction a berserk button was entirely uncalled for. If the term was in reference to July&#39;s lengthy sentence, she wrote that way deliberately as illustration, rather than any sense of uncontrolled or thoughtless rage, as the word implies. The description is thoroughly unwarranted.<br><br>If it was intended as being used flippantly, it is just as unwarranted, but you also need to remember to show some sensitivity. We can be silly here, but think carefully before claiming anything about someone else&#39;s personality.<br><br>Furthermore, I find it somewhat galling that someone could find humor in the idea of deliberately pushing anything that might upset another Boarder.<br><br><b>However:</b><br><br><b>Rule 1:</b> Treat others with respect.<br><b>Rule 3:</b> &#39;This sort of goes along with Number 2 . . . No Flames Allowed! (The definition of flame used here is &quot;A verbal attack/insult on an individual.&quot;) It&#39;s one thing to say &quot;I don’t agree with your opinion,&quot; to a person, but entirely inappropriate to say, &quot;You&#39;re such a flipping idiot for thinking that, you flipping moron!&quot;&#39;<br><b>Rule 11:</b> &#39;If you have a problem with a fellow PPC Boarder, please try to work it out in private emails. Don&#39;t turn the Board into a free-for-all Flamefest.&#39;<br><br>These first two were, to some degree, already coming into play with mP&#39;s comment.<br><br>Aster? You openly, on the Board, drew attention to and supported a comment with seriously derogatory connotations, about another Boarder&#39;s expressing of her opinion. Not only that, her opinion was given thoughtfully, with clarity and precision, and with the kind of language that lively debate should have. Not only did you support the description of &#39;berserk,&#39; however flippantly it was intended, your comment added to an entirely unnecessary attack on July&#39;s willingness to speak her mind. Your word choice strongly conveys a sense that it is a trial to live through those opinions which must be endured. You have <b>no</b> cause to treat another Boarder&#39;s opinions that way, especially not in public. <br><br>As if that weren&#39;t enough, I am going to do what just about everyone will consider that most heinous of crimes: mentioning the past. Given history, clearly you two have problems. You&#39;ve aired that from an offensive position on the Board itself. That&#39;s rule 11; mP&#39;s post combined with your response creates a personal attack which breaks rules 1 and 3. Even if you hadn&#39;t managed to effectively breach multiple Board principles in a single sentence, there&#39;s a far more troubling aspect to your behavior.<br><br>Not six months ago the Board had an intense discussion about certain behavior in the IRC, behavior of which you were explicitly a part. The discussion was sparked specifically because of behavior which left July feeling marginalized, disrespected, and used as an acceptable target for degradation.<br><br>You&#39;re doing it again. Only this time? You&#39;ve done it on the Board.<br><br>If you say, in your next post, that it was all done thoughtlessly and not intended as such, guess what? That kind of thoughtlessness actively hurts people. Moreover, this time it actively hurts a Boarder who has given so much love to this community, and who has been specifically targeted by actions you took part in.<br><br>If it was thoughtless, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m more disgusted than before or not.<br><br>I know I&#39;m also airing my private problem with you in public--but you&#39;ve bullied a Boarder before. You&#39;ve bullied July before. And you just did, again, in public. There will never be a day that I have ethical problems calling you out for that.</p>
