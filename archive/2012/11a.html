            <p>I was never told horror stories, so I&#39;ve never been wary of the cons. Personally, I love them. Everyone I have ever met at a con has been courteous, polite, and laid back. The fact that they all love talking about the same stuff I do has helped as well. I love them, and I usually have panic attacks in small crowds.</p>

            <p>But pretty much everyone I&#39;ve met at cons has been nice. I once struck up a conversation about comic books with some guy I&#39;d never met before, and to whom I freely admitted I knew nothing about comics outside of the animated verses, and it was fun. <br><br>Plus, RPGing at Connecticon was one of the most fun things I did. I&#39;d never even played an RPG outside of a very short D&amp;D session, but over three days I did three games of Marvel Heroic Roleplaying (ridiculous fun) and Shadowrun, and everyone else was very understanding and cool even though I&#39;d never played any of those game before. So unless Connecticon is a huge outlier, no one is going to do anything more severe than argue over various fandom stuff.</p>

            <p>I mean, yeah, I&#39;ve heard stories of jerks at cons, but I&#39;ve never actually seen one. Nor has anyone I know, actually, not that I remember. By and large, I think cons are pretty much... just what it says on the tin. Large convoxes of geeks of every stripe, squeeing in solidarity. Sorta like the PPC in a way, just magnified and with molecules instead of pixels.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if the PPC invented the exact concept of killing Mary Sues, but Mark Twain was probably the first one to write a story to kill a Sue (specifically, a saintly-child Stu who found out that the real world won&#39;t follow his script) even back before &quot;Mary Sue&quot; was named.<br><br>There have been a lot of stories about the characters entering other stories. The Thursday Next series, for example, has characters entering books, and the first one in that series was published in 2001, roughly around the time the PPC also started. There&#39;ve been other stories about characters from one world traveling to another, fictional world, but Thursday Next probably has the biggest similarity because it actually involves (sometimes) fixing damage to stories.<br><br>Mary Sue as a concept has been around for thirty years or thereabouts, so it&#39;s unlikely that killing Sues was actually invented by the PPC. The setting certainly was (HQ, the Flowers, all that), but the concept itself--nah.<br><br>If somebody steals the setting specifically, then sure, we can yell at them.

But I couldn&#39;t help thinking, <i>Thank God this continuum is quarantined.</i> Can you <i>imagine</i> what a Thursday Next badfic would do to a canon like that?  PPCing that continuum would be a nightmare.</p>

            <p>It was noted earlier on by one if the board members that so long as you don&#39;t blatantly call it the PPC and do exactly what they do, you can use the idea of Sue-hunting freely, since there&#39;s not really any monopoly of sorts on it.<br><br>But your concerns are definitely understandable - their name seemed just a tad too close to a fancy-worded &quot;PPC&quot; to me, and if what you said is anything to go by, they do use some similar ideas, but I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about them for now.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve actually had some dealings with these guys a while back.  Some of their members hung out in the chat and there was talk of some crossovers before they dropped off again.  They do things differently enough from us that there isn&#39;t actually a problem.  There were some concerns that their characters tend toward the Sueish, but other than that we have at least some good relations with them.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>MSTs are pretty much &quot;anything goes&quot; territory, since they&#39;re not generally considered canon, or in continuity. Even if they are part of your agents&#39; actual timeline, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time agents ran into their authors in one way or another.

            <p>So, I&#39;m writing the Official Fanfiction Academy of Starfleet. When I started it, I looked at the PPC Wiki and found that the minis for Star Trek were mini-Tribbles. I, almost arrogantly, decided that those wouldn&#39;t work for staffing an OFU because they&#39;re cute and fluffy, so I created my own Star Trek minis, the mini-Gorn. <br>In my defense, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get involved with the PPC. <br>But now that I&#39;m involved with the PPC, is OFAS the official OFU for Star Trek? If so, how can we reconcile mini-Gorn with the already established mini-Tribbles? Could the Star Trek mini be a shapeshifter, or can they coexist?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if you have any plans along these lines, but if you ever have a need for PPC agents in the story—extra security, fanbrat intimidation, the yearly catastrophe, whatever—Agent Supernumerary would like to be kept in mind. He is a quiet but devoted Trekkie and would love a chance to spend some time around something he likes for a change. He even took his name from a funny story about redshirts where they were all named like that: Ensign Extra, Ensign Cameo, Ensign Walkon, etc.<br><br>Ilraen wouldn&#39;t mind, either. Nume forced him to watch TOS and a lot of the other series while they were quarantined in the Macrovirus Epidemic, so he&#39;s qualified.<br><br>If you need fanbrats, though, I could probably come up with something. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh, who has been trying to bring her knowledge of <i>Star Trek</i> up to speed for years thanks to Nume&#39;s insistence on knowing something she doesn&#39;t; has yet to make it through any one show in its entirety, though.</p>

            <p>...I was trying to process your offer. See, I read a lot of missions on the wiki, and I read a lot of Harry Potter ones because a lot exist and I am a huge Harry Potter fan. (See my username). I stumbled upon some of Nume&#39;s missions, and he became one of my favorite PPC agents. <br>So, imagine my joy when I found that one of my favorite agents wants to visit my OFU! I&#39;m already planning to have Cyba Zero&#39;s agents visit because she has a Trekverse mission, however, there will be a yearly catastrophe where some backup will be appreciated and welcomed. Of course, he could visit earlier, but I know that he can come then for sure. <br>That will be pretty far into the future, though--I&#39;m still busy writing the first day of classes.

            <p>I&#39;m flattered that you like him. I know he has fans, but it&#39;s still a little weird for me. <i>I</i> love him, but he&#39;s mine, so it doesn&#39;t count. ^<em>^;<br><br>Anyway, anytime you want to bring him in is fine by me. Just let me know what you have in mind and we can talk details. Meanwhile, I&#39;ll come up with a fanbrat for you to <s>torture</s> play with. {= )<br><br>It&#39;s hard to pin down how Nume feels about the various series without being entirely versed in them myself, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;s seen everything except <i>Enterprise</i>, and maybe even some of that, too. He&#39;s nostalgic about TOS, having grown up with it, but I believe the general consensus among hardcore fans is that TNG is the best of the spin-offs, so I imagine that&#39;s his second-favorite. He&#39;s probably willing to appreciate when things are visually/technically/narratively/acting-wise done well, but it&#39;s always hard to muster up real affection for anything if it&#39;s &quot;just not the same&quot; as your object of nostalgia. I know he hates the 2009 movie because of what they did with Spock (his favorite character) and Uhura. Something about them ruining the point of the character or some such.<br><br>I, on the other hand, love the movie, and I&#39;m really looking forward to the next one. I&#39;ve seen bits and pieces of all of the series excepting <i>Enterprise</i>, starting with DS9 when I was a kid. I think it was on after <i>X-Files</i>, which I watched a lot. I was a big fan of Odo and Garak, and I really want to go back and watch it through now that I&#39;m older. Haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet, though.<br><br>I&#39;ve made efforts with TOS, TNG, and <i>Voyager</i>, and gotten the farthest with TNG so far. Q (and John de Lancie in general) is awesome and I wish there were more of him. TNG in general has an immensely talented cast, which is no doubt what makes it a favorite. Patrick Stewart as Picard, Whoopie Goldberg as Guinan... and I do like Data a lot, too, though not quite to the degree of most of OFAS&#39;s student body. {; P Oh, and must not forget Geordi. <i>Reading Rainbow</i>... in... spaaaaaaaaace!<br><br>My favorite in <i>Voyager</i> is the Doctor, hands down. Nobody else even comes close, though perhaps surprisingly, I have a bit of a soft spot for Neelix, too. Kes is okay sometimes, annoying other times, but since both my favorites seem to like her, I guess she gets a pass.<br><br>As for TOS, I think my favorite is Sulu. This is mainly because George Takei is a godly human being and we should all be more like him, but you can&#39;t beat an entrance that involves running around with a fencing foil and no shirt on. Pure awesome. ^</em>^ Also like Bones and Yeoman Rand, who is one tough lady, and of course everyone&#39;s favorite green-blooded, pointy-eared Vulcan.<br><br>By the way, are you aware of the <a href="http://alienvoices.net/">Alien Voices</a> audio dramatizations by Leonard Nimoy and John de Lancie? They don&#39;t seem to have it on the site, but try to find &quot;Spock vs. Q&quot; if you haven&#39;t heard it. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since your OFU covers more than the one spin-off covered by the other OFU, I think you are justified in using a different mini type.  However, that doesn&#39;t automatically mean the PPC will retroactively change what we&#39;ve been using.<br><br>Unfortunately, may of the Star Trek missions listed on the Star Trek page of our wiki are either deleted or friends-locked.  Of the ones still readable, one of Tawaki&#39;s is the only one that features mini-Tribbles.  Further, I&#39;m fairly certain we haven&#39;t had any ST missions in a good, long time.  It will ultimately depend on what writers of ST missions choose to do, if and when we start seeing some again.<br><br>Anyone else with a more solid idea of the situation want to weigh in?</p>

            <p>First of all, I read the DS9 OFU and it didn&#39;t include minis, so honestly I don&#39;t consider it a point. In fact, I see it as evidence that my OFU is the right one. :) A little cocky of me, yes, but an OFU without minis?<br>I didn&#39;t expect that the mini would be changed to accommodate me, I was looking to see how to reconcile the two. Maybe the minis are shapeshifters, or they change once they enter OFAS, or maybe both exist, and you can get either. The last would make it easier for Cyba Zero&#39;s agents to visit.<br>I have read all of the Star Trek missions, and my sister Apricot and I plan to write Star Trek missions eventually. We wanted to clear up this mini issue first. And, of course, Permission.</p>

            <p>The DS9 OFU <i>refers</i> to mini-Tribbles, but we don&#39;t see any of them.  And from the chapter seven reference, it doesn&#39;t sound like they would work as OFU guards.  (Picard asks the students to return any mini-Tribble they find to his office.)<br><br>You&#39;ve got Q on the staff of your OFU, maybe he altered the mini-Tribbles so OFAS wouldn&#39;t need to hire guard-minis from another continuum?

            <p>It is a fairly long one, and there are mini-Tribbles (which hermione of vulcan and I were planning to have invade her OFU in a crossover, but that could be tweaked). I might post it up soon and let everybody point out any errors, because I think firemagic mentioned in a recent post about being snowed under in the Real World.<br><br>We could come up with a reason for why which type spawns, although from reading OFUM recently, I thought I saw mention of a few minis of creatures other than Balrogs (the mini-Watcher being one I&#39;m pretty sure I remember, and I reckon there were others too, just not many).<br><br>My thoughts: mini-Tribbles - common; mini-Gorn - rarer species preferring the specific climate of OFAS, or localised mutation due to Q/too much badfic/canon self-defence.</p>

            <p>... there is OFUST: DS9.

            <p>Before writing OFAS, I checked to see if there was already a Star Trek OFU. I found OFUST, and I read it. It was decently written, I suppose, but it had several flaws, most notably no mention of minis and not being finished. So I felt justified writing OFAS.<br>Ooh! If you make your missions visible I can read them! In fact, I was considering offering to beta just so I could read it.</p>

            <p>Actually, that&#39;s more Guvnor of Space&#39;s wheelhouse—him and the other evaluation team members, EileenAlphabet and Antigone68104.<br><br>The last time the discussion came up, though, I do think the Board was leaning toward a wait time before Sues could be nominated for a page, the idea being that they have to stick in people&#39;s heads over time to count as notable.

            <p>It was more that this particular one might end up being mentioned in more missions and in the Official Fanfiction Academy of Starfleet (which hermione of vulcan and Apricot head). So... yeah, he almost certainly will stick around.<br><br>Still, I&#39;ll leave the catagory markers off, and if the evaluation team thinks he deserves a page, then they can add them in later.

            <p>In general, though, I would advise against making new pages on the basis of mights and maybes.

            <p>I&#39;ve been reading these in between work shifts, so I likely won&#39;t remember everything I had wanted to say, so . . . in a chaotic ball of free association, here are my thoughts and corrections:<br><br>To start on a general note, something you&#39;ve done super-well is setting things up way in advance, and making everything run together.  This goes back to your first mission, where you introduced Eagrus&#39; distaste for technology, and the malfunctioning of the disguise generator in the &quot;Mulan and Shang 300&quot; mission.  Both of those pay off down the line, with Cyba&#39;s Borgification and the Borg-heavy <i>Star Trek</i> mission.  The same goes for replacement!Shang in the first Mulan mission calling the agents Huns, and turning that into a running gag.  These sorts of things give your spinoff some real glue between the installments, and help it flow better as a long-running story.<br><br>As for other things I liked, I liked that the mini-Colossi have such strong personalities, and interact with both agents as well the console frequently and in different ways.  You made good use of the comma storm to unite the <i>Mulan</i> missions.  (And also to keep the disparate Ancient China and modern day bits together.  Seriously.  Talk about clashing cultures.)<br><br>I super muchly loved the <i>Star Trek</i> mission!  That piece, while taking the call-forwards from the other missions I already mentioned, was particularly cohesive in and of itself.  I especially loved the focus you put on the Borg culture, and how you turned the Sue&#39;s descriptions and actions back on himself at the end.  Part 2 had my absolute favorite bit, where the Borg&#39;s hive mind started infecting Cyba&#39;s mind (and Cyba cubed&#39;s minds).  This majorly underscored the real threat the Borg poses in the Trekverse, and contradicts the account of them presented by the Sue, which is the sort of thing I love in PPC missions: giving the canon a chance to show its stuff after being degraded by the original fic&#39;s bad writing.<br><br>And now mistakes I found!  (Apologies if these have already been pointed out, but I can&#39;t stay up any longer to read all the comments.)<br><br><b>Mulan and Shang 300</b><br><br>&quot;&quot;Don&#39;t sat tha-&quot; Eagrus was too late.&quot; (say instead of sat)<br><br>Fas Mulan: I just wanted to point out &quot;Fa&quot; is the family name given for Mulan&#39;s family in the Disney movie.  You seemed a bit confused by it (as was I, when I encountered it in my own claim to these mini-fics. :s )<br><br>Between the lines, &quot;&quot;We have to wait that long?&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;Oh no,&quot; Eagrus corrected her.&quot; the font you&#39;re using changes.<br><br><b>Parenthood</b><br><br>&quot; . . . to encourage yet another immanent punctuation storm.&quot; (imminent instead of immanent)<br><br>&quot; . . . heard the terracotta soldier say, now moderately discernibly.&quot; (two adverbs in a row, lol)<br><br><b>Parenthood 2</b><br><br>Alright, alright, we&#39;re coming!&quot; cried Eagrus. (missing opening quotation mark)<br><br><b>Untitled 1</b><br><br>&quot; . . . trying to her mind off her destination...&quot; (missed a verb)<br><br><b>Love and War part 1</b><br><br>Another font change here, between &quot;&quot;Since when would Kes and Seska faint over a dog-man?!&quot; pointed out Cyba furiously.&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;Oh look, he wants to come &#39;abored&#39;,&quot; snickered Eagrus.&quot;<br><br><b>Love and War part 2</b><br><br>&quot; . . . snapped the trio of Cybas in unison. &quot;Then they exchanged glares . . .&quot;  (Oh look!  The missing quotation mark from &quot;Parenthood 2!&quot; (: )<br><br>&quot;Sigma cuffed him with her metal arm . . .&quot;  (This isn&#39;t a typo so much, but the sentence before this one had Eagrus off-handedly referring to the Borg as monsters, so when I started reading this one, I assumed (based on Cyba-cubed&#39;s increasing protectiveness of the Borg) that Sigma was hitting Eagrus until I got farther into the sentence.  You might want to rewrite this sentence a bit to make it more obvious that it&#39;s the Sue getting socked.)</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the feedback, and I&#39;m glad you liked it so much!<br><br>I have fixed those corrections I can. I noticed the font problems when I first posted the missions, but even digging around the html I cannot seem to fix them. They don&#39;t show on the Word docs (the fix worked there) - it&#39;s something LJ&#39;s done/ignored.<br><br>I figured about Fa Mulan, but with &#39;Fas Mulan&#39;, the point I was making was a missing full stop. I&#39;ve made it a little more clear now.<br><br>Ah, the mini-Colossi - yes, I have plans for an interlude concerning them. Zouh might get a bigger look-in soon, too.<br><br>I must say, mission 6 is the one I&#39;m most pleased with - and most enjoyed writing. There was a reason I pounced on it quick - that was one not to be missed, not with my agents, and not with some of those misspellings. Turning the &#39;Stu&#39;s powers against him did not occur to me initially, but as I thought about how to deal with him, the realisation hit me and I laughed so much at the irony. It was too big an opportunity to let pass.<br><br>As it turns out, the author Jack Russel has written a lot of badfic (all of it similar in mechanics, and spread across quite a few continua). There are no fewer than four fics containing the same Gary Stu, Captain Jack Russel (including the one I sporked), although at a glance the others seem to involve the same character under different names and guises. The Captain also appears to have <i>DS9</i> and <i>Tomb Raider</i> in his sights for the future. I know hermione of vulcan has plans to spork the other existing Trekverse fic once she gets permission. The other two are <i>Halo</i> and <i>L4D</i>, neither of which I know much about. One to watch, though, and possibly a call for DMS, Division of Multiple Offences.</p>

            <p>All right, these are my edits and comments, in chronological order.<br>Part 1<br>-I love the beginning bit with Cyba dancing. Imagining all her lines in the voice of the Collective made me crack up.<br>-&quot;With guess which species?&quot; should probably be &quot;As guess which species?&quot;<br>-Keep them mini-Tribbles just so you can keep the scene where one lands on Eagrus&#39;s head. :)<br>- &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be fair on the Borg&quot; should probably be &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be fair to the Borg&quot;. And I agree with Cyba on that. :)<br>-I don&#39;t think you put &quot;Kasons&quot; and &quot;Kason&quot; on the mini list. It&#39;s Kazon, plural Kazon.<br>-Cyba and Eagrus discuss the section of text including &quot;Time to dye&quot; later than where you put it, so maybe you should move it.<br>-I&#39;m not sure if this is intentional or not, but the CAD says &quot;Katherine Janeway&quot; instead of &quot;Kathryn Janeway&quot; and &quot;immanent&quot; instead of &quot;imminent&quot;. Could be Jack Russel&#39;s bad spelling affecting the CAD, though.<br>-&quot;Russel/Seska/Squick&quot; doesn&#39;t need the second slash.<br>Part 2<br>-I love the paper airplanes. &quot;We are the PPC. Resistance is futile.&quot; I usually refrain from internet slang, but ROFL!<br>-I want to see Cyba chase her own eye laser. It would be HILARIOUS!<br>-The Borg are OOC, not OC. I think that happened twice.<br>-Several times, you use non-speech modifiers as speech modifiers, like &quot;smiled&quot;, &quot;stared&quot;, or &quot;grinned&quot;. I didn&#39;t find it detracted much from my enjoyment of the story, but I just though you should be aware.<br>-&quot;We&#39;re ladies,&quot; grinned the three Cybas.&quot; That comment seemed kind of random to me. Also, not a speech modifier.<br>-Poor Eagrus, having to deal with the Collective of Three. It&#39;s awesome, though. I like how they could sort of pick up the Collective&#39;s signals, but they still sort of keep their own personalities. A hilarious side to the Borg. <br>Overall, I liked it a lot. Yes, Jack Russel deserves a wiki page, since the author wrote more stories with him (I claim the other Trekverse one, pending permission, of course). In fact, he might be an multiverse emergency.<br></p>

            <p>Thanks for the pointers; I&#39;ve made the corrections. There might be a few odd modifiers floating around still, but the rest should all be fixed.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you liked it! I&#39;d be interested in Apricot&#39;s opinion, too!<br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d necessarily call the &#39;Stu, Jack Russel, a multiversal emergency, but he definitely counts as a recurring problem &#39;Stu. Multiversal emergencies are usually something really big (like the Assimilation Crisis or a major attack on HQ from the Suvian mirrorverse). I don&#39;t think Jack Russel is quite that powerful, but for recurrance and sheer awfulness (and a certain amount of godmoding), I would call him deserving of his own wiki page.<br><br>Thanks for all your input!</p>

            <p>Okay, so this might be a bit lengthy, but these are some important points that I wanted to... er... point out.<br><br><b>Chapter 3</b><br>Only one major note here, and it&#39;s the way this line is written: <i>Then she shut the portal, missing Eagrus&#39; eye-roll as soon as her back was turned.</i><br><br>My smaller note is that <i>Eagrus&#39; eye-roll</i> should be <i><b>Eagrus&#39;s</b> eye-roll</i>; despite the fact that Eagrus ends with an &#39;s&#39;, the eye-roll still belongs to him, and this should be reflected with an apostrophe-s rather than just a plain apostrophe.<br><br>The larger note is the way the sentence is worded. As it is, the line makes it sound as though Cyba didn&#39;t miss Eagrus&#39;s eye-roll until she turned her back; a better way to write this sentence might have been something like this: <i>Then she turned and shut the portal, giving Eagrus the chance to roll his eyes without her noticing.</i><br><br><b>Chapter 4</b><br>My only problem here is that one of your conversations came dangerously close to being too confusing to sort out who was saying what: <i>&quot;Where did you get that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I bodged it up while you were being subjected to the No Drool Videos.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Riiiight... Oh, and Cyba, don&#39;t challenge the IO! It&#39;ll come back to bite you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And you know what...I&#39;m in a good mood and I DON&#39;T CARE! BRING IT ON!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m going to go on this mission with you, Cyba, but I&#39;m increasingly sure I&#39;m going to regret it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m hyper, crazy - and the IO is not going to stop that. Not today! HAHAHA!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re doomed...&quot;</i><br><br>The only reason I didn&#39;t lose track of who was speaking was that Eagrus kept calling Cyba by name, which strikes me as a touch &#39;scripted&#39;, but that could just be the way he talks.<br><br>While it&#39;s okay to have a few lines written without identifying the speaker (as long as there are only two speakers, or there are several voices speaking at once and the narration needs to reflect a sense of all-at-once chaos), I find that more than a line or two per unidentified speaker begins to feel like a script with no specified characters - not only is the dialogue confusing after that point, but foreshadowing and personality quirks mentioned by a character during such a conversation may not stick with the reader as well as it would if the speakers were identified quickly enough to prevent any confusion, which can take away from the story a bit.<br><br><b>Now for the Nicer Stuff!</b><br>I really liked the fact that the wraiths possessing Mulan and Shang kept noticing the agents. I made an apple cider-drinking game of it. We&#39;re out of cider, now.<br><br>And I&#39;m fairly certain this is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen an agent wage war with the Ironic Overpower. It was equal parts terrifying and hilarious.<br><br>Your mentions of Sar-Plasm made me curious, so I went on the Wiki and read the other mission where it&#39;s mentioned (&#39;Of Sar-Plasm, Sue Pies, and other Affairs of the Organs...&#39;). I&#39;m sad there&#39;s not a Wiki page for the stuff; it seems under-loved. Someone should correct this! -raises hand to volunteer-<br><br>Anyway, all in all, great missions! I giggled nonstop while I was reading them, and that&#39;s a good thing. :D</p>

            <p>Glad you enjoyed the missions! And yes, Agent Cyba IS that crazy when she&#39;s hyper.

            <p>This is not only my first post on the board but also my first foray into the realm of virtual communities in general (to the point where I don&#39;t even have a Facebook) so I&#39;m kinda freaking out writing this. I stumbled onto the original series on TV tropes in august, loved it, and have been wandering the wiki and the stories ever since. Earlier today, or given that it is technically tomorrow at this point, late yesterday, I wandered onto the unclaimed fics page and saw the summery for &quot;Codex Alera Mask of the Titan&quot; which instilled in me the rage-hates and the brain-hurts. I mean really, Codex Alera crossed with Teen Titans? What the Creative Profanity!? So I came here and take the first steps to killing it, or at the very least beg someone else to do it for me.</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you Cyba for your generous and useful gift (if I could just find a duplicator and a Hip-flask of holding I&#39;d be set). On the much less pleasant subject of the subject of my subject (namely Pinefresh calling for aid) I have run out of shows to watch, books to read, Webcomics to archive binge, and I don&#39;t know my ass from my elbow when it comes to fanfics. I&#39;m not completely helpless, I recently started replaying the Mass Effect games. Unfortunately I&#39;m going to be away from my Xbox for a week with far too much free time on my hands so if people could make suggestions in any of  those catagories I would be grateful. </p>

            <p>Okay. Here goes:<br><br>I would absolutely recommend reading Sir Terry Pratchett&#39;s very awesome <i>Discworld</i> series. It&#39;s comprised of several different several  story arcs with each story being a more-or-less standalone piece featuring colourful characters such as Rincewind the cowardly &quot;wizzard&quot; (and his Luggage, a sapient homicidal trunk), Samuel Vimes the watchman, the Unseen University wizards (and their female counterparts, the witches), and so much more. I suggest starting by the City Watch arc featuring Vimes in <i>Guards! Guards!</i><br><br><a href="http://awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&amp;comic=102912">Awkward Zombie</a> is a video-game themed webcomic that I particularly enjoy.<br><br>Team Fortress 2 is quite possibly the best FPS I&#39;ve played recently and it&#39;s free to play (unbelievingly so; it&#39;s the only F2P game that is actually balanced for players who don&#39;t want to spend a penny) on PC. Using the slightly outdated Source game engine, it actually runs on older PCs just fine. Just ignore the Tomilsav and Dead Ringer whiners and you&#39;ll be set. Also, hats.<br><br>If you&#39;re willing to spend 25-ish dollars, buy the Orange Box on PC. It contains the Half-Life 2 (+ expansions) series, Portal, and the bought version of TF2 (more backpack space and a nifty Tommie helmet hat right off the get-go). You will not regret this.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Well, there are plenty of missions around here, of course. I have some new ones further down the Board, and my first is set in <i>Mass Effect</i>. KittyNoodles did a couple of good ones recently, too, and Lily Winterwood, I believe.<br><br>I also recommend Suedom (<a href="http://www.misssandman.com/Suedom/index.html"><a href="http://www.misssandman.com/Suedom/index.html">http://www.misssandman.com/Suedom/index.html</a></a>), the Official Fanfiction Universities (many found here: <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/LOTR/ofum.html"><a href="http://www.misssandman.com/LOTR/ofum.html">http://www.misssandman.com/LOTR/ofum.html</a></a>, although not all) and the Original Series, naturally. Hermione of vulcan also runs a <i>Star Trek</i> OFU here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528580/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-Academy-of-Starfleet"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528580/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-Academy-of-Starfleet">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528580/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-Academy-of-Starfleet</a></a>.<br><br>If you don&#39;t already have the game <i>Skyrim</i>, I thoroughly recommend that on PC (because on PC you can get mods - yay for free new content). If you like D&amp;D type RPGs at all, the Icewind Dale games are really cheap now - old and low graphics, but challenging and quite fun. They also run with minimal prodding even on newer Windows versions (though you might need to turn on compatibility mode).<br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br></p>

            <p>For fanfiction, we have the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Rec_Center">PPC Rec Center</a>, wherein you will find lists of various PPCers&#39; fanfic recommendations. There&#39;s also our list of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_Goodfic">Legendary Goodfic</a>, which contains such perennial Protector favorites as OFUM and HFA, &quot;Don&#39;t Panic!&quot;, &quot;The Very Secret Diaries,&quot; and &quot;The Shoebox Project.&quot;<br><br>As for webcomics, I recommend the highly under-appreciated fantasy romp <i><a href="http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/">Unsounded</a></i>. The author is on break until November 21, so you have some time to catch up before she starts updating again. She has never missed an update, which makes a comic with amazing world-building, superb storytelling, and eye-popping art even MORE awesome.<br><br>And finally, I wouldn&#39;t be me if I didn&#39;t take the opportunity to plug the sci-fi TV series <i>Farscape</i>. I believe you can find it on Netflix, and there is quite simply nothing like it. It&#39;s intelligent, funny and serious, dramatic and silly, deep and low-brow—and its aliens come from the Jim Henson Creature Shop. In a word, it&#39;s quality.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Thanks for the friendly comments and interesting things! I realize that I did a decent job explaining how I found my way into this wretched hive of scum and villainy, but failed to really introduce my self. I live in Portland Oregon, am 18 years old, and of the Male-type gender. my fandoms include the Dresden Files (the books, not the show) and Codex Alera, Tales of The Nightside (although I am not caught up with the more recent books) the Ciaphas Cain books, most of the games by Bioware, Mass Effect in particular. I also used to play a lot of Warhammer 40k. I still have my army and my &#39;bitz box fulla flash gubbens&#39;, so eventually I plan to go back the game store and &#39;Stomp dem zoggin pansy Tau good&#39; (in case you can&#39;t tell, i play Orks). I have many other fandoms but due to it being an ungodly hour to be awake on a Sunday (namly noon), and the complete and utter lack of coffee in front of me, I cant seem to recall them. I shall return once I have rectified the coffee situation.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve got Riese here who is also a fan. I&#39;m not super-into it but I really want to get around to reading the books. <br><br>From the little that I know of the factions, I vouch for the Imperial Guard. Non-special humans with rice paper armour armed with flashlights versus Chaos-infused world-destroying abominations, hive-mind creatures, and space elves?<br><br>Normal humans all the way. <br><br></p>

            <p>Coffee makes everything better. But as to faction preferences, the reason I like orks is that they are just so much fun, their tech is all crude, ramshackle, and only works in the first place because their too stupid to know better. Plus they have some really fun toys and crazy rules.</p>

            <p>I was looking at the 40K continuum page and it didn&#39;t have a mini listed. As of yet there are also no 40k missions yet, but if I do start writing missions I might just try to change that. Ooh! idea! It could be a mini titan! </p>

            <p>It seems like minis usually take the form of the biggest, most intimidating monster or villain in a continuum. Thinking about it further, the biggest problem with finding a 40K mini is  the over-abundance of big intimidating things. As an Ork player, Ghazghkull springs to mind, but if I played IG I would probably want a Commissar or something.</p>

            <p>Recently I checked out Jasper Fforde&#39;s web site. His very good &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series is on the list of quarantined continua on our wiki. However, apparently things have changed since then.<br><br><a href="http://www.jasperfforde.com/faq.html#u">What are your thoughts on Fan Fiction and people making Thursday Next RPG&#39;s on the internet?</a><br><br>Specifically this bit:<br><i>December 2010: After speaking to many Fanfictioneers and understanding the genre a litttle better, I have modified my opinion since writing the following. I still have no interest in reading any of it, but would regard it more as a celebration of writing rather than simple copying. The bottom line is that all creative writing is good, wherever it is, whoever does it, and whatever the subject, and nobody should attempt either conciously or unconciously to discourage those who wish to express themselves. Question: Is the Thursday Next series itself Fanfiction? Does the act of publication define Fanfiction? And how do we properly define publication?</i><br><br>Interestingly, the Q&amp;A also has the initial statement about his preference for original writing.<br><br>If we do conclude that this means Fforde is okay with fan fiction, here&#39;s what I suggest:<br><br>Since the author has tentatively allowed fan fiction, but still prefers original writing, we should make an agreement that anybody who does a mission to <i>Thursday Next</i> should also, once per <i>Thursday Next</i> mission, write something that is not fan-fiction--a PPC interlude, an original story, or even an essay or a poem. That way we get to fix the bad fanfic, and we still honor the author&#39;s preferences.<br><br>Perhaps in-world this could be represented by some sort of portable, small-scale creativity shield generator that agents could carry to prevent ficverse fusion events; the generator would be a one-use item created by taking data from a newly created continuum which has never been published. Since <i>Thursday Next</i> is already a massive crossover, some precaution probably needs to be taken to prevent continua from uncontrollably merging at the <i>Thursday Next</i> nexus.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t realized the quarantine was officially lifted, but I certainly got that impression after reading the latest book, One of our Thursdays is Missing, where the island of Fan Fiction is portrayed as a sort of perpetual celebration of writing and enthusiasm.<br><br>You know, a Jurisfiction exchange agent would probably be a really interesting character for a PPC agent. I might do that.</p>

            <p>&#39;Twas in response to the post Calista linked, before this more recent edit.

            <p>I am currently reading the series for the first time (I am at Something Rotten) and I thought it would be awesome to do a mission in. Because of the meta-nature of the &#39;verse, the agents would have to bring in a blatant (and extremely whiny) author self-insert. Natually, learning that the continuum was quarantined made me go sulk in a corner.<br>It would be wonderful if the ban was lifted.<br><br>As for your idea about having to do an original work every time one does a mission in the continuum, I appreciate the idea, but I think having different rules for writing in different continua (other than whatever the different in-universe rules might dictate) could make things very complicated very quickly.<br>After all, Fforde is not the only author who has lifted a ban on fanfiction (Anne McCaffrey springs to mind) or who would prefer people writing their own fiction (can&#39;t think of an example here, but we could very well be talking about a lot of authors). We would either have to have to use the same rules for everyone or be facing, to my mind anyway, a serious inconsistency.</p>

            <p>I really wouldn&#39;t want to make it an absolute rule. Having rules beyond the usual constitution and common sense things has never been our thing.

            <p>And I think that the &quot;Obama hasn&#39;t done much since he took office&quot; opinion is kind of a misconception. He&#39;s actually done a lot, but a lot of his accomplishments have been a bit understated and marginalized. I realize that there&#39;s a lot more he could be doing, and he did seem to be caving to opposition rather easily a couple years ago, but most media sources tend to accentuate the negative a bit. There&#39;s also the matter of the fact that half way through his term, there was a bit of a shift in power in Congress that allowed the Republicans to have more pull, and they&#39;ve pretty much been fighting him tooth and nail. That&#39;s really the problem with this whole two-party system; for much of the time they tend to spend more energy in knee-jerk disagreements with the opposite side than they do in actually trying to fix things. This is a problem with both Democrats and Republicans.<br><br>Also? It&#39;s going to take a loooong time to fix things. We were told that four years ago; it&#39;s not going to take one term, or even two terms, to bring the country back to where it was before <i>somebody</i> effed up the whole thing. Heck, FDR took three terms to fix the Depression, and in the end it only really recovered because of the Second World War, which we do not have right now, thank Glod, knock on wood.<br><br>Just my two cents. Oh, speaking of cents, Prop 30! Hooray! Maybe tuition will stop rising. God, I need to get a job.</p>

            <p>Our politics are really kinda screwball&#39;d in that regard.<br><br>And despite my sarcasm and earlier comments, I don&#39;t hate Obama. Do I think he&#39;s an idiot? Yes, but like those who completely support him, there will always be reasons for that. And I admit, he did do a great deal with what limits he had - Nailing Bin Laden aside.<br><br>I guess a great deal of my cynicism comes from the fact that I live in the thick of politics, whether I like it or not, and my family is very vocal about their preferences, where I try and keep neutral to the while thing.<br><br>It&#39;s stressful, least be said.<br><br>That being said, though, I&#39;m sticking with my Dig-up-Delanoe comment. He really would do wonders for us right now, and not because Obama couldn&#39;t do it himself. If I recall history correctly, FDR had a funny habit of nailing his political opponents to the wall despite their attempts at derailing his ideas.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s stressful, but especially where I live, you can&#39;t afford to be neutral. Quiet, maybe, but neutral? Nope. <br><br>I really think it&#39;s about time for a legitimate third party, or, even better, breaking up the Democrat and Republican bases to form four or more parties. It seems to work fairly well in other countries: my ballot had 50% of it&#39;s races uncontested, because while Wisconsin is a swing state, there were no serious contenders for much beneath state senate. The other party doesn&#39;t bother when there&#39;s an incumbent.<br><br>SC, if you will locate a shovel, I think that&#39;s precisely what we should do. I&#39;ll bring the flashlight. :)</p>

            <p>As a woman, I feel I can&#39;t afford not to—not when scant generations ago we had to fight through <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anti-suffrage&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=HfT&amp;tbo=u&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NICaUNSEBYXaygGJo4GIDg&amp;ved=0CEIQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=685">crap like this</a> just to get the chance. In the images, I note a recurring theme of &quot;Oh no! If women get the right to vote, men will lose their freedom!&quot; This is represented by men losing their pants and having to take care of children and do laundry and stuff. Terrifying, eh?<br><br>This seems to be a popular refrain among anti-equality types today, too: more people getting rights will magically take them away from people who already have them, so we should be afraid. Rights are finite, doncha know. (?!?!???!!??)<br><br>So that&#39;s why I voted. I think I owe it to the women who suffered and even went to jail so I can.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Plus, I have no patience for people who won&#39;t think for themselves or who believe things blindly because somebody they perceive as an authority figure says them. So a lot of my voting is informed by whether or not the candidate is just trying to sting people along in ignorance and make decisions out of their own self-importance: we can&#39;t afford to have anybody who won&#39;t honestly go into <i>facts</i> making decisions that impact the entire country and sometimes large parts of the world. </p>

            <p>Is it just me, though, or do the elections get scarier every year? When Obama and McCain ran, I didn&#39;t get the sense that the country would fall apart based on the outcome (though I did get a sense that we&#39;d either go up or down a notch in other countries&#39; respect,) and when Bush and... was it Nader? Nope, Kerry. Anyway, it was presumably going to be business as usual whoever won and the main difference would be what kind of legislation got pushed forward in the next few years, and what kinds of funding got priority. I don&#39;t remember any elections before that because I was eight when the 2000 election happened.<br><br>Or maybe that&#39;s just me growing up and elections (especially ones where we have a current president running) have always been this scary. <br><br>What a depressing thought.</p>

            <p>As a Californian, I&#39;m rather happy to say that the majority of the propositions voted on alongside the presidential selection did not pass.<br><br>Why am I happy about this, especially when one promised better funding for schools and another promised better funding to the individual counties?<br><br>Because the majority of the propositions voted on this year were also loopholes.

            <p>You are looking to keep oxygenated blood pumping through the body until EMS arrives on the scene to relieve you. That is what the 2 breaths (though new guidelines say one can ignore the breaths if the victim&#39;s mouth is sort of FUBAR/covered in fluids) by 30 compressions are for. CPR does not magically resuscitate people, nor do defibrillators bring people back from the dead.<br><br>When doing compressions, you need to press down about five centimetres (two inches for you imperial-system folks) on a point between the victim&#39;s nipple line (or two fingers&#39; width just above the base of the sternum).<br><br>Here&#39;s the nasty thing: <i>you will break ribs and dislocate/break the victim&#39;s sternum no matter what</i>.<br><br>Sweet dreams. <br><br></p>

            <p><i>&quot;[...]how to get someone who wasn&#39;t quite drowned, but definitely choking on water, to breathe properly, right?&quot;</i><br><br>Assuming the victim has been through a near-drowning experience and has inhaled a significant quantity of water while in distress, the proper response would be to get them to a hospital ASAP. You&#39;re not trained to go and drain somebody&#39;s lungs, you&#39;re there to make sure the paramedics get someone who&#39;s still breathing. <br><br>You should call for an ambulance, describe the victim, give your address, ask for ETA, and send someone outside to guide the paramedics to the victim. Get someone to fetch you a blanket and a first-aid kit, and put on some gloves before touching the victim again. While waiting for the ambulance you should treat your vic for shock, maintain and monitor vital signs, and inform him/her that they can suffer from secondary drowning, where inhaled water can actually cause you to drown on dry land up to 72 hours after nearly drowning.<br><br>I still use my trusty Canadian Lifesaving manual for reference. If you live stateside, I&#39;m sure you can either become a guard yourself (it&#39;s really fun!) or find their textbooks somewhere at a pool that gives lifeguard training.</p>

            <p>I will have to obtain a reference book.

            <p>And I don&#39;t quite remember the assignment—might&#39;ve been a five-minute persuasion thing, or something like that—but it involved me getting up in the front of people and talking, which is always a dicey prospect. On this occasion, I was explaining that words like &quot;nuclear&quot; and &quot;especially&quot; have certain correct pronunciations. For instance, &quot;nuclear&quot; only has one <i>U</i> in it; it is not &quot;nucular.&quot; And &quot;especially&quot; does not have an <i>X</i> in it; it is not expeshully.<br><br>To make my point, I proceeded to spell out the word &quot;especially.&quot;<br><br>And forgot how midway through. My brain blanked out on me.<br><br>Fortunately, my class was <i>not</i> a bunch of total jerks, so everybody just laughed (totally fair; I had to laugh, too) and we moved on.

Therefore we one day got treated to a really pointless discussion of her weekend, where she mentioned she ate the color orange. :/ We teased her for weeks.<br><br>Around where I live, what nobody can pronounce is &quot;Probably.&quot; We say &quot;prolly,&quot; usually, or &quot;probly.&quot; Why? Midwesterners are too lazy to grant a repetitive word more than two syllables. </p>

            <p>In Arabic, the word for &#39;bathroom&#39; is &#39;ham-mam,&#39; so when you want to go to the bathroom, you say &#39;biddi roo al-hammam.&#39; However, &#39;hammam&#39; is pronounced like that because you hold the m for longer.

            <p>Well... in that case, I think either one would have worked, really. It&#39;s counterintuitive to expect loyalty from people who survived long enough to get their names taken out of the draw and have kids of their own to risk every year, and it&#39;s counterproductive to murder two of their children every year in a blood sport meant to extract loyalty and likelier to cause nationwide rage.<br><br>Or sommat like that. In my opinion. :D</p>

            <p>Agent Eledhwen&#39;s an elleth from the Tolkienverse, and I believe her last job as a generic elleth was more or less border guard that met the Sue about to converge on Rivendell, so I think she&#39;s been trained well enough to warrant such a post. <br><br>Agent Christianne&#39;s a trickier one; she&#39;s, according to backstory, been with the PPC for a while. I&#39;m guessing her first time handling a weapon was when she had to face down some Naruto Sues (offscreen, since I wasn&#39;t the one obsessed with Naruto way back when; Christianne&#39;s original creator was)  on her very first mission (it was, after all, in the brutal old days before the intern programme at the PPC). <br><br>Currently, what with the two of them working in a fandom where swords (or even katanas) would seem very eccentric (if not downright illegal, considering the fine for carrying a katana in Britain), my Agents prefer to use guns, which they managed to get training for in the time while I was working on IAHF. Since I&#39;m personally not huge on guns I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever specified what models they prefer, but yeah. For the most part it&#39;s on-the-job training for my Agents, and consistent practice both on and off missions.</p>

            <p>Freaking awesome idea, wish I had been around to think of/implement it first. I&#39;ve been thinking about the agents that I hope to eventually write. I plan, and again this is all extremely hypothetical, to use a lower ranking Evil Sunz Bigmek named Wazgob. Wazgob will be based on one of my favorite Nob models, it was never intended to be a Bigmek, just a Nob, but he&#39;s &quot;Cyborky &#39;an &#39;ees got lotsa Flash Gubbens&quot; and I&#39;m very proud of him. I think Wazgob&#39;s partner should be someone suave and sophistimacated to counter Wazgob&#39;s general Orkynes. On the  subject of the original post, I have no skill with Kombi-Shootaz or Choppaz, nor do I have experience Kaptanin&#39; a Stompa (much as I&#39;d like that).</p>

            <p>My (prospective) agents are a pair of space marines, who came pre-trained, and a velociraptor, who... honestly, nobody wants to train. He&#39;d tend to do what comes naturally to velociraptors: using his toeclaws and teeth to kill sues to death. Still futzing around with the space marines, but Vid is as close as you can get to being an actual pacifist and still being part of the army (he&#39;s mostly a mechanic,) while Nemedra prefers to shoot things from the maximum possible distance, preferably while their back is turned and they&#39;re holding conveniently still. <br><br>As a boarder, I&#39;ve got a pretty decently functional knowlege of fencing (I had to quit the actual sport because of health problems,) and fairly nothing else except a very primitive, brownie-camp knowledge of archery, which generally results in my arrow being embedded in the target&#39;s foot or sailing over their head. </p>

            <p>Well, you hear a lot where I live about accidental shootings, and it&#39;s always because a) some dumb kid found the loaded gun, either at home or when on a hunting trip with the family, and played around with it, or b) people went out to their hunting cabins, got drunk, and had an accident. Then again, I live in Wisconsin, which is known for beer and guns, apparently.<br><br>I think the general idea of the restrictions is to make it so that it would be harder for criminals to <i>get</i> guns in the first place. I support the measures for having full background checks and enforcing safety training, just because it might mean people like the sikh temple shooter would have a harder time obtaining weapons. (For the record, I do believe that if he hadn&#39;t already owned a gun, he wouldn&#39;t have started on his rampage, because he wouldn&#39;t have had anything to do it with.)<br><br>I agree that ownership for people who want to hunt and things like that shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but it&#39;s too easy for people like repeat felons to get one currently. IMHO, of course. </p>

            <p>...is arming oneself always the best way to deter crime? A gun is built for only one purpose: to kill. Should a response to crime always be &quot;Hey, you&#39;re breaking the law/threatening me, I&#39;ve got a gun, I can shoot you dead&quot;?<br><br>In my opinion, the only people who should have access to firearms are soldiers and police officers.</p>

            <p>There are several other activities that can be done with guns.<br><br>Aside for hunting (which can be debated as a &quot;good&quot; activity, as you&#39;re still killing stuff.), target shooting is a perfectly reasonable pasttime. And while I am not an expert on target shooting specialties, I can assure you there&#39;s enough variety and classes to ensure that almost every legally sold gun has one suitable kind of competition you can use it in.<br><br>Besides, the true scope of a deterrent is: if all people have legal access to guns and a sizeable portion of them does own one... you have to be pretty stupid to actually try to rob someone.<br><br>There is difference between &quot;you&#39;re a criminal, I have a gun so I shoot you for that&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re a criminal, I have a gun so I can defend myself from you&quot;<br><br>The first is vigilante justice. The second is self defense.<br>Just showing a gun, and maybe a warning shot (AKA not aimed at the perp) if things look REALLY bad, can thwart a mugging/robbing/enevworsestuff attempt without harming anyone.<br><br>Of course, it&#39;s all on the conscience of the individual. There&#39;s people who would shoot the perp immediately, and in no way I will justify those.</p>

            <p>My agents use a variety of weapons, most of which are unavailable for me to use.  Two of them use magic almost exclusively.  Another uses a large war hammer.  A fourth is a dragon and, as such, uses her own claws, teeth, and fire.<br><br>About the only agent I have who I can be said to share any real capability with is Agent Phobos.  As you may have guessed, he is a fictionalized version of myself.  We both know how to use various blunt objects ranging from baseball bats and sledgehammers to staffs and two-by-fours.  We also have some experience wielding fencing foils, rapiers, long swords, short swords, daggers, knives, cutlasses, maces, bows, crossbows, spears, javelins (one of my favorite weapons when combined with a shield) and shields (in various combinations).  Mind you, most of these were not real weapons.  They were wooden practice weapons, blunted for stage, or foam covered.  The use was little changed, though.<br><br>However, I really excel at hand-to-hand combat.  I&#39;m a big guy.  6&#39;1&quot; tall, 260lbs (which is made up of a higher proportion of muscle every day), ridiculously long arms, powerful legs, and the knowledge of how to use these things to my advantage.  I am really not above fighting dirty, either.<br><br>-Phobos, who is not as dangerous as he likes to seem</p>

            <p>Your level of combat pragmatism is, ironically, a feature I wrote for the combat style of the Bellamay family in my novel&#39;s organization checklist.<br><br>Especially shields, which are more a weapon than a defensive tool when a Bellamay gets his hands on one.

            <p>Depends on the world, of course, but I tend to either have magic be extremely common, highly restricted by law, or uncommon enough that most don&#39;t believe it exists. Then I have history to back up <i>why</i> magic is treated a certain way: I find that this helps a lot in defining the limits of said magic, and it makes my world building sheet happy.</p>

            <p>I have a lot of different types of magic and treatments of it because I write a <i>lot</i> of different worlds. On one world, for example, the industrial revolution and the spread of technology was largely suppressed because the magic-using upper class wouldn&#39;t invest in any manufacturing plans that would undercut the necessity of having a mage supervise manufacturing. (They&#39;ve since relaxed that to the point where disposable goods, such as textiles, paper goods, childrens&#39; toys, and the like can be produced without any magic in the process, but things like computers, washing machines, and cell phones are all very expensive since they still need to be produced partly by magic.)<br><br>In a second world, the industrial revolution is just getting started, and magic is fairly commonplace, but there are <i>immense</i> restrictions on ever using it on other people, because 99% of the time, messing around with someone using magic results in bloody, bloody death. There&#39;s plenty of research for spells to make things and find things and all sorts of other amusements, but attacking or defending yourself with magic is basically the equivalent of throwing lightning bolts around: somebody&#39;s gonna get fried. <br><br>And in a third world, they just finished the equivalent of world war 1, using a combination of chemical and magical weapons that left giant scars across a whole continent. The world is still adjusting to the idea that a handful of mages and enough preparation can blow up most of a city, and it&#39;s pretty clear that there will be some sort of international agreement to register mages and make sure they don&#39;t learn to blow up cities in the near future.<br><br>Yeah, so keeping the magic in all of these alternate histories in place is one thing that helps me remember which world I&#39;m writing in.<br><br></p>

            <p>Two of my agents - Gilbert and Agent!Caroline - aren&#39;t actually proficient with any weapon.

            <p>(Or, rather, commenting on it. Expanding upon it?

            <p>We have an inbound Fanfic Explosion. It&#39;s due to hit anywhere from &quot;within the next several hours&quot; to &quot;several days from now&quot; in the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic continuum. The third season begins today, and it has been much anticipated. There will be new characters and an entirely new race of pony- Crystal Ponies- to fool around with. There will be hastily-written badfic, and we need Agents to deal with it. These Agents will also need to be up-to-date on the canon, and will have a busy time. I need people on high alert on FiMFiction.net, the Pit, and definitely the Uber Pit, considering all the Sombro/Celestia stuff we will no doubt see. Brace yourselves. SEASON THREE IS COMING!</p>

            <p>Agent!Caroline has been keeping her eye on the series as well as she has been able to, and stands ready and waiting for her next mission. Agent Veralyn... Well, she&#39;ll just have to tag along, won&#39;t she?<br><br>I have an account set up on the Pit; I&#39;ll be keeping a close eye on the MLP:FiM section there in the weeks to come, and I&#39;ll also hang around FiMfiction.net, since that&#39;s where... IT came from.<br><br>In short: Agent!Caroline and Veralyn are braced for impact. I&#39;ll see how well Agent!Caroline can convince Veralyn to catch up on the canon, but as it is, one half of this team can smell an MLP Sue for miles.</p>

            <p>And I rather liked it, too. <br><br>Luckily, Crystal Ponies seem to be Earth Ponies with sparkles.

            <p>I follow the Saphie half on Tumblr, and yeah, she&#39;s gonna turn Suedom into original fiction, but it won&#39;t happen until after she&#39;s written the... parody? I&#39;d hate to call it parody. More like thriller-that-subverts. Anyway, she&#39;s not doing it until she&#39;s done with her current project which features a girl falling in love with an Edward Cullen/Christian Grey like character only to find out that his crazy stalker tendencies aren&#39;t because he&#39;s screwed up in his perception of protectiveness, but because he&#39;s actually screwed up.<br><br>It&#39;s an exciting thing to wait for :3</p>

            <p>Funny, I read that back before joining the &#39;Board, and it heartbreakingly on hiatus back then, too. But actually, a few months ago one of the authors stopped by here - Saphie, unless my memory betrays me, and I <i>think</i> she said they were going to try and finish it (and edit it, because whenever you look at something you wrote years ago, it&#39;s very, very cringe-inducing*) together. So... yes, still on hiatus, but there might be a light at the end of the tunnel!<br><br>*Or it should be, a little bit. Because if you&#39;re always totally satisfied with past works, even years later, it implies you&#39;re still at the same skill level, which is saddening.</p>

            <p>... is that she (it was The Saphie Half, yus) said they were intending to write and publish a generic-fantasy-based... almost sequel, really.
