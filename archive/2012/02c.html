            <p>Unfortunately, &quot;First Encounter&quot; has already been sporked by Bryn and Maslab (who really need to get around to putting it on the killed fic list...it has been two years now).  You can read the mission <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/preview?id=1W9vfceG0_6z8GGZWipL3RnbYc53Kqs20j5NsWwzGPdw&amp;pli=1">here</a><br><br>Other than that, it is fine to claim a fic before you have permission.  Just try not to go overboard with it.  It takes a lot of work to write a mission, and even the most ancient of us don&#39;t get around to sporking all the fics we would like to.</p>

            <p>So, I found my fic, borrowed some bleepka and Microsoft Word is up. Here&#39;s my two Agents, and then something to prove myself (God help me). By the way, the two Agents come from stories that don&#39;t exist, I just came up with them- if there&#39;s a problem, I&#39;ll head back to the drawing board:<br><br>Marikane Cananvi:<br><br>From: Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic<br><br>How He Found The PPC: He fell through a plot-hole while running around in circles as Taris got blown up at the start of the game.<br><br>Backstory: Formerly your typical Gary Stu (Minus the &quot;Everyone loves me!&quot; thing), Marikane thought he was safe from mutiny from his crew, but in truth got thrown off the Ebon Hawk before it got away from Taris. After that, he fell into a plot hole that he made by accident while trying to get through Taris as fast as possible, and wound up in Headquarters.<br><br>Personality: Marikane is still a Jerkass who thinks he&#39;s (mostly) in the right all the time. Alongside other traits such as Deadpan Snarker and Magnificant Bastard (Mostly the second part of that), he also pokes holes in everyone&#39;s plans except his own.<br><br>Likes: Video-Games, TV, Books, and blowing a large hole in a Mary Sue.<br><br>Dislikes: Mary Sues, Twilight, Justin Beiber and people who repeat themselves.<br><br>Weapon(s) of Choice: Lightsaber, some nicked Hidden Blades he stole from a Sue, and a portable Gauss Cannon from the same Sue.<br><br>Department: Floaters.<br><br>Avento Rikkal:<br><br>From: The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim (He&#39;s an Imperial).<br><br>How He Found The PPC: Davis helped some Agents kill a Sue on top of a mammoth (The Sue using the popular Titanus mod for the PC version of the game), thinking the Agents were strange Companions. After that, he took a few hits (From a giants club- long story involving one misaimed FUS DO RAH), and was eventually asked to join.<br><br>Personality: Avento is &quot;the straight man&quot; to Marikane&#39;s insanity. Sharing the Deadpan Snarker habit, Avento is more Tranquil Fury, and tries to talk his way out of most of his problems. <br><br>Backstory: Avento was a typical &quot;Second Dragonborn&quot; who winded up being little more then a Captain Obvious. After being forgotten about for several chapters, he started walking around Skyrim, before finding his sister on top of a mammoth, flinging meteors at several people screaming &quot;Bloody Murder!&quot;. Needless to say, Avento helped the strange people.<br><br>Likes: The works of Joss Whedon, classical music, setting fires.<br><br>Dislikes: Marikane when drunk, badfic, FOX after they cancel a good show.<br><br>Weapon(s) of Choice: The Way Of The Voice, Ebony Blade+Daedric Sword, Destruction Magic.<br><br>Department: Floaters.<br><br>So, about my &quot;Proof that I&#39;m not a bad writer&quot; thing. Here&#39;s an expert from a Glee fanfic I made that parodies a Red vs Blue PSA:<br><br>Rachel and Puck trek through some woods outside Lima, and we join in while they&#39;re middle of the conversation...<br><br>&quot;Puck, for the last time, I will not get possessed by a demon from Jennifer&#39;s Body, just because you think I&#39;ll eat Jack and Finn!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It won&#39;t be too bad&quot;, Puck stresses, but then Artie rolls over from a small clearing they found, with an ATV (The same one from the Achievements PSA) borrowed off Daniel.<br><br>&quot;First&quot;, Artie cuts in, &quot;That movie was terrible, and it lied about Megan Fox swimming through a lake, which would have almost made up for her non-existent acting. Second, can we please get this done with, we have a Halo Matchmaking Session tonight, and I wanna get some Doritos&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Fine, fine&quot;, Puck says tiredly, putting his hands up. &quot;Let&#39;s just do this&quot;.<br><br>Artie gestures towards the clearing, and Puck and Rachel get their video faces on: Rachel smiling, Puck looking like Santana is in his pants.<br><br>&quot;And rolling!&quot; Arte says, strumming a few depressing chords on a bass guitar before lifting the lens off the camera.<br><br>&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Rachel Berry from the Glee Club, New Directions&quot;, Rachel begins.<br><br>&quot;And I&#39;m that sex shark from the same group&quot;, Puck says.<br><br>&quot;You know&quot;, Rachel takes over, &quot;Many people these days are wondering how they can tighten their belts to weather the hard economic times&quot;.<br><br>&quot;It turns out some people in some place, did some things that lost a bunch of money, for some people we don&#39;t even know!&quot; says Puck with an annoyed tone.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, we don&#39;t understand the details&quot;, Rachel explains. &quot;Apparently people buying houses they can&#39;t afford, with money they didn&#39;t have, from the bastard banks that weren&#39;t paying attention, was a bad thing&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Who knew?&quot; Puck says amusedly.<br><br>&quot;Also, we&#39;re having all sorts of peaks now. We&#39;ve got peak oil, peak water, peak temperature, peak amounts of sarcasm Daniel is limited too (Which is great)...&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s just- OWW!&quot; Daniel yells off screen, since he has to wear an electric shock collar to prevent him from being too sarcastic.<br><br>&quot;Peak hurricanes&quot;, Puck continues, &quot;Peak bees...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Peak bees?&quot; Rachel repeats slowly.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot; Puck replies. &quot;Look it up&quot;.<br><br>&quot;The point is&quot;, Rachel says after an annoyed sigh, &quot;We&#39;re all screwed&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Absolutely&quot;, Puck says. &quot;Especially if you happen to be a bee that runs an oil refinery&quot;.<br><br>&quot;But, in these dark times, it&#39;s important that you stay optimistic&quot;, Rachel continues.<br><br>&quot;Right&quot;, Puck says in an assuring tone. &quot;You should be thinking positive thoughts, like: &quot;How can I outlive my neighbours, forward slash arch enemy, so that when they kick the bucket, I steal all their stuff?&quot;<br><br>It goes on for a bit after that, but it features an OC I don&#39;t own who I was borrowing, so I hope you understand.<br><br>Anyway, I hope I did well, if there&#39;s anything wrong, just hoot... or something... and I&#39;ll correct it and send these OC&#39;s to a Fate Worse Than Death- starring in Hannah Montana.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>For a few reasons.<br><br>For one, you haven&#39;t been around very much; we prefer to know who we&#39;re giving Permission to- the PPC is community, and not just about sporking fic. Stick around a few more weeks until you think you know people and you&#39;ve got the hang of things.<br><br>For two, with your writing sample at the bottom, while it is amusing, there is one serious issue with it: punctuation goes <i>inside</i> quotation marks for dialogue. Commas, periods, question marks, the whole rigmarole. <br><br>For three: One has likes of &#39;video games&#39; and &#39;books&#39;? This is amazingly wide! What sort of books? What sort of video games? And by TV do you mean he likes TVs themselves or TV shows? There is a wide swath of difference between, say, Angry Birds, Halo, the Sims, and Skyrim. And with just books? That&#39;s the difference between Left Behind, Anathem, 1632- and that&#39;s just fiction! Classical music has many differences as well- are we supposed to be thinking &#39;gosh, he must be classy and swank&#39; for liking classical music? There are many different kinds of music we think of as &#39;classical&#39; these days. <br><br>Elaboration is sometimes a good thing. <br><br>Beyond that, three more minor things.<br><br>Who&#39;s this Davis mentioned in Avento&#39;s section? <br><br>Additionally, the PPC is not TvTropes, and using tropes as shortcuts to tell us what a character is like is both limiting on your part, and also can be really messy and sloppy shorthand. It doesn&#39;t really do much to help you, as a writer. It doesn&#39;t help you improve- you&#39;re relying on exacting definitions made by other people to get everything across! What about your own words? It can also end up shuttering your skills, because when you start thinking in tropes, it&#39;s very difficult to break out of the habit because it&#39;s so very easy to categorize everything and everyone, rather than letting your characters grow and develop into being like actual people. <br><br>You don&#39;t need to be using those to tell us what a character is like- there are better ways. I, personally, would advocate against not doing it at all, but that&#39;s a personal opinion.<br><br>The very final one is comparatively very minor, and is a personal view: Having a character be from a rather new canon doesn&#39;t really work out, to me, for a few reasons.<br><br>One is that people are still working and playing through the game, and most still haven&#39;t have had the chance to even play it yet- much less afford it! It&#39;s a bit rude to those who haven&#39;t had the chance because it&#39;s still a very new game, and having characters- much less ones supposed to be PCs- from it increases the chance of spoilers for people who still intend to pick it up. <br><br>Two is that fanon and fandom takes time to develop, and a few months really isn&#39;t enough to tell you what direction- or even if there will be staying power with certain ideas- the fandom will go in. </p>

            <p>First off, I agree with July&#39;s denial of Permission.<br><br>On to the Trope issue.  The problem with Tropes is not the Tropes themselves.  The problem lies in one of two areas.  First, as July said, depending too heavily on Tropes can have detrimental effects on your writing.  Second, people use Tropes incorrectly.<br><br>The second problem is what I see more of in this permission request.  Tropes are a way of categorizing things <i>after the fact.</i>  They were not created to be building blocks.  You create something and, when you look back at it, say &quot;hey, this looks like that Trope.&quot;  If you do it the other way around, then you don&#39;t have a character/story/whatever.  You have a collection of Tropes that you are trying to make look like a character/story/whatever, and it shows.<br><br>Remember: Chatacter/Story/Whatever first.  Tropes come later.<br><br>Also I am not a Troper and, as such, don&#39;t know what the majority of Tropes mean.  I don&#39;t know that any of the PG&#39;s are really Tropers.  Know your audience.  It isn&#39;t our job to make your stuff make sense.  That&#39;s your job.  This holds true for any type of jargon.  I don&#39;t speak in gamer lingo to my father, because he won&#39;t understand what I am saying.</p>

            <p>Heya, everyone! I think that, with all the badfic we see, it&#39;s time to plug in to some goodfic. Basically, link the goodfic you find into this thread. Here&#39;s some that I found...<br><br><a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/7819520/1/">Quizzical</a> by <a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/u/3633356/">J.MacD</a> &quot;Quizzical Greystone has just become Twilight Sparkle&#39;s new research assistant. Poor Quiz is the most socially inept filly in all of Equestria. But if you can&#39;t make friends in Ponyville you can&#39;t make friends anywhere.&quot;<br><br> It&#39;s a My Little Pony goodfic and it hasn&#39;t been getting much attention. It deserves a little love.<br><br> Also under My Little Pony we have <a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/7780511/1/">Fallen</a> by <a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/u/1458662/">Nikkel</a>. &quot;A daring rescue, the storm of the century, and a bolt of lightning strikes Rainbow Dash down. When she wakes up in the hospital, she is told that she may never fly again... AppleDash.&quot;<br><br> Yes, it&#39;s femslash. Let there be fair warning for those who do not enjoy pony shipping that it is contained in this fic. It seems to be working out quite well thus far, but I don&#39;t know how well it will work in the long run.<br><br> Anyone else care to throw some goodfic up?</p>

            <p>I know I&#39;ve already said this once or twice, but Sequitur is AMAZING, and deserves capital letters, stars, and sparkles. Sequitur can make NCIS go into steampunk/Victorian AU and still keep everyone in character beautifully. Both the oneshots and the multi-chapter fics have a fine balance of fluff, angst and  humor in the style of the actual NCIS.</p>

            <p>Kansas42 writes with gravity and style. Her three Mentalist oneshots are Cho-centric, sometimes hopeful and sometimes depressing, but always with an interesting plot, though in my opinion Red Silence could be a tad OOC, depending on whether you think Cho reacts to personal cases by getting touchy as he did in that fic.<br><br>Cifre&#39;s peculiar, cracky style is almost the opposite of Kansas42&#39;s. The parody &quot;A Sad, Sad Day of Endless Angst&quot; gets me every time, with so much Bad It&#39;s Good I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s not more well-known.<br><br>&quot;Outside, the rain still pours, weeping alongside you.<br>It is dark. Like tea.<br>And your suit.<br>And your soul.&quot;<br><br>Of course, half the fun is reading the reviews of readers who didn&#39;t realize it was a parody and took it seriously.<br><br>Tromana writes for every genre-from crackfic to angst to romance to humor. Several of her fics play with interesting ideas that might make you think (always a good thing).<br><br></p>

            <p>Face of the Enemy by Soledad is exceptionally good-so much so that I actually read a lot of it, despite its length and the fact that I&#39;m not very much of a LotR fan/expert.<br>The author possesses an excellent and semi-Tolkien-esque ability to describe another culture in detail. He/she believes that &quot;the individual realms and peoples of Harad were based on – and partially named after – the once really existing nomadic or semi-nomadic Asian realms of the early Middle Ages.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Honestly, I like the fact that Alice is used more here. Why risk a car crash when you can avoid it a few minutes before it happens? Why NOT ask the girl who can predict the reactions of people for relationship advice, in fact? Plus, the fact that there&#39;s an actual reason for the creepy-in-love thing that vampires have, as well as Bella screwing up royally with the werewolves, is awesome.<br><br>In fact, I think I&#39;ll go add Luminosity to the Twilight Goodfic list.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone. Sorry for the lack of communication on my end, but hopefully, the first part of my ongoing mission should be ready to be examined by a beta really soon (been trying to work on all three segments as I go.)<br><br>An interesting question has arisen in my mind after playing a few hours of the recent installment in the Deus Ex series, &quot;Human Revolution&quot;.<br><br><br>For those who don&#39;t know yet- <br><br>SPOILER PRAGRAPH AHEAD!:<br><br><br>One of the recurring characters within the game is a sophisticated AI designed to analyse data and communication of news and real events, then to &quot;spin it&quot;, as it were. This would mean that said AI would already have significant &quot;eyes and ears&quot; within the canon world.<br><br><br>SPOILER ENDS<br><br><br>My questions are these: if a similar AI was known to have existed in any canon, what would be an Agent&#39;s policy and &quot;rules of engagement&quot; to avoid canon damage? Would it require tampering with said AI to preserve an Agent&#39;s identity? Or have there been cases where canon AI have some awareness of the PPC and its personnel?<br></p>

            <p>...given the look of things, Gaspard might go for an outing into the StarCraft verse to help untangle some crossovers. The problem lies with one race that inhabits the canon verse: the Protoss. The vast majority of them share an empathic link, some sort of collective consciousness called the Khala. Within it, they can share thoughts and memories with other Protoss. When immersed in the Khala, no Protoss can lie to another and when they die, their last thoughts pass into the link, allowing others to gain their knowledge.<br><br>My question is this: how can we erase the memories of the crossed canon characters from this sort of situation? Simply neuralyzing all those present won&#39;t work as the memories of, say, a Sangheili or a UNSC Marine would still be engrained in the collective consciousness. Aside from disentangling the entire thing before the Nanoha/Haloverse/Mass Effect/whatever guys meet the Protoss (and skipping out on some charges), how could we go about cleaning that up? <br><br>I have a quick solution in the form of a High Templar agent who has been given the uncanonical power to erase thoughts from the Khala in his badfic of origin. I&#39;m debating whether to use him or not because I think this is too Deus ex machina-y for the setting. <br><br>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Y&#39;all are making this a lot harder than it needs to be. Jay and Acacia didn&#39;t even have neuralyzers back in the day, and they managed. {; P<br><br>It goes like this: when enough (not every little thing, mind, but <i>enough</i>) extracanonical influences have been removed and the canon snaps back, everything reverts to the way it should be in canon. The PPC does not exist in canon; ergo, PPC agents do not exist; ergo, nobody can remember them. It generally takes some pretty extreme circumstances, such as being a god, to get around this.<br><br>There are exceptions, of course, but they generally fall into the category of either Broadly Agreed To Be Hilarious (Gaspode the Wonder Dog) or Only Cool Once (the Assimilation Crisis).<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Did you get Permission? If not, you shouldn&#39;t be writing PPC missions.<br><br>To answer your question, though, the standard rules of engagement apply: <i>don&#39;t</i>, if you can avoid it. The agents&#39; SEP fields should protect them from notice by any canon character, including an A.I., providing they don&#39;t make themselves too obvious. In circumstances where the badfic makes the A.I.&#39;s notice impossible to avoid, however, either the canon snapping back into place will remove the non-canon memories, or somebody from DoSAT can probably manually rewrite it.<br><br>When deciding how to handle a situation, the best answer is whatever is a) the funniest and/or b) the most growth- and development-inducing for your characters.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>ugh, Hunger Games movie. I&#39;ve already begun stocking up my Fanfic Explosion bunker with sugary snacks and emergency Pratchett rations. Plus, I was always creeped out by all the overglamourized stuff and the mutts, so I probably won&#39;t go see it, though I will be ready to help deal with the badfic when it shows up.<br><br>Right now, we have ONE hunger games badfic unclaimed. It&#39;s a crossover with Codex Alera, featuring a really blatant Gary Stu replacement of a canon, who pretty much waltzes through the Games. Also, it&#39;s never explained HOW a bunch of characters from an far-away planet with a society based on ancient Rome ended up in future-dystopia Earth. </p>

            <p>Ask Astral Void about her one of these days: she&#39;s a pretty crazy agent, trust me.<br><br>And yeah, I&#39;ve been trying to find some Hunger Games badfic for a mission sometime. The problem is, though, that I still have to read the last third of <i>Mockingjay</i> before I feel qualified to tackle anything from that continuum, so if you have some badfic from there, that would be nice to see.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m pretty excited for the Hunger Games movie. It looks well-cast, for one thing (I mean, c&#39;mon, Jennifer Lawrence basically already played the prototype for Katniss Everdeen in <i>Winter&#39;s Bone</i>, so she&#39;s <i>perfect</i> for the part), and from what little I&#39;ve been able to see from the trailers I think they&#39;ve got most of the overglamourized stuff down pat. We&#39;ll see, but I&#39;m not expecting it to be terrible.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently writing a mission in Teen Titans, involving one Textbook Sue (seriously, she should be taxidermied and used to teach agents about how to recognize Sues), a Character Replacement, and a bajillion minis. However, there&#39;s no listed mini for the DC-verse, and the Teen Titans cartoon is the only part of the DC-verse that I really know. So, is there anyone familiar with comics who can give me some ideas about what those minis would be?</p>

            <p>The trouble with using one mini for the entirety of the DC universe is how dissimilar the various spin-off cartoon shows and films can be from the main continuity - to the extent of almost being within their own stand-alone universes. The Teen Titans cartoon is strikingly different from the various Teen Titan comic book incarnations (especially this most recent one, but that is a disgruntled rant that has no place here.) The DCAU Batman is a far cry from the Brave and the Bold Batman, and so on and so forth.<br><br>A few possible paths you could go:<br><br>1) Use just one mini type for the entire DC universe. Every mini from a continuum outside of the main DCVerse would follow the rules for spin-off continuum minis like Torchwood; that is, they can&#39;t move in a straight line.<br><br>2) Use just one mini type for the entire DC universe, but vary them slightly depending on which continuum they&#39;re from. The vanilla DC mini would look exactly like its larger counterpart, the DCAU mini would look like it had been drawn by Bruce Timm, the Teen Titans mini would be anime-esque, and so forth. A good middle ground, in my personal opinion.<br><br>Possible minis for these first two paths: mini-Monitors (<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Monitors"><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Monitors">http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Monitors</a></a>), mini-Oans (<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Oans"><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Oans">http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Oans</a></a>), Generic (Grey) Lantern power batteries.<br><br>3) Each spin-off with its own established continuity has its own mini. The DC comics, the DCAU, Teen Titans, Young Justice, Batman Brave and the Bold, and so on. This method is messier, but it does a better job of capturing the flavor of each universe.<br><br>Possible Teen Titans minis: mini-Silkies, mini-Cinderblocks, mini-Plasmuses (Plasmii?)<br><br>But I&#39;m just spitballing here. Do whatever you think would be best.</p>

            <p>Also, I&#39;d go with a big bad. Mini-Darkseid, Mini-Trigon, Mini-Starro, something like that. Maybe Mini-Antimonitor, but he&#39;s pretty comic-specific.<br><br>If you do go with the third option, I&#39;d definitely recommend Mini-Trigon or Mini-Slade.</p>

            <p>Because mini-Monitors only makes sense for comics-verse; can&#39;t possibly apply them to the movies or various animated continua. The other suggestions are even more specific.</p>

            <p>Glad you liked it.<br><br>The reason for all the cameos was that I originally started this for July&#39;s game, at the end of last year.  The more you put other peoples&#39; agents in the piece, the more points you got.  The Postal Department was the perfect venue for that.  That&#39;s also why I did singing telegrams.  I&#39;d have gotten points for acknowledging events in HQ.

            <p>Mini-Guardians from Card Captor Sakura aren&#39;t aggressive at all, for example. And they&#39;re quite cute too, being either plush-like or chibi-angel-like.<br><br>Yes, they get two different forms. Basically, since I made my spinoff before reading the other one in the same continuum (by Cygna Hime, who as far as I know isn&#39;t active anymore), I thought that &quot;mini-Guardian&quot; meant a chibi version of the angel-like ones (Yue and Nakuru). The other spinoff used the standby form of the beast-like ones (Keroberos and Spinel Sun).<br><br>Since aside from element affinity and shape they&#39;re the same thing, I then assumed that there was no reason why both forms couldn&#39;t be used.</p>
