            <p>t&#39;s time for the survey results! I closed it after two weeks of no responses, and have finally delivered the goods after looking over everything.  <br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AozhciulOMxndGxISGM2b3BXZWRKQ2lJNUlCUnJsY3c"><br><br></a><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewanalytics?formkey=dDMxcUVyT0Z3ZExqcVI5aVlxc3V6VHc6MQ"> The link to the summary of the survey results, in handy dandy graph form for most things.</a><br><br>Beyond that, here, have a few interesting tidbits of facts that cannot be easily determined.<br><br>Our average age this year is 20.984, almost but not quite old enough to drink; this is, perhaps surprisingly enough, a slight drop from last year at 21.4. That said, it&#39;s still reflecting a slow upward aging of the PPC. At this rate, we&#39;re going to need to start a PPC Parents Support Group. Remember,  folks, spiking the formula with Bleeprin is just not on.<br><br>Rather importantly, this is also the first year in the PPC&#39;s history that we&#39;ve had gender parity according to the survey; 49% is male, 49% female. This is a huge spike from 2009 when 76.32% of us were female.<br><br>25 out of the 63 -39.68%- respondents this year originated from TvTropes. <br><br>39% of respondents had a lapse of sanity and momentarily thought that non-fiction was a genre of original fiction.<br><br>Special mentions goes out to the following:<br><br>Huinesoron, who was the very first respondent this year,<br><br>Akikolo, who can find the original series and pretty much everything about the PPC in an easy to read and understandable manner through our <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com">handy dandy wiki</a>,<br><br>And finally AnnaBee, who listed a record amount of Lust Objects despite the question being &quot;Lust Object?&quot;, with a total of 48 named characters, anyone played by Robert Downey Junior, and the cast of Hetalia, and others she mentioned she forgot which suggests the number is actually higher than 100, and thus proving that quantity does matter.<br><br>Please do not break my spreadsheet next year. </p>

            <p>Hello! I&#39;ve been hanging around here for a couple of months now, and would like to write a mission. So, permission request away!<br><br>RC #: 1112<br>Department: Implausible Crossovers<br>Agent #1<br>Name: Neo<br>Species: Satyr<br>Home Continuum: Percy Jackson and the Olympians<br>Appearance: Neo is a Satyr, or half goat man, and so looks like an ordinary teenage boy on the top while having goat legs on the bottom. He is 32 years old, but only looks about 17 because Satyrs age slower than humans, much to his annoyance. He has small horns and super curly mousey brown hair. His fur is the same shade.<br>History: Neo was recruited from a Percy Jackson Mary Sue fic, for the lack of charges against him and for his unwillingness to put up with the Sue’s BS. He was originally put in floaters, but was eventually transferred to the Department of Implausible Crossovers when he realized that he didn’t like either Mary Sues whining constantly or humans having relations in front of him. He was then put in RC 1112 with Sara.<br>Personality: Neo is usually calm and collected, though he has a high intolerance of stupidity. Being a satyr, he is highly obsessed with all kinds of plants and animals, leading to outright rages when either is disrespected. He has an especially kind heart for CAF’s, and is horrified when they are turned into only mockeries of their former selves. He loves plants even more, and is unsuccessfully trying to grow a garden inside his RC’s storage area.<br>He is a hopeless romantic, but due to the lack of available wood nymphs in headquarters, he instead ships other people together. This rarely works out well for either him or the people being shipped. On the other hand, he does not want to know anything about anything that goes on in the privacy of one’s RC/bedroom/bathroom/closet/car/armoire. At all. Ever.<br>Lust Object: Mallorn Trees<br>Weapon: Panpipes and a Stick<br>Fandoms: Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, LOTR, Classic Greek Plays, Pixar Movies<br><br>Agent #2<br>Name: Sara Harker<br>Species: Human<br>Continuum: World One<br>Appearance: She is short and muscular, with medium length black hair that is constantly tied into a braid. <br>History: Sara had a relatively normal childhood growing up in the northeast United States. She spent her last few alternatively playing varsity volleyball and heading up her shcool&#39;s anime club.<br>After high school she joined the army for lack of anything better to do, but after a year was dismissed due to inappropriate conduct (making and selling crossbows out of the military barracks) and disrespecting a superior officer (going on a rather long and detailed rant about her commander’s continuously bad grammar). From there she travelled the U.S, taking very odd jobs here and there before finally finding and settling down in the PPC. <br>Personality: She likes holding back information about herself and acting like an international woman of mystery, but can’t keep up this front around people who know her for more than an hour. When not pretending to be James Bond, she is a grammar nazi. She has a fairly extensive collection of Punctuation and collects more whenever possible. She is much more violent than her partner,and more prone to fits of rage over OOCness, but won’t attack someone for no reason. <br>Sara is a hard worker and tries to repair her own equipment when it inevitably breaks, sometimes succeeding, oftentimes not. DoSAT has come to dread her visits because she asks constant questions and has found new and creative ways to mess up CAD’s.<br>Lust Object: Naruto, Neville Longbottom<br>Weapons: Crossbow, M-16, Blitzball<br>Fandoms: Portal, Half Life, James Bond,Final Fantasy, Naruto, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Doctor Who<br><br>Here is a writing sample, my Portal fanfic: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7527100/1/Raise_Some_Hell">Raise Some Hell</a><br>And here is the god awful fanfic I would like to spork first: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7979649/1/Harry_PotterPercy_Jackson_and_the_Magic_Demigods">The Magic Demigods</a><br><br>Well, I believe that&#39;s it. *crosses fingers*<br></p>

            <p>For starters, while you might have been hanging around, you haven&#39;t been really taking part that much, from what I&#39;ve seen looking over the last few pages of the board. We like to know who you are and what you are like and see that you&#39;ve participated- beyond just saying &#39;hi&#39; to newbies- before we grant permission.<br><br>For two, I have some questions about your agents. <br><br>Why is Neo annoyed that his apparent age matches that of a much younger human? Why purpose does that serve? Why would he be annoyed by that? He&#39;s not a human, after all. <br><br>As for Sara, why did she join the military for &quot;lack of anything better to do&quot;? This doesn&#39;t really give me confidence in her. That&#39;s the dismissive sort of attitude we see in Sueish characters. You don&#39;t join and stay in the military for kicks in giggles.<br><br>Additionally, she wouldn&#39;t get kicked out after a year due to what she was doing. For one, a lot of military people do craftwork and hobbies while living in the barracks- even selling what they make. For two, she&#39;d not get kicked out for disrespecting a superior officer. Instead, it&#39;d get her in a great deal of trouble, and she&#39;d find life very hard for her while she was still in service. She would receive punishments for it, not get dismissed after a year.  <br><br>Also, why would she break out from pretending she is a spy person after only an hour? Her behavior and what you&#39;ve ascribed to her background-wise simply does not add up. <br><br>Beyond that, I see a few capitalization and punctuation errors dabbled throughout this request- Floaters would be capitalized, since it is referring to the department, and it would be CAFs, not &quot;CAF&#39;s&quot;. I would suggest not taking punctuation advice from pesky grocer&#39;s in the future. </p>

            <p>... in some ways I think that adding the Lego name, and Legoifying all involved, actually helped make the games better. <br><br>By reducing everything to a simple visual state, you can spend more time on things like the plot and gameplay. I&#39;m not saying that games can&#39;t have stunning visuals AND good gameplay, but if you&#39;re dealing with finite resources (not just money in developing the game, but also processing power and memory when it comes to actually running it), focusing less on making things look pretty might help when it comes to allocating a little more on making the game fun to play. <br><br>Final Fantasy XIII is one of the most visually impressive games I&#39;ve played; in fact, I bought my PS3 solely for the purpose of playing that game. But the story didn&#39;t grip me anywhere near as much as the stories of FF VII and FF VIII, and I&#39;ve since gone back to replay both of those. The Lego Pirates of the Caribbean game was just unbelievably good fun to play, even though the visuals weren&#39;t top-of-the-line.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;m not too bothered by what a game looks like, as long as I can tell all the characters apart etc., and with a big movie tie-in game like Lord of the Rings, I think there would be so much pressure to make the game look as good as the films, that it could easily end up loosing out on gameplay. A Lego game would nicely avoid all that hassle, although it may well bring in new complications anyway...<br><br>Whatever, if a Lego LotR game does get released, I&#39;ll certainly check it out. </p>

            <p>This is a very entertaining read. The interplay between the two agents lends a lot of energy to it, especially because the contrast between their reactions is so stark. It&#39;s clear that Xericka goes out on a limb to try and resolve the situation, so it&#39;s nice to see that it works. The progression from argument to explanations to resolution seems natural and ends up being satisfying.<br><br>There&#39;s also a lot of humor.

            <p>Once again, excellent work with Xericka&#39;s lack-of-emotions.  I like that she&#39;s still able to show concern for her partner, and move out of her comfort zone in order to make Gremlin feel better, while still remaining a believable Nobody (and, I think, acting much like a true Organization XIII member in that regard).<br><br>I loved the line, &quot;Mother or not, I will slap you so hard that Tetsuya Nomura will feel it.&quot;<br><br>Also, I would love to read that non-human edition of the adoptive handbook.  I imagine it&#39;s very unintentionally funny for humans to read (especially if the author is actually the Marquis, though probably not).<br><br>Errors!<br>&quot;For all your foibles, you are a relative center of stability and reliability in the middle of a unpredictable badfic tempest.&quot;<br>&quot;a&quot; should be &quot;an&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gremlin was only able to managed a few noncommittal syllables.&quot;<br>&quot;managed&quot; should be &quot;manage&quot;</p>

            <p>It was a really good insight on your Agent pair.<br><br>Xericka&#39;s emotionless behaviour was used very well, I think. It was really funny... and as I already said previously, I think that that girl is starting to have some basic form of emotions. Which is good, expecially since after watching Madoka any kind of being incapable of feeling emotions creeps me out.<br><br>Damn you, Kyubey. Damn you.

            <p>I&#39;m glad I was able to put your concerns at ease. The emotionality of badfic Nobodies has always been a sticking point for me in the past, and I wanted to ensure that I didn&#39;t repeat the old cliches and pitfalls of writing for them. Trust me, I could get into a huge rant about how Nobodies work and what kind of relationships I believe (through my own observations) could be possible given their lack of emotions.</p>

I <i>know</i> CAFs are bad, but...<br>The wiki says one kind of CAF is as follows:<br>&quot;Usually a small furry animal or a bird, this animal is the Sue&#39;s pet. It may be a symbol of her purity or goodness: hinting at the Sue&#39;s connection to the earth, nature, or just innately cute and cuddly things.&quot;<br>I&#39;m not sure whether giving one of my agents a pet would end up being this... it doesn&#39;t really symbolise her purity or goodness or anything... if anything, she&#39;d get embarrassed about it, but really...

            <p>The real purpose of a CAF is to be a plot device to make the Sue seem better, whether it be a small furry animal to make the Sue seem gentle and kind, or some sort of large, vicious animal to show that the Sue is a warrior. I think that a sheep would be okay if it were just a pet. My only question is: where would your agent keep it? I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s enough room in an RC to keep a sheep.</p>

            <p>As I understand it there&#39;s a big difference between a pet and a CAF; pets are animals and have to be looked after, played with, fed, cleaned up after, etc., whereas CAFs are essentially inert blobs that happen to have the form of an animal. If it can go for weeks on end treking after the Fellowship along with the Tenth Walker that owns it, without being fed, and only being brought up for someone to squee over it, or to show how &#39;caring&#39; the Sue is when she takes a thorn out of its paw, then it&#39;s a CAF. If, as an agent, you have to deal with feeding it and find time between missions to care for it etc. (I&#39;m not really sure how you&#39;d look after a sheep; would they play fetch?), then you&#39;re dealing with an actual living being, so it&#39;s a pet. <br><br>I&#39;m not aware of the Flowers having a &#39;No Pets&#39; policy, so I think a sheep would be fine. It might also be a good idea to keep it on a leash, as I believe that sheep eat vegetation, and that could lead to unfortunate things happening if it ever escaped. <br><br>As for the rest of your questions; I have absolutely no idea, being too new here myself to judge such things. </p>

            <p>You claim to be too new for things, yet you were confident enough correct me when you thought I had made a mistake in Crimson Flight&#39;s permission request.

            <p>Well, I don&#39;t consider myself to be a newbie here anymore; after reading through a lot of stuff on the wiki, various spin-offs, and going through some of the historic posts on this here Board, I think I know what I&#39;m talking about for the most part. <br><br>In RL, if I have an opinion I&#39;ll offer it (even if it does turn out that I&#39;m mistaken sometimes), and let&#39;s face it; the anonymity granted by the internet can do wonders for even the shyest person&#39;s self-esteem.<br><br>Having said that, there is still some stuff that I&#39;m too new to have much of a frame of reference for; one of those things is how long it takes / how active you have to be before you stand a chance of getting Permission. Off the top of my head, I can only think of one person who joined around the same time as me (AnnaBee), that has been granted Permission. Yesterday I saw Mysterial (whose name I recognised, which I initially assumed would mean that they&#39;d been around enough for everyone to recognise), be denied Permission, mostly for a lack of knowing what they&#39;re like. That&#39;s when I realised (or rather, fully understood) that the 1 month guideline isn&#39;t just an arbitrary time, but a chance to get to know what someone is like, in addition to the Permission Request showing if they can come up with good agents and write well. Until I&#39;ve seen a few more requests go through, or be denied due to newness, I&#39;m not going to be able to gauge that sort of thing with any kind of accuracy.  <br><br>To be honest, I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;ve been around enough to get Permission; I&#39;d like to think so, but there&#39;s only one way to find out... and that requires me to do some more writing... which I haven&#39;t done yet. <br><br>I know it&#39;s not official policy, but I will see gaining Permission for myself as confirmation of my lack of newbieishness. <br><br>*has set aside the Newbie Hat, but hasn&#39;t picked up a new one yet*</p>

            <p>I get where you are coming from.  <br><br>With regards to Mysterial, the lack of activity was one reason, but it wasn&#39;t the most important.  The lack of reasoning in the agents was the big one.  As Permission Givers, we try to make sure that we don&#39;t let newness get in the way of an otherwise ready writer.  Newness can be a reason, but not <i>the</i> reason.  At least one person I know of got permission after about two weeks, if memory serves.<br><br>Anyway, I look forward to you getting around to doing that writing and asking for Permission.  I am interested to see what you can do.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s dangerous to go hatless.  Take this.  *Gives Regular Boarder Hat*<br><br>-Phobos, hats for everyone!</p>

            <p>CAFs are, like Sues, speshul. Just ask yourself some questions.<br><br>If your agent had a sheep, what would it eat? Would they, perhaps, shear it? Where would it live? I mean, it&#39;s not a cat, or a hamster. It&#39;s a *bleat* sheep. It probably needs to be washed too, or combed, if it&#39;s not being sheared regularly. And where do you even get a pet sheep? It&#39;s not like they&#39;re being sold in pet stores.</p>

What is in store for these two? Will their paths cross with happiness or grievance? Pirate!IggyxOC<br>Rating: M<br><br>Okay, set in the Edo period. Two OCs so far: Akira Yamamoto and... Neko-chan. Seriously.<br>Akira is a prostitute, but from what I can tell, she doesn&#39;t really have any reason to be. I mean, she apparently moved to England as a child and then back to Japan. If you can afford that, you don&#39;t need to prostitute yourself, and from what I can tell, prostitutes in Edo Japan were generally working off debts or quite poor.<br><br>She has one eye, because the other &#39;contracted a disease from over-exposure to rain&#39;. Just... WTF.<br><br>She was also raped by England as a young girl, apparently. It&#39;s... just... no.<br><br>Apparently, despite being in Japan, they all speak mostly English. This isn&#39;t because the author is English, it&#39;s because the author has said that any Japanese will be written in Japanese and everything English is English. Which is also annoying. VERY annoying.<br><br>Oh, and one of the chapters is posted twice, with an author&#39;s note added to one copy, and there are a lot of flashbacks.<br><br>It&#39;s just... -<em>-&#39; And note that I stopped reading at around chapter 5... There are now 8 chapters, including a chapter of random info-type stuff... <br>It just... NVDYUWNQROEBOQBN.

One of them gets an Egyptian-god-induced makeover, a shiny new Sue-name and a Millenium Item, and a her-themed card.

On Halloween though, a certain man takes her in and raises her. She soon gets discovered by James Potter. What will she do?<br><br>This one I reported a bit ago. It&#39;s about Harry&#39;s twin sister, who was abused as a servant in the Potter family&#39;s mansion by Lily and James. Then Voldemort attacks, and adopts the child of his worst enemy as his heir, makes HER his horcrux, and treats her like his oh-so-speshul daughter. <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357136/1/The_Puella_Magi_of_Middle_Earth"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357136/1/The_Puella_Magi_of_Middle_Earth">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357136/1/The_Puella_Magi_of_Middle_Earth</a></a><br>What if the Puella Magi were involved in Middle Earth?

They don;t DO anything, even when facing the Balrog, all they can do is run. Well, Homura does stop time, but she only throws a flashbang at it, instead of, you know, one of her thousands of guns. Also, Magi!Madoka and Kyouko are there and do nothing except scream and run away. There&#39;s a few more problems, such as:<br>The Lord of the Rings exists as books in Madoka&#39;s world, yet it just recently started making multiple witches appear in Barriers, because of the One Ring (?)<br>Kyubey can teleport to Middle-Earth.<br>No one uses their knowledge of the books&#39; events to help in any way.<br>FRODO AND MADOKA FALL IN LOVE. Now, I don&#39;t know much about LoTR, but Frodo (who I believe is an adult hobbit) doesn&#39;t freak out when a pink-haired human appears in the middle of his house, and then goes on to fall in love with her, enough so that he leaves Middle-Earth for her. Also, Madoka&#39;s fourteen and should be in a relationship with Homura. Will someone PLEASE co-write something on this with me?</p>

            <p>That&#39;s okay. *gives you an icepack* It happens. There&#39;s probably bad slash floating around in the archive somewhere.

            <p>So, we all know the strange phenomenon that is the BBC Sherlock adaptation of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle books. However, how would that play out in terms of the Baker Street Fanfiction Academy (which is very woefully discontinued)? Would the modern characters be transplanted into the Victorian-setting BSFA or would the BSFA have to branch into a modern campus for the BBC Sherlock fandom as well?<br>And more importantly, who would be up for writing this modern!BSFA? Because lord knows I would be and I&#39;ve got so many ideas but I&#39;m already running IAHF and its sequel so... yeah.</p>

            <p>Hello people of the PPC! As you can see, I&#39;m new to the Board but I&#39;ve been stalk... er, lurking here for several months. I have explored the wiki immensely and read the Original Series as well as at least a dozen random missions. My fandoms include but are not limited too: Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Discworld, the assorted works of Neil Gaiman, Hetalia, Fullmetal Alchemist, and the Hunger Games. Treat me well.</p>

            <p>First the Other News, because it&#39;s quick:<br><br>- I&#39;ve noticed that the Mary Sue pages slated for deletion are still there, so consider this a final notice to save anything you want from them over the weekend. I will start removing them next week.<br><br>- Also, it seems to me that &quot;Latest Mission Releases&quot; is misleading, possibly restrictive. Who&#39;s for making it &quot;Latest Story Releases&quot;?<br><br>Now for What I Am Up To:<br><br>Anybody who follows the Recent Activity page on the wiki has probably worked this out by now, but I figure I should make it generally known: I have embarked on a project of massive proportions that will involve editing probably almost every single page we have. Why? Because this is my particular brand of insanity. I like doing low-energy, repetitive stuff that will all add up to something in the end. It&#39;s nice to fill up the time when my actual job is slow.<br><br>What I&#39;ve been doing is to systematically go through pages by category (so far, I&#39;ve done the Continua and Department of Mary Sues ones) and make sure that titles are being treated correctly, and also any SPaG or general work that needs doing so the pages look good and more or less similar to other pages of their type. But mainly, my motivation is titles, because we of the Internet have a terrible bad habit of just capitalizing everything and calling it good enough, because we don&#39;t always have access to HTML or other methods of text formatting.<br><br>On the wiki, however, we do. And given that spelling, punctuation, and grammar is one of those things we like to tell people to do right, it seems odd to me that we should continue to ignore this one facet thereof.<br><br>I&#39;m posting about this here because it&#39;s really, really discouraging to look at the Recent Activity page myself and find that people are ignoring the work I&#39;ve already done. Yes, I say ignoring, because I&#39;ve seen this on pages I have already edited, including the Latest Mission Releases: people will add a new mission and utterly neglect to follow the rules, even though every previous entry now does and I&#39;ve put guidelines at the top of the column in hidden HTML. And it looks bad, folks, especially when it&#39;s inconsistent with other stuff on the page.<br><br>I&#39;m open to people doing things differently than I do if the rules are different in your style of English—it doesn&#39;t particularly matter if you use single or double quotes for titles of short works, for instance, just as long as each individual page is consistent. I just want you all to start paying attention and do <i>something</i>.<br><br>If you need them, these are the rules of thumb:<br><br>- Titles of long works (e.g. novels, movies, TV shows, video game franchises) get <i>italicized</i>. Exceptions: some names of series, such as the Firebird Saga, don&#39;t get italics; and the names of games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons don&#39;t, either. I&#39;m not sure why this is so for some series and not others; it may be that some of the names used aren&#39;t official titles of the series. Anyway, check other sources if you aren&#39;t sure.<br><br>- Titles of short works (e.g. chapters, short stories, missions, badfic, individual songs and poems) get &quot;double&quot; or &#39;single&#39; quotes, depending on your preferred style. I tend to include all badfic in this category regardless of length, partly because I&#39;m not sure where the official divider between &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; is, and partly because I don&#39;t feel a badfic deserves being treated like a novel even if it does have a lot of words.<br><br>- All titles get capital letters, but not all words in a title get them (at least in North American usage). Articles (a, an, the) don&#39;t, and prepositions (on, in, of, for, to, etc.) generally don&#39;t, with some exceptions: if they&#39;re used adverbially or adjectivally, emphasized, or are longer than four letters, for instance, they may be capitalized. Pretty much everything else gets capitalized regardless of length. The first and last word in the title are always capitalized, though, regardless of the part of speech.<br><br>So now you know! Please help me by paying attention to what&#39;s gone before and not making me have to clean up after you every time you add a mission. Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Or actually, possibly the Torah as well.<br><br>I suppose I should provide some context? See, I&#39;m writing a story that has been smoldering in the back of my mind for years - the story of the son(s) of Aladdin and Badroulbabour. Basically, the lamp passes to their eldest son, when he comes of age, and he sets out to travel the world. His father has always taken pains to ensure that his sons know as little about the power in the lamp as possible - after the &#39;merchant&#39; issue, Badroulbabour had to be let in on the secret, but he still wanted to protect his sons.<br><br>So the older son, Huan, sets forth to travel the world with the lamp, knowing nothing more than that it contains a djinni, which is a spirit of immense power who will do his bidding. He doesn&#39;t have the specter of his grandmother, whose opinion on the lamp/djinni was &quot;Don&#39;t even look at it, throw it away, evil spirits of EVIL,&quot; nor the context of being raised in Aladdin&#39;s homeland, where he might have known more of djinn - so he is innocent, and has not (at the start of the journey) realized that his power comes from the enslavement of a spirit who should, naturally, have his own free will.<br><br>Now, here&#39;s the problem. Most of what I know of djinn, I know from various old stories, and Wikipedia, and so on. But I know that they are mentioned in the Qur&#39;an, and (I think) the Torah. I really, <i>really</i> don&#39;t want to get this wrong, or step on anyone&#39;s toes. I don&#39;t want to do what Disney did, and render a rich culture and tradition into absurd, Americanized black-and-white glitter-gunk. I don&#39;t want to write a story that reaches into Muslim (or Jewish) tradition and culture, grabs what works, and run off in the wrong direction with it. I&#39;ve already taken some liberties by making Huan of ambiguous race (I&#39;m thinking AU-Earth, a la Sandman-Baghdad), and I really want to avoid cultural appropriation at all costs.<br><br>At this point, I&#39;m thinking my best bet is to do what I&#39;ve been thinking about doing for years, and find a reliable translation to study. But even that would require research - the last thing I want is to wind up with a hack translation. So if you know anything about what the Qur&#39;an has to say about djinn, I would <i>really</i> appreciate your help, and if you can recommend an English translation, or even point me in the direction of someone who knows what they&#39;re talking about, it would be very greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I can tell you that djinn are not mentioned in any of the Torah&#39;s books. Maybe they are mentioned in the haftarah, but I don&#39;t think so. <br><br>However, they are mentioned in the Qur&#39;an, though I&#39;m not sure how much. Actually, there is an entire website devoted to the concept of djinn in muslin culture <a href="http://www.islamawareness.net/Jinn/">here</a>. It looks good to me, but you should probably confirm your information before taking it as fact. Still, it looks like a good place to start.<br><br>Hope this was helpful!</p>

            <p>This is just a fun little thought exercise--another way to look at our agents, I suppose. <br><br>Do your PPCers have any idols? Not necessarily lust objects, although the two occasionally overlap, but personal heroes or role models. Never mind sex or violence, who would your PPCer kill to just spend some time talking with? Who makes them want to be a better (or worse) person?<br><br>Here&#39;s mine, to kick things off. Warning: the last one has a spoiler for the first season of <i>Game of Thrones.</i><br><br><b>Diocletian:</b> Dr. Herbert West, <i>Re-Animator.</i> He&#39;s the complete opposite of everything she lusted after as a Sue--short, obsessive, definitely not Elvish, and so forth. But his single-minded dedication to his mission (in this case, conquering death) and ability to ignore all other distractions are a real inspiration to her. Not that she&#39;d mention it, of course: idolizing a zombie-creating mad scientist might make FicPsych side-eye her. <br><br><b>Ithalond:</b> Harry Dresden, <i>The Dresden Files.</i> This is partially rooted in jealousy--Harry managed to avoid losing his hand, which Ithalond unfortunately couldn&#39;t avoid. But Harry also takes things as they come and still manages to retain his sense of humor, something Ithalond is hugely envious of. Given the chance, he&#39;d sit at Harry&#39;s feet and say &quot;Teach me to be a snarky nerd, wise one.&quot;<br><br><b>Suicide:</b> Khal Drogo, <i>Game of Thrones.</i> This one&#39;s sort of a dead giveaway. XD Suicide doesn&#39;t want to learn anything from Drogo, or take any inspiration from him or anything; he wants to hang out, talk about horses and women, compare the most epic beards they&#39;ve ever seen, and maybe celebrate by killing an upstart idiot in some bizarrely hilarious fashion. Drogo, to him, has the perfect life: a beautiful young wife, loyal tribesmen, a nice horse, a badass beard, plenty of doofuses (doofi?) to slay--and of course, a one-hundred-percent-no-take-backs death. That the coup de grace was delivered by said beautiful young wife is just a cherry on the sundae, as far as Suicide is concerned. He has a sneaking suspicion that a woman&#39;ll kill him anyway, and Drogo gets that, too! Lucky bastard.<br><br>So how about you guys? Who do your agents idolize?</p>

            <p>Did you see the end of <i>Game of Thrones</i> before or after that conversation we had about Su? I has a curious. ^_^<br><br>As for my guys... uh...<br><br><b>Ilraen:</b> Well, there&#39;s the obvious (the partner who trained him, the famous Andalites from his home &#39;verse), but that&#39;s too easy. I&#39;d say someone like Lord Mhoram from <i>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever</i>. The Lords are masters of staff and sword, and although in the time of the First Chronicles they&#39;re all sworn to the Oath of Peace (basically to not do violence for any reason, not even to save the world), Lord Mhoram manages to be particularly badass while keeping it. He&#39;s a model of control, wisdom, and kindness, all things that Ilraen strives for.<br><br><b>Nume:</b> It&#39;s hard to say who Nume admires (I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s capable of it), but I bet he&#39;d do a lot for the chance to sit down with the great literary masters whose work he&#39;s fighting to protect. To find out once and for all whether Balrogs have wings and if there was more than one Glorfindel, that would be something.<br><br><b>Jenni:</b> Also hard to speak for, for different reasons. She&#39;s sort of already doing the thing where she gets to hang out with the people she admires, because that&#39;s people in general. She might like to give Q a piece of her mind or swap stories with the Doctor... well, no, wait. Scratch that. Jenni should never be allowed near the Doctor ever. She&#39;d try to make him talk about his angst, and if it ever worked the whole continuum would probably implode, because I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s built on a foundation of the Doctor&#39;s angst.<br><br><b>Derik:</b> Masterharper Robinton and F&#39;lar, <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i>. Between the two of them they&#39;re basically everyone&#39;s heroes, but they both embody a certain quality of being willing to break one&#39;s self to get the job done, and <i>needing</i> the job, that particularly speaks to Derik. He&#39;d probably be at home in the Sam Vimes fanclub, too, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s read the <i>Discworld</i> books yet. He wouldn&#39;t get most of the jokes, anyway.<br><br>He also desperately does <i>not</i> want to be like Erik, the Phantom of the Opera. He already had the displeasure of an encounter with a mostly-IC Erik once, and it was enough.<br><br><b>Gall:</b> Gall thinks <i>you</i> should look up to <i>her</i>. Beowulf is probably on her list of BAMFs worthy of respect, though. That guy kills giant monsters with his bare hands—naked, even, depending on which version of the story you&#39;ve got.<br><br>I&#39;m probably forgetting a zillion people who would fit for all of these characters. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The Oath of Peace is not actually total pacifism.  It is an Oath to do no more harm than is absolutely necessary.  Whether that be cutting down trees, killing animals, or fighting a war.  It reads as follows:<br><br>Do not hurt where holding is enough.<br>Do not wound where hurting is enough.<br>Do not maim where wounding is enough.<br>Do not kill where maiming is enough.<br>The greatest warrior is he who does not need to kill.<br><br>That said, Mhoram is a very good role-model and a total badass.  I highly recommend reading that series (though I would warn everyone that there is a small portion dealing with sexual violence in the first book.  Nothing explicit, but still...).</p>

            <p>Sylvia&#39;s idol is Arcade Gannon, from Fallout: New Vegas. Sylvia hails from the Capital Wasteland, which was a pretty grim place to say the least. When researching more about her home continuum, she didn&#39;t expect to find many good people, let alone an entire organization of people dedicated to making the world a better place. While the Regulators hunted down criminals, The Followers actually helped make people&#39;s lives better, and that&#39;s what Arcade tries to do as a member of the organization. Not only is he able to be recruited as a companion, but he is also snarky, a good guy, extremely skilled with energy weapons, and was born as a member of the Enclave. Despite this, he still tries to make the world a better place, which basically what the PPC does on a much larger scale.</p>

            <p><b>Laura Dukes:</b> Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day. Admittedly, Laura doesn&#39;t really &quot;idolize&quot; these two according to the technical definition of the word. She just thinks they&#39;d both be fun to hang out with. You know, relax, eat some potato chips, play some video games, and shoot the shit about various nerdy subjects. Fun times!<br><br><b>Danny Richardson:</b> Richard Castle, <i>Castle</i>. The man&#39;s a majorly successful mystery writer - who is friends with other mystery writers, let&#39;s not forget - and crime solver. Plus, he likes a lot of the same things that Danny does: fine alcohol, playing poker, and snarking. Danny would like to do nothing more then have drinks with Castle and talk into the wee hours of the morning.<br><br><b>Rachel Calendar:</b> Magrat Garlick, the Discword series. Over the course of the Lancre Witches sub-series of books, Magrat evolved from the awkward but well-meaning junior coven member into the intelligent and often badass Queen of Lancre. Rachel is aware of her own failings (well, sometimes) and looks up to Magrat as an example of what heights she could possibly reach with enough perseverance.<br><br><b>Gremlin:</b> Prince Zuko, <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Again, this isn&#39;t a true case of idolization. Gremlin thinks that she Zuko would have a lot in common - coming from dysfunctional families, being reformed bad guys, having abilities outside of the norm - and thus a lot to talk about. Who knows? Gremlin even might get a few pointers on how to land her own deadpan emotionless girl.<br><br><b>Xericka:</b> Data, <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>. There are a number of intelligent, stoic, logic-driven individuals throughout the Star Trek universe. What makes Xericka respect Data, however, is in part his drive to become more humanlike. Xericka feels a similar force behind her own actions; like the rest of Organization XIII, she wants to be more than a heartless abomination.<br><br>That took a surprising long time for me to write.

            <p>Well, I don&#39;t know. But here are some people a few of my agents would probably idolize/like to chill out with:<br><br>Eusabius: Aveline, <i>Dragon Age</i>. Ah, Aveline, Aveline. You are always so serious, so moralistic, and so... well, good at what you do. I think it would be great for her and Eusabius to chill out, since Aveline and Eusabius would get on quite well. Aveline seems to be one of like two people who don&#39;t seem to have many issues the way the others do, and they&#39;d make good conversation pals.<br><br>Xanthus Garkaran: Garrus Vakarian, <i>Mass Effect</i>. This one is kind of interesting for Xanthus: Garrus is exactly the kind of person Xanthus would have been afraid of in his days smuggling red sand around on the Citadel. And yet, now that he&#39;s in the PPC, he&#39;d probably love to chill with Garrus and ask him some things on... *ahem*... interspecies relationships. Being a fellow bad turian does that to people, I guess. (Also, because he finally becomes an awesome character in ME3.)<br><br>Cinderella: Hermoine Grainger, <i>Harry Potter</i>. Despite the fact that she was regularly interacting with Grainger over the course of her fic of origin, she&#39;d like to actually get to know Hermoine. She likes Hermoine for very obvious reasons, and then there&#39;s the fact that they&#39;d just talk about spells and all that jazz. Well, that, and the fact that Hermoine is an independent lady who studies and doesn&#39;t really take excessive amounts of BS attracts Cindy to her, particularly after Cindy&#39;s encounter with Subject 23.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t really think of anything for Florestan and Anneli, so... we&#39;ll see what happens with that later. I&#39;ll update again if I think of anything for that.</p>

            <p><b>Adder:</b> Dr. John Watson, <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>. Preferably the Martin Freeman version, but the Granada versions (either one) would work, too. Adder&#39;s partner and best friend is a pyromancer, and her circle of friends includes a vampire, a zombie, a wizard, and a warrior ferret, while she, by contrast, comes from humble beginnings and, besides the rare Bloodwrath attack, lacks the kind of special abilities and skills her friends have. She really looks up to Watson for his ability to keep up with Holmes and be of use to him despite being utterly normal in comparison. Plus MartinFreeman!Watson seems like a really fun conversationalist.<br><br><b>Deuce:</b> Prince Zuko, <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. He&#39;s a fire-user with deep-rooted personal issues, a missing mother, and a father who leaves much to be desired, so Deuce can relate to him. Plus, both of them have managed to come out okay (after a period of being misguided), so Deuce sees Zuko as proof that he&#39;s still on the right track and not likely to revert to old habits.<br><br><b>Kestrel:</b> Ferahgo the Assassin, <i>Redwall</i>. This goes without saying. He was her old chieftain from before she joined the PPC, and she was entirely devoted to him. Since joining the PPC and spending time with more good-aligned people, her perspective has changed a bit, but she&#39;s still quite fond of him and will not tolerate Sues messing with him.<br><br><b>Caleb:</b> Germany, <i>Hetalia</i> and Leroy Jethro Gibbs, <i>NCIS</i>. The second one is kind of self-explanatory. It&#39;s Gibbs. Everyone who says they don&#39;t want to be like Gibbs is either lying or talking about the one from PotC (and even then, they&#39;re still probably lying). As for Germany, well, Caleb has a healthy respect for anyone who can maintain a healthy friendship with someone who&#39;s even more cheerfully obnoxious than Jack. &#39;Cause, you know, at least Jack&#39;s useful in a fight. I envision them debating whether Italy&#39;s obsession with gourmet food is more trouble than Jack&#39;s taste for dead rats and corpses.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> Ellis, <i>Left 4 Dead</i>. This one&#39;s rather odd. Since joining the PPC, Jack has grown increasingly aware of the merits of conversation (or the closest his rather scattered mind can manage) over ripping someone to shreds. Because of this, he would like to try talking to some of the Survivors, just for fun, and he&#39;s decided that Ellis has the most interesting things to say. Also, of all the Survivors, Ellis comes the closest to operating on Jack&#39;s wavelength.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys. I&#39;m a tad stuck on a scene in a Hetalia fic I&#39;m currently doing. In it, I need two Japanese military personnel to be hanging around in a not-very-crowded public place in an occupied territory somewhere in China or Korea. Sadly, I&#39;ve realised I don&#39;t actually know what Japanese military personnel in occupied territories actually did all day, other than apparently &quot;being giant assholes to the locals&quot; (no offence, guys, all military personnel in occupied areas tend to do that - I&#39;m a Brit, I know). Anyone got any suggestions as to what they could be doing, and any information on what the place would actually be like?</p>

            <p>Military personnel in occupied areas most definitely do not hang around &quot;being giant assholes to the locals&quot;. While there <i>have</i> been heavily publicised atrocities regarding that sort of situation, which July has helpfully linked to, the other side of the coin is that militaries do not generally look kindly on that sort of thing.<br><br>For an example, look at the Special Air Service, part of the UK military force. When they go into an occupied area they often carry out what are known as &quot;hearts &amp; minds&quot; operations - giving medical assistance and other useful advice and help to the local population. Hardly assholish behaviour.<br><br>In short, Laburnum, please, <i>please</i> do more research before you even consider writing fics set in war zones of any kind.</p>

            <p>For one, no, &quot;being giant asshats to the locals&quot; is not something &quot;all military personnel in occupied areas tend to do&quot;. If you think that is the case, you are wrong. Do your research. The military is not like that. It has not been like that. Modern militaries are completely different from what you are suggesting with your statement, which is very offensive to those of us who have family in the military, or are intending to join the military. Any military. Because contrary to your &quot;no offence&quot; it is offensive, and no, you do not know, just because you are a Brit.<br><br>For two, describing the actions of the Japanese military in Asia as &quot;being giant assholes to the locals&quot; is appalling. It shows just how much you do <i>not</i> know about what went on during WWII in the areas under Japanese control.  What the Japanese did included the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_nanking">Rape of Nanking</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataan_Death_March">Bataan Death March</a>. Did you know that some parts of the Japanese military were eating their prisoners? In some cases, they cut flesh off of people who were still alive. There were also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women">comfort women</a>.<br><br>So that we&#39;re clear, I am not telling you these things so you can use them in your Hetalia fic.<br><br>I&#39;m telling you because you think that &quot;being giant asshats to the locals&quot; is a thing that happens, and because you want to use it as background for your fic.  It does no justice to the vast majority of military personnel who follow their orders and treat local civilians well- sometimes beyond what their orders entail- and it does even less justice to those who rape, pillage, and murder without care for fellow human life. <br><br>If you don&#39;t understand how terrible the things done were, you should not be writing a fic involving the Japanese occupation of Asian countries and the Pacific Rim, if your initial viewpoint is &quot;Well, most military personnel are assholes to the locals&quot;. You shouldn&#39;t be writing a fic involving it if you need to do all of this most basic research. Being a fan of Hetalia does not mean you are a fan of history, or even prepared to learn it. The two are antithetical in concept and theme. Being cutesy about a time period where so many people were killed horribly, and making the personifications of the countries that did these terrible things cutesy is <i>horrific</i>. <br><br>WWII Germany isn&#39;t handsome or sweet or whatever the hell it is. WWII Germany was an imperialistic and depraved monster that was killing whole swathes of people and performing terrible experiments on some of them- just for who they were.<br><br>WWII Russia is a famine monster, responsible for the deaths of millions, possibly beyond even the nightmareish excesses of Nazi Germany. Many of its soldiers were not prepared to even be able to survive a battle- sent in weaponless, without supplies, to fight for their motherland.  <br><br>WWII Japan had people buried alive. People eaten alive. People turned into genetic experiments for the sake of &quot;science&quot;. Prisoners culled and killed. Mass swathes of women raped, and raped, and raped, until the vast majority of them died.<br><br>Hetalia and the realities of that era do not match up. Don&#39;t write this fic, please. Read up on what you&#39;re actually wanting to use in this piece before you even begin considering actually writing it. </p>

            <p>Um, at the risk of starting something, can I respectfully disagree with the bit about Hetalia not making you a fan of history? Because... it kind of did, with me. I mean, I already liked history, but getting into the Hetalia fandom actually increased my interest, made me want to learn more about it so I could have context for what I saw in the manga or anime. Because most of the things that happen in Hetalia are historically accurate, even if they&#39;re toned down.<br><br>Also, I would like to point out that calling WWII Germany an imperialistic and depraved monster is a bit unfair.

WW2 Germany was a political entity run by a political organization that had the backing of a clear majority of the German people, and which committed all the heinous acts I hope everyone is familiar with. This was &quot;Germany&quot;. She was not making a statement regarding all people who were citizens of Germany at the time. This was the &quot;Germany&quot; that, rightly so, had to pay reparations, whose leaders stood trial at Nuremberg, etc. You can&#39;t divorce the polity of Germany into some kind of &quot;Nazi Germany&quot; that existed separate from &quot;true Germany&quot;.</p>

He has to be injured in the process so they can see his healing factor, and so there need to be not too many muggles around because otherwise people would notice.</p>

            <p>They do, after all, end up selling what is effectively a pair of kids to a dissection lab for money (short version, Yong-Soo is either sharing a body with the ghost of his sister or suffering from multiple personalities) and they will end up being horribly murdered in retaliation.

            <p>Would it be plausible for them to be wandering around off-duty in a city? I was thinking Yong-Soo might run into them when he&#39;s trying to escape with stolen food or something. He&#39;s very easily recognisable (even in Hetalia-verse not many people have smiley faces in their hair), and they know he&#39;s an escaped prisoner with &quot;important family connections&quot; who they think was being held for ransom by some government higher-up, but they haven&#39;t been told that he is in fact the personification of Korea, so they don&#39;t think his return is important enough to stop them selling him to the dissection lab.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Hey guys, I&#39;d like to offer myself up for consideration for Permission.<br><br>The details of my proposed agents are as follows;<br><br><b>Name:</b> Skeet<br><br><b>Age:</b> 25<br><br><b>Appearance:</b> He stands just over 5’ 8” tall, with dark hair that he’s currently growing out long enough to tie back in a proper ponytail. He’s ex-military, and has continued to try and keep himself in good shape; more muscular than athletic, but less so than a full on bodybuilder. Has let himself go around the stomach region, due to the quantity of full English breakfasts he consumes, and his preference for weightlifting rather than aerobic exercise. <br><br><b>Personality:</b> Quite organized and serious for the most part, although he does like to occasionally mess with people’s heads ‘to maintain a healthy balance’. He is a firm believer in the right to a quick and painless end to a Sue, and would never advocate torture or prolonging their suffering. Because of this, he can react badly to characters being inflicted with un-canonical torture, or poorly done hurt/comfort etc. In the past, it has been useful for him to have a partner that is capable of physically restraining him, when dealing with those sorts of situations. <br>Isn’t exactly vain, but is pleased with how he looks, and tries to use the disguise generator as little as possible, preferring to stay human and use the generator for providing appropriate clothing only. <br>Believes that it is physically impossible to start the day without tea and a fried breakfast, and has become remarkably skilled at improvised cooking, seeing as the ‘kitchen’ in his RC only consists of a kettle, toaster and microwave. <br><br><b>History:</b> Skeet is an ex-DIO member (although he has no knowledge of this himself, as he was neuralyzed after leaving), and is currently working for the Department of Mary Sues. Hailing from World One, he joined the PPC after filling in an online application form, assuming that it was just a joke. After returning one night from the pub, he found an agent and a portal to HQ waiting for him, his application being successful. He then found himself in front of the Marquis de Sod, slightly drunk, where he managed to land a position in the DMS, most likely due to his prior combat experience with the British Army, although his recollection of that conversation is quite hazy. Upon waking, his first thought was that he’d had a particularly strange dream, although his partner was able to easily convince him otherwise, as they were given a mission almost immediately. Details of his recruitment into the DIO, and his subsequent departure back into the DMS, are currently unknown. He is currently waiting to be assigned a new partner, and is under the neuralyzer-induced belief that this is because he allowed his former one to ‘retire’ into the LotR continuum after finishing an assignment there. There is a note in his personnel file which states that he is prohibited from using a neuralyzer, although he claims to have no memory of the incident that led to this rather unique ban. <br><br><b>Fandoms:</b> Avatar: The Last Airbender, Battlestar Galactica, Department 19, Ghost in the Shell, Harry Potter, Hellsing, Highschool of the Dead, James Bond, Lord of the Rings, the Lost Fleet, NCIS, Neon Genesis Evangelion, the Old Kingdom, Tales of the Ketty Jay, Trigun, Wheel of Time. He is also a newly converted ‘brony’, although he hasn’t even admitted this fully to himself yet.  <br><br><b>Department:</b> DMS Freelance Division(currently only authorized to operate in the smaller fandoms). <br><br><b>Lust Objects:</b> Rei Miyamoto (Highschool of the Dead), The Major (Ghost in the Shell), Ziva David (NCIS). Wonders what it says about his psyche that all of his L.O.s could probably take him in a fight. <br>Also has strange L.O.-like tendencies around particular items of technology, most of which are Sci-Fi vehicles (in that he will want to go and see them regardless of how mission appropriate it is, and will get murderous if people mess with them). <br><br><b>Favorites:</b> Vampires (non-sparkly), Mechs and other cool machines/vehicles/mechanical systems, gothic artwork and architecture.<br><br><b>Weapons:</b> Prefers to use guns, and will take a crossbow over a longbow when in fantasy settings. Likes to keep at least one blade (preferably concealable) on him at all times. Is quite knowledge about a wide range of weapons. <br><br><br><b>Name:</b> Amelia Renner<br><br><b>Age:</b> 16<br><br><b>Appearance:</b> 5’ 2” tall, with a skinny build (due to a lack of food rather than choice), with brown hair and eyes. Hates the fact that her hair and eyes are the same colour (and above all, brown) because she thinks it makes her look boring. Likes to wear bright colours and striped clothing, particularly leggings and skirts. <br><br><b>Personality:</b> A little scatter-brained, and can be quite fangirly when excited; excitement may lead to her momentarily overcoming her usual shy nature around new people. She is aware that she may need to tone down such behavior (after being told off by the Marquis de Sod for hyperventilating at the thought of actually going inside the continua of her favourite stories), and is trying with a great deal of sincerity, if not much actual success. <br>She comes from a rather poor family in World One, and has read a lot of fanfic because it is cheaper than books, and more convenient than libraries (which she still regards as one of the world’s greatest things). As such, she has a surprisingly high tolerance for badfic, and had even started reading one or two legendary badfic pieces before joining the PPC. Despite her joy upon discovering the idea of fanfic (stories about her favourite characters, but available for free whenever she wanted to read them), she was appalled at the quality of writing out there. While reading fanfic, she will quite happily ignore any level of OOCness, and does not resent the inclusion of OCs, as long as the stories are interesting, but has serious anger management problems when it comes to SPaG errors (as far as she is concerned people are free to reinterpret characters and add their own if they wish, as long as it makes for a good story, but there are RULES about writing, and there is no excuse for not following them!). <br>Has a friendly and bubbly personality when around people she is comfortable with, although is very shy around new people, often failing to make a good first impression due to nerves. She is easily spooked, and tends to fall over when startled. <br>Will treasure any gift given to her, especially if it is a good new book. <br><br><b>History:</b> She has just joined the PPC; after dosing off at her computer in World One while reading a Harry Potter fanfic, she was rudely awakened by hitting the floor. At first assuming that she was in her home, she was greeted by the sight of a giant daisy in a pinstripe suit. An impartial observer (had there been one at the time), would have struggled to say who was more surprised; Amelia, or the Marquis de Sod (although the Marquis certainly recovered quicker). After her panic attack had subsided, and the Marquis was able to explain where she was, and the purpose of the PPC, she volunteered on the spot. <br><br><b>Fandoms:</b> Harry Potter, Bleach, Narnia, Stratanavigte, Discworld. <br><br><b>Department:</b> Just joined the PPC and has been assigned to DMS Freelance Division.<br><br><b>Lust Objects:</b> Legolas, Aragorn (LotR), Vimes (Discworld), Snape, Sirius (Harry Potter), Prince Caspian (Narnia), Renji Abarai, Toshiro Hitsugaya (Bleach). Has a tendency to develop new ones at the drop of a hat, although most of these will short term crushes rather than full blown infatuations.  <br><br><b>Favorites:</b> Libraries, books, good writing.<br><br><b>Weapons:</b> No previous weapons experience.<br><br><br>As a sample of my writing ability, I offer my agents meeting each other for the first time:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJgqJF0p4iazBhkpZERqlt6d5jfx4DDD6dsf21Rt64g/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJgqJF0p4iazBhkpZERqlt6d5jfx4DDD6dsf21Rt64g/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJgqJF0p4iazBhkpZERqlt6d5jfx4DDD6dsf21Rt64g/edit</a></a><br>(Hopefully it&#39;s there; this is the first time I&#39;ve used Google Docs)<br><br>And the first piece that I intend to spork can be found here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783265/1/When_Magic_Collides"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783265/1/When_Magic_Collides">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783265/1/When_Magic_Collides</a></a><br>The writing sample is intended to be the prologue for this mission.<br><br>I&#39;ll be happy to answer any questions anyone has about my agents etc. Any comments or feedback will be most appreciated (especially any along the lines of &#39;Permission Granted&#39;!).<br><br>Thanks for reading,<br><br>-the Irish Samurai <br></p>

            <p>(As a beforehand note, I had this written up before VM posted, I was just working on the extensive &#39;concrit&#39; stuff.)<br><br><br>Okay....<br><br><br>A few comments, here and there.<br><br>For one, line breaks between paragraphs are your friends. On the internet, it is much easier to read when there are line breaks between paragraphs, because indents usually do not work. It made it difficult to read your agent profiles and follow your story at times.<br><br>That said, I rather like both of your agents. Skeet seems rather interesting, and in a mysterious-but-not-really way, between his temporary time in DIO, his time in the British Army, and whatever led to him not being allowed to use a Neuralyzer. (Is this a noodle incident, or is it going to be developed further in the future, I wonder?) I also wonder how he&#39;s able to successfully make a fried breakfast with the accutrements you described. <br><br>Why is he only authorized to work in smaller fandoms, however?<br><br>With Amelia, on the other hand, she&#39;s quite interesting. What sort of flavor of excitable fangirl is she? Does she deflate easily? Or does she manage to power on through sheerly on fangirl energy alone? What happens after it wears off? How will you manage to work with stories that have severe OOCness when she doesn&#39;t pay attention to it? Is this something that is going to change throughout the missions? Why or why not? You don&#39;t have to answer that right now, but it is something you need to consider if you have not yet.<br><br>The amount of LOs (and the variety) are interesting. I trust, going from what you said, these are going to change with time? That will be neat to watch.<br><br>Moving on to the story itself, I have a few comments.<br><br>How is it that Skeet is bad at navigating HQ? Does that mean he isn&#39;t able to not pay attention to wandering around? Getting lost should mean he just reaches where he&#39;s going quicker, if he has no idea where he is. <br><br>My comment about line breaks after paragraphs earlier still stands. Also, you have some strange spots where the sentence suddenly cuts and begins again on the next line, such as with the mission beep.<br><br>Beyond that:<br><br><i>“Sorry about that, here, let me help”.

These are not things that warrant capitalization after a line of dialogue.<br><br><i>“We should have time for a quick tour at least; that’s my room, that’ll be yours, you can put all your stuff in there, and through there is the kitchen and bathroom. “ He announced, indicating the appropriate doors.</i><br><br>Instead, it should be:<br><br><i>“We should have time for a quick tour at least; that’s my room, that’ll be yours, you can put all your stuff in there, and through there is the kitchen and bathroom,“ he announced, indicating the appropriate doors.</i><br><br>This sort of error is peppered through your story.<br><br><i>Skeet had been skimming through the DoI report for their mission fic, wincing occasionally, and had just finished when he became aware of the young girl standing behind him.</i><br><br>Is Amelia really a &#39;young girl&#39; at sixteen?

If you are going based off of the image on the wiki, that is a vaguely shoddy replacement done by someone who showed up and promptly replaced all the flash patch art he could with things that were done to represent being on actual &#39;cloth&#39;. So, it&#39;s not actually dark grey.<br><br><i>‘Yup, definitely a newbie’ Skeet thought to himself as he selected one for her. “Here, this’ll do for now.” He said, handing her a fairly normal looking kitchen knife.</i> You would do well with some form of punctuation at the end of that thought.<br><br>That said, I rather enjoyed it.<br><br>You write well- aside from a few errors (but a beta can fix those; even a double glance on your part would be able to, with some of these).<br><br>The sense of humor was very, very light, but it was present, if subtle.

Please keep in mind that now that you have permission you are not allowed to wander away, and we now fully expect you to continue answering the questions of clueless newbies as you have already been doing a good job, and we are lazy and like it when others answer them (and correctly, to boot). <br></p>

            <p>To address your comments:<br><br>I will try to keep a better eye on my paragraph breaks.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you like both of my agents. As for Skeet not being allowed to use a neuralyzer, I&#39;m currently intending on that being an extremely noodley noodle-incident, simply because Skeet himself genuinely has no recollection of what happened. I am however planning on having Skeet (and others) speculate on what he could have done. I might also use Skeet grabbing someone else&#39;s neuralyzer and running amok with it as his version of going flamerthrower crazy (if it ever comes up).<br><br>Going slightly off-topic here, should neuralyzer be capitalised? I notice that you did, and I remember a post (written by Neshomeh I think) saying that Bleeprin should always be capitalised, but can&#39;t remember the reason given for that and can&#39;t find it now to check. On the wiki, the page for the neuralyzer doesn&#39;t capitalise it, but I think I&#39;ve seen it both capitalised and not while reading spin-offs. <br><br>The improvised cooking thing comes from my history working in a kitchen and being a uni student with a slightly dodgy cooker one year. You&#39;d be surprised at what works if you&#39;re desperate enough to try it. According to a former university lecturer of mine, it is possible to cook bacon in a matter of seconds using hair straighteners, due to the temperatures they can reach. I haven&#39;t tried that one, but I am intrigued by it. <br><br>By &#39;smaller fandom&#39; I meant one that would be able to fix itself without the canons needing neuralyzation (i.e. nothing to do with physical size, but more about the quantity of badfic it has managed to attract). In the Original Series, I don&#39;t remember neuralyzation occurring, once the Sue was dead the canon reverted to how it should be (effectively erasing any non-canonical memories).<br><br>Rather than them not being authorised to act in the more corrupted continua, I now think it makes more sense for it to be a case of, if two missions come up at the same time, and there&#39;s only them and one other team that could go on the missions, they&#39;ll get sent into the least corrupted continua. Obviously if they do end up in a situation where a canon character needs neuralyzing, they should just be able to send them through to FicPsych. <br><br>I plan on keeping to some of the more obscure continua at first (due to Skeet not being allowed a neuralyzer, and I&#39;m imagining that the potential for accidents/misuse means that they aren&#39;t issued to newbies). Their first mission will be in the Old Kingdom, and if memory serves, there have only been 3 recorded missions there, all dealt with by DMS, and I don&#39;t think any of the agents involved used a neuralyzer.<br><br>With regards to Amelia, I see her as being almost perpetually excitable and cheerful (when she isn&#39;t being nervous and shy). I&#39;m hoping that I will remember to have her bounce between these two behaviours whenever she meets someone new, as her scatterbrained nature causes her to &#39;forget&#39; her shyness. <br><br>As for what happens when her excitement actually gets worn down, I&#39;m not completely sure about that yet. Currently I&#39;m thinking that the only thing that will stop her is sheer exhaustion, and that she will be <s>irritatingly</s> bouncy and excitable until she literally runs out of energy and just curls up asleep, wherever she happens to be at the time (no doubt expecting Skeet to return her to their RC if she&#39;s outside of it at the time). <br><br>Regarding the ignoring of OOCness, it&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t pay attention to it, as such, but that she doesn&#39;t mind it when she&#39;s reading (yes, Amelia is the kind of person that will still read fanfic, for pleasure, while working at the PPC). She will then likley end up forwarding some of them onto Intelligence, maybe even having some of those returned to her for missions. She personally isn&#39;t bothered by OOCness, but she&#39;s aware that the PPC is, or at the very least she will be <i>made</i> aware of that once Skeet catches her letting it slide. As she gets more experienced as an agent, she may still think that OOCness is a silly thing to bother with, but she will actually do so.<br><br>Most of the character development that I have planned for Amelia will revolve around her losing some of her fangirlyness and becoming more like a &#39;typical&#39; agent, as well as generally maturing and looking to the future. In contrast, some of the stuff that I have planned for Skeet is going to involve him finding out about his <i>actual</i> past (and then being made to forget it all again, because the DIO can&#39;t really allow that).<br><br>The LOs listed for Amelia are the sort of permanent favourites that she will always come back to. I&#39;m planning on her developing new ones of those as she explores more continua, as well as having &#39;lust-at-first-sight&#39; style crushes during missions. Fortunately Skeet should be capable of restraining her while he tries to find some Anti-Lustin, although I would imagine that after the first few times it becomes necessary, he&#39;ll just take the precaution of dosing her with Anti-Lustin before even stepping through the portal. <br><br>In the story, with regards to Skeet&#39;s navigational skills, I thought that concentrating on trying to reach your destination was detrimental to actually finding it. So if you get lost, but are still trying really hard to find somewhere, you&#39;re still unlikely to find it (quickly at least). <br><br>I had planned on Skeet being quite good at navigation previously, and being able to walk around on &#39;auto-pilot&#39; (got to get through that maze if you work for DIO after all), but that this ability was neuralyzed out of him, to prevent him from accidentally walking back to DIO Central (as I believe that the PPC-issue neuralyzers are capable of removing skills as well as memories). So it isn&#39;t just that he&#39;s been there for a while and never learned the trick of walking around HQ, but that his ability to do so has been deliberately sabotaged. When he&#39;s walking with someone, he can rely on their ability while just carrying on a conversation with them. <br><br>The punctuation outside of speech marks, the use of full stops instead of commas, and other similar problems, is something that I was prepared to blame Google Docs for, certain that those errors weren&#39;t in my original Word document... right up until the point where I checked the original document, and found them there too. So I have no excuse for that, but I&#39;m aware of it now, and I&#39;ll try to do better in the future. <br><br>Skeet referring to Amelia as a &#39;young girl&#39;. In this case, it&#39;s not just the age difference that I was referring to, but the difference in maturity. Skeet has been to university (I don&#39;t think I’ve actually mentioned that before now, but he&#39;s sort of an AU version of me, so he has), and served in the military (something which I imagine could cause you to mature very quickly). So, honestly, yes I think that Skeet would consider Amelia to be a &#39;young girl&#39;, particularly before getting to know her better. <br><br>With regards to Amelia saying &#39;OMG&#39;, I have heard people use it in speech (mostly fanbratty type characters on TV etc. now that I think about it), and it would probably be more typically rendered as &#39;Oh Emm Gee&#39;. However, I thought that PPC Agents were capable of pronouncing such things. An example of this, from the Original Series (Lady of the Fellowship):<br><br><i>&quot;......WTF???&quot; Jay managed to pronounce three consonants without vowels.</i><br><br>I think I also recall something about agents being able to pronounce punctuation, so that they can actually say things like &#39;Evil!Harry&#39; (although I can&#39;t find that reference now, so I may be wrong).<br><br>But I guess that could look a little badficcy, or possibly even worse hypocritical, so maybe it would be better to write it as &#39;Oh Emm Gee&#39; (I still think that Amelia would use expressions like this in her speech, occasionally at least). <br><br>I thought that &#39;ok&#39; was acceptable in writing as either &#39;OK&#39; or &#39;okay&#39;, is that not the case?<br><br>I was basing the background colour of the flash patch on the image, so I will change that to be black. <br><br>With regards to my lack of a beta, that is sort of a bad habit of mine. Whenever I&#39;m in a situation where I&#39;m going to be judged on something, but I don&#39;t have to pass first time, I do like to just do it by myself, to see what my &#39;natural&#39; ability is like. I wasn&#39;t sure whether to do that for this, but decided to in the end, after checking it over myself (where I did pick up some stuff, but clearly not all of it). <br><br>I can assure you that I will always use a beta in the future. <br><br><s>So are you saying that if I start answering newbie questions<i> incorrectly</i>, I won’t have to...</s> <br>I will of course continue to answer any and all questions I see to the best of my ability. <br><br>Hopefully I&#39;ve covered everything, but if there is something you feel I&#39;ve missed, or if one of my explanations is a cause for concern, please let me know.<br></p>

            <p>First, congratulations! Your agents sound like a ton of fun, and your writing sample is entertaining, except for a few mechanical issues. VM says July is going to have some detailed concrit for you, so I don&#39;t want to jump the gun by getting into all of it, but I do want to talk about semicolons.<br><br>Your writing sample is roughly six pages long. As a rule of thumb, that means you get to use about six semicolons, no more, preferably fewer. You used 23. It&#39;s excessive and it&#39;s distracting, especially since many of them are not used correctly. A lot of them would do perfectly well as commas, some of them properly ought to be colons, and the rest could probably be taken out in favor of a period and a new sentence. To give some examples:<br><br>1) &quot;It’d been about three days since Agent Skeet had been on a mission; an unusual circumstance in the PPC.&quot;<br><br>- This one should be a comma. It makes just as much sense, and the end bit of the sentence is a fragment that can&#39;t stand on its own. A semicolon implies that you&#39;re connecting two thoughts that could stand alone but are closely related, but this isn&#39;t a separate thought, it&#39;s a continuation of the one at the beginning.<br><br>2) &quot;The message flickered up on the screen;&quot;<br><br>- You&#39;re introducing a quote here, so this 100% absolutely needs to be a colon. Never use a semicolon to introduce anything. That is the colon&#39;s one and only job.<br><br>3) &quot;She clambered to her feet and began re-gathering everything from the floor around the doorway; Skeet recognised many of the typical newbie gifts; shiny things, sweets and assorted Bleep-products.&quot;<br><br>- The first semicolon there is sitting at what should be the end of a sentence, and I&#39;d say even the end of a paragraph. The first bit is Amelia&#39;s action and should be part of her paragraph. The next bit is Skeet&#39;s action and should be part of his paragraph. Generally speaking, if you change doers, you should change paragraphs.<br><br>- The second semicolon there should be a colon, because you&#39;re introducing a list. The colon is a hard-working but highly specialized little guy who just wants to make a decent living introducing stuff so he can feed his family. Don&#39;t let that flashy up-jumped jackanapes, the semicolon, take that away from him.<br><br>The semicolon is a delicate and tricky little devil, tempting in its versatility, but like most temptations, it should be resisted except on special occasions. I went through a phase of overusing them myself, and have since read a lot about them and learned to feel where they work and where they really aren&#39;t necessary (read: most of the time). I&#39;m happy to talk about it more if you have any questions. {= )<br><br>See also: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Punctuation#On_Semicolons"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Punctuation#On_Semicolons">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Punctuation#On_Semicolons</a></a><br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Firstly, I&#39;m glad you like my agents.<br><br>As for the semicolons, I honestly didn&#39;t realise I&#39;d used that many. I&#39;ll try to keep an eye on them in the future, particularly when it comes to using them wrongly in place of colons. <br><br>Out of interest, where does the &#39;once per page&#39; rule come from? I can&#39;t recall ever hearing that before. Is it a PPC thing, a writing for fiction thing, or just a general English language thing?<br><br>I always thought that colons and semicolons were used to introduce different kinds of lists, so a horizontal list (one made using commas) would be started with a semicolon, but a vertical list (made using bullet points or numbers) would be started with a colon. Having said that, it&#39;s been about 10 years since I last had an actual English lesson, so I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised if some of the stuff I &#39;know&#39; turns out to be incorrect.<br></p>

            <p>Thanks for pointing that out. I doubt very much that I would have spotted that by myself, because I knew what I&#39;d intended to write and so just read that (to the extent that when I first read your post I thought the two sentences were the same, and only managed to track down the difference after noticing they were different lengths). <br><br>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read about an agent trying to concuss himself (which always amused me in the Original Series). I guess that with the advent of Bleeprin and neuralyzers it isn&#39;t really needed anymore, but it seems that Skeet is just a little old-school in that regard.<br></p>

            <p>Over the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been collaborating with my fellow <s>hat-wearers</s> Permission Givers to try and make the whole Getting Permission thing a bit more structured - that is, to help you, as a new writer, determine whether you&#39;re ready to apply for Permission. Because seriously, the only answer we ever give is &#39;Have you been here a month? Well, we don&#39;t really care about that except when we do...&#39;<br><br>(In case you can&#39;t tell, that&#39;s a joke. :P I know a lot of helpful things are said in every &#39;I&#39;m thinking of applying for Permission&#39; thread)<br><br>So! Without further ado, allow me to present the vegetable of our labours (it&#39;s like a fruit, only not so much):<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dExsRGpKMzhPbWVnTlB6TmJVdEttc1E6MQ#gid=0">The PPC Permission Self-Check</a><br><br>This is an entirely voluntary self-check form designed to help you answer the age-old question: Am I Ready To Write PPC? It&#39;s presented as a GoogleDocs survey, but all the questions are optional, and you don&#39;t even have to hit submit. There&#39;s also no slot for your name. ;)<br><br>But the questions are quite hard. They&#39;re thinky questions - lots of big empty boxes for you to write in. :P They cover everything from concrit to characterisation to looking things up on the Wiki - and really, you should be able to at least take a stab at every single question. There are, including bonus questions (they&#39;re the fun ones ;)) and the record-keeping at the end, 44 of the beggars - so it might take you a while.<br><br>But it&#39;ll help. Promise.<br><br>hS<br><br>(It&#39;s already been checked and approved by several PGs, but if anyone can spot any non-deliberate mistakes, or anything that needs to be clarified - please say. ~hS)</p>

            <p>Well, I don&#39;t actually consider myself ready to request Permission, mainly due to a lack of dedication. And I&#39;m not sure how good my &#39;constructive criticism&#39; was for the Royal Fanfiction Academy of Equestria since I didn&#39;t really get into characterizations or anything, but it was still there.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>(Copied verbatim from the wiki for the newbie&#39;s benefit)<br>The PPC Boarder Shipfic Fest is one of the stranger activities that the PPC Board gets up to. It is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, but since newcomers will still probably be inclined to tilt their heads and go &quot;WTF?&quot; at the strangeness, a few words of explanation:<br>We at the PPC do not like to take ourselves too seriously. Therefore, to celebrate the coming of spring and the resurgence of fresh hormones in our young blood--or really just anytime someone feels like starting it--we hold an event in which anyone who wants to writes silly shipfic about various PPC Boarders. Those who do not wish to participate are respected and left out of it. Everyone else is subject to the shippy and often slashy whims of their fellows, with amusing results.<br><br>There are a couple of rules, of course:<br><br>The first, which has been stated but bears repeating, is that anyone who does not want to participate is left out of it.<br>Similarly, if someone is not around to give their assent or dissent, they are left out of it just in case.<br>Second, the rating should stay PG-13 or lower. This is meant to be silly and fun, not squicky.<br>Once somebody starts the shipfic thread, it is traditional to state your willingness to participate if you are willing, and then to call out potential pairings (or more-than-pairings), perhaps along with the grounds (if any) for the &#39;ship. If there is one in particular that strikes your fancy, write it! If someone writes a shipfic with you in it, it is then traditional to retaliate and write one about them.<br>Or you can just up and do whatever you want. *wink wink nudge nudge*<br>----<br>(And now for something small, to get us started, as the actress said to the bishop.)<br>&quot;Wait, what&#39;s this?&quot; July asked, as she was being dragged along by VM.<br>&quot;C&#39;mon! You&#39;ve gotta peruse Dann&#39;s bookshelf! Just be careful not to topple it!&quot; VM exclaimed, running down the hall.<br>&quot;Yeah. No one is allowed to topple his bookshelf. Not even VM.&quot; Data said with a waggle of his eyebrows, which earned him a glare from both of the women.</p>

            <p>VixenMage was typing away at her computer, working on her latest fic, and was so absorbed in her work that she didn’t notice Phobos walk in until he spoke. <br><br>“Hi, Neshomeh said something about you wanting to give me a massage?”<br><br>“Huh? I said I had a <i>message</i> for you.” VM looked round, noticing that her guest seemed to have dressed up for her. <br><br>“Oh... well, that doesn&#39;t sound anywhere near as interesting,” Phobos said, looking disappointed. He was beginning to regret wearing his special break-away tuxedo. <br><br>“Wait, she got message and massage confused? That doesn’t sound like her at all.”<br><br>Phobos thought back to when he’d last seen Neshomeh. “Well, she was kind of ‘busy’ at the time, and her voice was sort of muffled... now that I think about it, it can’t be easy to talk <i>and</i> do that simultaneously.”<br><br>The two Boarders shared a mental image. <br><br>“Well, I really should finish my fic, but it’d be a shame to waste this opportunity,” VM reached out and grabbed some bottles of massage oil that were conveniently close by. “Would you prefer Orange and Lemongrass or Vanilla?”<br><br>“Your choice.” He said, casting off all of his clothing in one swift (and highly practised) motion.<br><br>-----------<br><br>Much later, and after a <i>very</i> thorough massage, the two of them lay on a bed, the scent of vanilla heavy in the air. <br><br>Phobos propped his head up, looking across at VM. In her enthusiasm, she had ended up with quite a lot of the oil on herself. “Wow, words cannot describe how good I feel right now.”<br><br>“Well, when it comes to thanking people, I hear that actions speak <i>much</i> louder than words...”<br></p>

            <p>It had to be a dream<br><br><i>(it wasn’t a dream)</i><br><br>because the last thing she remembered, Neshomeh had been poring over the Wiki, trying once again to cut down the number of pointless pages. Then she was here, in darkness lit only by a faint blue glow.<br><br>“Hello?” Neshomeh called, on the principle that information gathering was a good thing (and right now she felt what almost amounted to a burning <i>need</i> for information, as if it was the entirety of her being). “Is anyone here?”<br><br>There was a long silence, and then a faint reply. “Um… not <i>there</i> exactly, I don’t think… where <i>is</i> here?”<br><br>“I have no idea,” Neshomeh called back, trying to walk towards the voice – but she couldn’t walk. Strangely, though, she was moving anyway; she felt as if she were being jerked from point to point, but at the same time as if she had been at her new position all along. Information gathered, information filed. There was a feeling of constriction in the air (was it air?), as if she’d entered a narrow tunnel, and then a widening, and a flickering blue light ahead, like some kind of sci-fi fairy.<br><br><i>(Hey, hey, come down here, you’ll want to see this.)<br><br>(I’m busy… but okay, just a minute.)</i><br><br>“… hello?” the voice said, and Neshomeh realized with a start that it was coming <i>from</i> the fairy-light. “Who’s there?”<br><br>“… er, my name’s Neshomeh,” Neshomeh replied. “Could you tell me-“<br><br>“Neshomeh!” the voice exclaimed. “No way! It’s JulyFlame – you know, from the Board.”<br><br>“July!” Neshomeh exclaimed in reply, watching the light ahead of her carefully. “Um, why are you a spark of electricity?”<br><br>“I was going to ask you the same question,” July replied wryly. “I only noticed a couple of minutes ago – it’s hard to look down, you know?”<br><br>“Er, yes, definitely,” Neshomeh agreed, although in truth she hadn’t noticed at all. “Where… are we?”<br><br>“Not a clue,” July said. “Last thing I know I was on the Wiki, looking for-“<br><br>“Me too,” Neshomeh cut in grimly. “That doesn’t bode well.”<br><br>“You can’t be thinking of a Wiki-related plot to kidnap us,” July said, “that’s just ridiculous… right?”<br><br><i>(Oh my Bohr! What are </i>those<i>?)<br><br>(I don’t know. Keep watching them.)</i><br><br>“Utterly ridiculous,” Neshomeh agreed – too quickly. “But… do you get the same feeling I do about this place? Like it’s… well, I don’t know. Disturbing.”<br><br>“I keep expecting to see blood when I look round,” July agreed. “It feels like a place where violence happens.”<br><br><i>(Don’t they know they’re on the DAVD page?)<br><br>(I get the feeling they don’t know much.)</i><br><br>“It’s disturbing,” Neshomeh said again, with a tone of finality. “I think we should try and, you know, disperse it.”<br><br>“Oh?” July said, in a tone of cautious agreement. “And how do you suggest we do that?”<br><br>“The same way one always gets rid of bad feelings,” Neshomeh said. “The power of Love!”<br><br>July’s spark flushed a vibrant pink. “Oh, Neshomeh,” she said, “I never knew you cared.”<br><br>“Neither did I,” Neshomeh admitted, “but let’s just go with it.”<br><br><i>(Okay, that’s kind of disgusting.)<br><br>(Yeah… hot, though.)<br><br>(Oh, well, obviously.)</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>Neshomeh/July/the Wiki, just as promised. <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Story36.htm">This may explain a few things</a>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;Um... excuse me.&quot; said a quiet, squeaky voice over the auditorium PA system.  &quot;We&#39;ve experienced a corset malfunction.  Our trained professionals are working on the problem and the show will start shortly.  Thank you.&quot;<br><br>In the auditorium, people went back to talking amongst themselves.<br><br>&quot;Any idea what&#39;s going on?&quot; asked Pieguy.<br><br>&quot;No idea,&quot; replied Maslab.  &quot;But I think Fluttershy just said there was a corset malfunction.  There&#39;s something not right about that.&quot;<br><br>Across the auditorium, in a shady corner, Data and Tray were killing time by taking turns making out with Caddy.<br><br>Doctorlit looked around the room.  &quot;This all seems very familiar, if entirely backward.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No idea what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; said melancholicPoet.<br><br>Doctorlit was about to explain when the lights went out.  A hush fell over the room, with an exception made for the sounds of making out coming from Data, Tray and Caddy.  The darkness and silence dragged on to the point that everyone wondered if a fuse had blown.<br><br>A spotlight sprang to life, fixed center stage on a tall girl with short red hair.  She wore a black mini-kilt, dark red tank-top, and thigh-high boots.  &quot;Thanks for your patience,&quot; she said in that same quiet squeak.  &quot;Now, without further ado...&quot;  Bryn&#39;s lips curled into a grin and her voice changed.  Gone was the gentle shyness.  It was replaced with throaty power.  &quot;We are the Department of Badass and we aren&#39;t here to sing sappy love songs!  We&#39;re here to rock!&quot;<br><br>Her last sentence was punctuated by the sound of drumsticks clicking together.  After four clicks, every light on the stage flared to reveal the entire band.<br><br>The eye was drawn first to the drummer.  Her hair was styled into liberty spikes; each spike dyed red, yellow, or orange.  She wore a black leather vest with red and orange flames embossed on it.  July&#39;s drumsticks flashed across the kit as the song began.<br><br>Near the drums was a pair of guitarists.  They wore matching black jeans.  Their black tee-shirts were tight; one displayed a bee holding up a lighter, while the other sported a sheep with a battleaxe.  Annabee set up the melody, while Himochi played rhythm.<br><br>On the other side of the stage from them was the bassist.  She was on the smallish side, but her red hair had been styled into a mohawk.  She was decked out in, what appeared to be, a single black ribbon that had been wound strategically around her body.  VM was laying down the bass line with a smile on her face.<br><br>Behind VM was a keyboard set-up.  The Boarder behind the keys had all of her hair tucked under a pinstriped fedora, which matched her bikini top, suspenders, and pants.  PitViperOfDoom&#39;s fingers glided across the keys.<br><br>When Bryn began to sing, she was joined by another woman.  This one had her dark hair lightly spiked.  Neshomeh was dressed in tight leather pants and a black corset with red trim.  She added harmony and backup vocals to Bryn&#39;s lead.<br><br>The song was about killing Sues and the crowd was really getting into it.  Nakkel was waving his shirt above his head.  The Irish Samurai was holding up a sign (we&#39;re still not sure where he found it on such short notice) that proclaimed his desire to &quot;have VM&#39;s babies!&quot;  TheScribe had stolen Data away from Tray and Caddy.  The four of them were doing more than just making out in that back corner.<br><br>The song reached the bridge, which gave Annabee and Himochi a chance to play dueling guitars.  They went back and forth, getting faster each time.  It would have gone on, except that July broke in with a drum solo.  <br><br>While all of that was going on, Nesh and Bryn engaged in a little fanservice by kissing and caressing center stage.  They broke the kiss and grinned at the audience before launching back into the song.<br><br>As the song came to an end, the assembled Boarders went wild.  Boxer shorts were thrown on stage, as was Araeph.  She was immediately grabbed by VM and dragged offstage.  A few minutes later, a long black ribbon floated down from the catwalk above the stage.<br><br>PitViper decided that being the keyboardist should be more exciting, so she went crowd surfing.  When she made it back to the stage she was without her bikini top and pants, though she still had her hat and looked very happy.  She put an arm around both Annabee and Himochi and walked them toward the dressing rooms while whispering in their ears.<br><br>Nakkel climbed on stage, still shirtless, and was hauled off by a grinning July for places unknown.  <br><br>Neshomeh gave Bryn a wink and, as they disappeared together backstage, a corset and a tank top were tossed back onstage, to the delight of the crowd.<br><br>The audience, having no one else on stage to watch, turned on itself.  Clothes were discarded as everyone followed the example of Data, Tray, Caddy, and TheScribe.<br><br>------<br><br>Meanwhile, in the sound and light booth.<br><br>&quot;It was a good show,&quot; said Dann from the light board.<br><br>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; agreed Phobos, who had worked the sound.<br><br>There was a sound behind them as Artell&#39;s phone rang.  &quot;Hello?&quot; he said.  &quot;Oh, July.  How&#39;d the...you what?  How much leather?  Less and less all the time?  I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;  He hung up the phone.  &quot;Gotta go guys.  July needs me for...well...you know.&quot;  With that he ran for the door.<br><br>&quot;Have fun, Princess!&quot; called Phobos at the retreating Artell.<br><br>&quot;Very good show,&quot; remarked Dann with a grin.</p>

            <p>&quot;Wow,&quot; Caddy mumbled as he stared at the ceiling in a daze. &quot;I think I lost all sensation in one of my legs there for a moment. Wait... no, it just got tangled up in the sheets. There we go, I got it.&quot;<br><br>There was no response from July, not even a winded &quot;uh huh.&quot; Caddy turned his head towards the other Boarder and saw that she was scribbling something down on a piece of paper. The post-coital wooziness was still strong enough that Caddy couldn&#39;t quite make out what was on the paper from where he was laying.<br><br>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hang on a second,&quot; July replied. She paused, erased something, then rewrote something else. &quot;And... done! Here you go.&quot;<br><br>July passed the paper over to Caddy, who gave it a cursory examination. His eyes grew wider the more he read. &quot;Is this... are you giving me <i>concrit</i>?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I felt there were some areas where you could have used a little improvement,&quot; July replied casually as she stretched out on the bed. &quot;It&#39;s part of what the PPC is about.&quot;<br><br>Caddy was still staring, owl-eyed, at the paper. &quot;For <i>writing</i>, not for what we just did!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, you&#39;d prefer I just stroke your ego?&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Amongst other things, yes.&quot; Caddy set down the paper, folded his arms across his bare chest, and pouted.<br><br>July rolled her eyes. &quot;Tell you what,&quot; she purred as she shifted over next to Caddy. &quot;How about you let me help you improve your skills? Give you some... hands-on instruction, as it were.&quot;<br><br>Caddy&#39;s pout almost immediately vanished. &quot;Yes please.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent. I think we&#39;ll start with some basic exercises.&quot; A smile slowly spread across July&#39;s face. &quot;First off: cunning linguistics.&quot;</p>

Support it like <i>that</i>, and-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, Kit, it would break,&quot; Laburnum said - less patiently now. &quot;Can we just do something, I don&#39;t know, <i>realistic</i>?&quot;<br><br>kitsune106 frowned, looking around the room, taking in the various items of what might best be termed paraphenalia. Most of them were covered in fur. &quot;I don&#39;t think I know that word,&quot; he said worriedly.<br><br><b>Two...</b><br><br>&quot;Oh Da-ann...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mm?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m waiting for you, Dann...&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s nice, dear.&quot; Techno-Dann leant in closer to the computer, frowning at the tangle of code. &quot;Did I forget to close something?&quot; he murmured. &quot;Or maybe...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not wearing any <i>clothes</i> and I&#39;m waiting for you,&quot; Vixenmage went on from behind him. Techno-Dann nodded slightly.<br><br>&quot;Lovely, dear,&quot; he said. Maybe if he ran it in debug mode... no, the problem was somewhere else. Perhaps up here.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m ready and waiting for wild sexing, Dann,&quot; Vixenmage went on, her voice tinged with hopelessness. Techno-Dann frowned.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll be right with you, dear,&quot; he mumbled. Okay, start from the top...<br><br>Behind him came an exasperated sigh, and then the sound of Vixenmage pulling on a silky robe, stepping down from the bed and walking over to put her arms around him. &quot;All right, all right,&quot; she said, looking over his shoulder. &quot;What&#39;ve we got?&quot;<br><br><b>One...</b><br><br>&quot;Yes, and then she puts her hand <i>there</i>, and he pressed a finger to <i>that</i>...&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn sat up from her nap and raised an eyebrow. Huinesoron was standing in front of a blank wall, gesturing strangely with both hands. He was also naked, which was nice, but didn&#39;t make any more sense out of things.<br><br>&quot;And then he moans, and she kisses him... yes, <i>there</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;hS, what in all the worlds are you doing?&quot; Kaitlyn asked, standing up and walking to stand next to him. He glanced over his shoulder at her, taking in her nude form with a glance.<br><br>&quot;Oh, hello, lover. Nice nap?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mm, yes it was,&quot; Kaitlyn agreed. &quot;But you&#39;re avoiding the question.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron frowned, realised his hands were still in the air, and dropped them rapidly to his sides. &quot;Well, I was just... would you believe a &#39;nothing&#39;?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Kaitlyn said flatly. &quot;It <i>looked</i> like you were using magical powers to control people in what might be called intimate ways.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... well, maybe I was.&quot;<br><br>&quot;hS,&quot; Kaitlyn said, &quot;you don&#39;t <i>have</i> magical powers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... yeah, but I might.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shurrup. It&#39;s fun anyway.&quot;<br><br><i>Five rooms. Five beds. And not one of them being used.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>I know I said I wouldn&#39;t. But then the idea struck (and Kaitlyn said I was allowed ;)).<br><br>hS, ze puppetmaster muahaha</p>

            <p>&quot;Wow,&quot; Data remarked, leaning back in his seat. &quot;This train is downright empty, this late at night.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; Maslab replied, glancing away from the window. He immediately blushed. &quot;Oh... er, Data, your... your kilt...&quot;<br><br>He looked up from his comic hoard, twinkling innocently. &quot;Hmm?&quot;<br><br>Maslab coughed, and looked in the opposite direction. &quot;Your kilt is... er, well, your legs are...&quot;<br><br>Data grinned, and glanced down. &quot;Oh, is it? Now, how did <i>that</i> happen? It certainly wasn&#39;t windy today.&quot;<br><br>Still blushing, Maslab shook his head. &quot;No. No, it was not. I... I didn&#39;t know you went Scotsman...&quot;<br><br>The train screeched to a halt, and Data stood up. &quot;Now you do! And, better yet, you know <i>why</i>. But I still have pressing questions!&quot;<br><br>Maslab followed him off the train, towards the hotel. &quot;Such as?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What <i>is</i> under that trenchcoat of yours, hmmm?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;So I was saying, &#39;Please please please don&#39;t make sheep joke! Because I&#39;m Welsh, you know, and we always get sheep jokes made at us and it&#39;s so mean because most Welsh people don&#39;t even <i>own</i> a sheep, and besides it&#39;s not really us who should be getting the sheep jokes, because there&#39;s the Kiwis and the Australians and oopsy I totally forgot about the Scots-&quot;<br><br>Beside her, nakkel twitched. And quivered. &quot;Oh, stop your bleating. I can&#39;t take it anymore!&quot;   <br><br>Instead of stopping, she continued. &quot;Ooh, whoops, heeeheeee, you&#39;re Scottish, aren&#39;t you! Your accent is really obvious and I&#39;m sorry about saying that you do sheep I really didn&#39;t mean it but it&#39;s reaaaaaally tiresome you know when people constantly go &#39;Oh, Himochi, I heard you&#39;re Welsh, have you ever had a sheep before?&#39; and then I go &#39;No! Why would I have ever had a sheep, I&#39;m a girl, and besides, that is just gross and- Mppph!&quot;<br><br>Nakkel had kissed her. Open on the mouth. And was putting his tongue to good use, stopping hers. <br><br>Her legs collapsed under her, but nakkel&#39;s arms were already there, to cradle and keep her from falling.<br><br>&quot;There! That shut you up but good.&quot; He sounded satisfied. For once.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll really stop me because that was a reaally nice kiss but it didn&#39;t really have any staying power for after since it was just a kiss you know and-mmmph!&quot;<br><br>Nakkel kept his mouth there this time.</p>

            <p>Annabee was sitting at her computer, furiously typing away at a mission.  Her hands moving at speeds only accessible by Newbie Ranger Excitement Pink.  <br><br>Her hands moved so fast, in fact, that they blurred.  Then they moved faster and the blur became a double image.  The double image became more and more distinct and grew to cover her whole body.  Her speed increased further.  Smoke started to rise from her poor keyboard.  The double image sharpened even more, until finally it separated from her body entirely.<br><br>When the smoke cleared, there were two Annabees in the room.  They looked at each other for a moment.<br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; said one.  &quot;I must need a break.  I&#39;m beginning to see things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe,&quot; said the other.  &quot;But just because you&#39;re hallucinating doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have some fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I make a good point,&quot; said the first with a grin.<br><br>They started working on getting out of their clothes.<br><br>Within five minutes, the level of energy in that room grew to levels that, if harnessed, could power several large countries.  This author thinks the Annabees put that energy to better use.</p>

She kept stopping to brush her hair out of her face.  &quot;Very well.  I hope you&#39;re ready.

            <p>&quot;This is supposed to be healthy?&quot; Phobos asked. He exhaled, sending a puff of cool breath into the hot, humid room. Rivulets of sweat and condensed water were winding down his face, tracing clean lines down his neck, and from there following down his strong shoulders, and muscled chest, lacing down his arms and belly.<br><br>&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Artell replied.  He tossed some water onto the heater, sending up a great plume of steam. &quot;There&#39;s a saying, you know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is?&quot; Phobos asked, looking disconcerted for a moment. <br><br>&quot;&#39;Jos ei viina, terva tai sauna auta, tauti on kuolemaksi.&#39; If alcohol, tar or sauna won&#39;t cure the disease, it will kill you.&quot; Artell said. <br><br>&quot;I think I would&#39;ve liked the alcohol more.&quot; Phobos looked around the planked room. &quot;Is the nudity really necessary?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s traditional,&quot; Artell explained. <br><br>&quot;It is?&quot; Phobos looked vaguely alarmed.<br><br>&quot;It is.&quot; <br><br>Phobos looked down at the heater, up at the ceiling, and then finally at Artell. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be seducing me or something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, no.&quot; Artell looked distraught at the very idea.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a relief.&quot; Phobos wiped his brow. <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s for later. You shouldn&#39;t be having sex in the sauna. The desexualization of the sauna is what has made sauna culture as it is possible!&quot; <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s perfectly fine with me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, an hour or two from now good with you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure. But what do we now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We beat each other with sticks, of course.&quot;</p>

            <p>The two girls were chatting, on the bed, when suddenly, AnnaBee said, &quot;Wait a second, I&#39;m having a hard time understanding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Pit Viper. &quot;Why is that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t see your lips!&quot;<br><br>Pit Viper turned, so that she was facing AnnaBee completely. &quot;Is this better?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; AnnaBee admitted.

She twisted and turned, and very soon removed the clothes covering her lower body (and then, after a moment of consideration, those covering her upper body as well.) &quot;Is this better?&quot;<br><br>AnnaBee twisted, so that her legs were in front of Pit Viper&#39;s face. &quot;This is much better,&quot; AnnaBee said, into Pit Viper&#39;s lips.<br><br>&quot;Ohhhhhhhhhh, yes, it is.&quot;<br><br>With that, they continued talking.<br><br>-July, fulfilling by request </p>

            <p>(A continuation of last years &quot;A Fistful of Platnium&quot; found here: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=208649;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=208649;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=208649;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board</a></a> )<br><br>Plat strode through the halls of the PPC, for what felt like an age. Peering through the empty corridors, he felt a rushing a dread- and not just in his loins.<br><br>Suddenly, he heard it. A collective disappointed sigh and rolling over. Running like mad, he finally  found it: The Cafeteria. Pushing the door open with the care of a raging rhino, and Plat gasped with horror.<br><br>What Plat saw, made him feel a deep lingering burst of sympathy. The Cafeteria was packed to the brim with naked boarders strewn left and right, and yet, they all sort of looked... mildly downtrodden. <br><br>They were staring at each other (and Plat) with a look of enthusiasm, but ultimately confusion and utter awkwardness about the whole copulating business. Orgies tend to lose steam when no one knows exactly what goes where, but knows vaguely that the things between legs are important in this copulating business.<br><br>The room was silent. Dead Silent as Plat entered. <br><br>A moment of self-conciousness washed over Plat with everyone staring at him and his perfectly muscled body. And then the self-conciousness was taken out back  with a bazooka by his raging man hormones. <br><br>“WHO DID THIS TO YOU?” Plat roared, echoing fiercely in the large open space. “WHO DID THIS TO YOU, THIS... THIS SEXLEXIA.”<br><br>He waited for a moment in silence, before the door he just entered through, creaked open.<br><br>“Oh you~ Ever the hero, aren’t you~?” A low feminine voice crooned, the sound of remarkably high heels tapping out an impatient pattern on the floor. The boarders cowered, as Plat turned to look at the woman in the doorway. <br><br>July grinned wickedly, dressed in naught but a rather impressive black corset, black leather heeled boots, and a fabulous tophat. She tugged on the leash in her hand, pulling a group of cowed boarders into the room- Plat instantly recognizing Caddy, HerrWozzeck, and Makari on the line.<br><br>“YOU FIEND!” Plat shouted, and everyone, save July and Plat, cowered and pulled away from the pair. “How could you do this, July? This is madness!”<br><br>“No dear, this is politics~” She cracks the whip to her side, making the entire room flinch.<br><br>Plat adjusted his sombrero and scowled at the black vixen (not to be confused with the mage one).<br><br>To be... finished in &quot;The Good, The Bad, and the Plat.&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve managed to pile a few crates of Bleeprin together to  barricade myself in this storeroom. I think I have enough food and throwable shiny objects to wait out whatever is going on here. How convenient.<br><br>Everyone seems to be going mad, all jumping on each other and the like. There are sounds coming from somewhere nearby that are nothing short of worrying, and they seem to be getting closer. The others haven&#39;t noticed me so far but I think it&#39;s only a matter of time before they stumble upon me. I found a Neuralyzer on the way here but it&#39;s running low on batteries. I still might be able to squeeze out two or three uses in case I&#39;m discovered.<br><br>I have a small plastic spoon in my possession which I am using to dig a tunnel leading outside. It&#39;s kind of hard to dig though hardwood but I&#39;m not giving up yet: I&#39;ve managed to make a scratch in the floor.<br><br>No sign of any non-shippers yet.

            <p>Completed work on barricade around the door today, managed to fortify the entire thing with a tall triple layered wall. Removed crates blocking the door and built a crude trap above it as to detain anyone who might walk into this storeroom.<br><br>Heard some non-shipping related sounds in the vicinity.

No point in risking myself any further, decided to retreat back to storeroom and reset the traps.<br><br>Exit tunnel is widening. I can now fit a toothpick in the crack I&#39;ve made in the floor.

            <p>And I think it&#39;s a fine concept for a movie. <br>But yes, The Tale of Beren and Luthien would make a good movie, though honestly I was surprised that even the Hobbit got greenlit. I have given up hope for anything from the Silmarillion, though with the Hobbit getting made anything could happen.<br><br>It would be interesting to read the fanfic that would result from such a movie. Sues after Beren? Luthien bashing? <br><br>Also, shouldn&#39;t we be hoping that a Hollywood exec. <i>is</i> a ppc-er/reading this. That would be awesome!</p>

            <p>I guess I&#39;m in the &#39;IT WAS MY CHILDHOOD&#39; camp. The Thorin Oakenshield in my head wasn&#39;t anything like that. Although it looks kickace. <br><br>Ehhhh, Hollywood is the reason we can&#39;t have nice things. They&#39;d cast Kristen Stewart as Luthien or something. And then we&#39;d ALL die of shame. If an indie studio did it, we could enjoy it, but if Hollywood did it, they&#39;d make it all. about. Luthien&#39;s. boobs. -_-<br><br>I didn&#39;t like the LOTR movies much... Though I know they tried... You just can&#39;t get that feeling of <i>mono no aware</i> into a movie. That&#39;s a Japanese phrase that means, more or less, &quot;the pathos of things&quot;... according to Wikipedia, the Fount of Knowledge, &quot;the awareness of impermanence (無常 mujō?), or the transience of things, and a gentle sadness (or wistfulness) at their passing.&quot; It&#39;s a word we don&#39;t have in English, but it&#39;s PERFECT for LoTR...<br><br>And hoo boy. XD Poor Luthien. And Beren would get an even angstier, more tragic backstory than he needs to have... *cough* like Legolas *cough*...</p>

            <p>I accepted long ago that if anything was going to be turned into a<br>Movie it would be fundamentally changed, though not neccesarily for the worse. Film is just a completely different medium, and therefore the feeling is going to change. <br><br>I can understand your opinion, but I like both film and book, book only a little bit more. And I have some faith in Hollywood. They may have messed up transformers completely, but Tolkein is still pretty good.<br><br>And oh god, the more I think about the imaginary ToBaL movie, the more awful fanfic I imagine.

            <p>Miscellaneous Actions Department Constables KF and MFPC were relaxing in their Readiness Chamber following a successful foray into the “Sweeney Todd” penny-dreadful, in which they had banished a stubborn wraith from Mrs Lovett. Emm was busying himself creating a new variant of his Most Extraordinarily Spicy Curry Powder, while Kay polished her scythe with the Oriental Artificer’s latest blade polish – said to create such a fine sheen that the gore slid right off.<br><br>Suddenly, the whirring of the Transfictionally-Activated Computational Engine in the corner of the room was replaced with a harsh [BRRRRRRRRRRRINNNNNGGGG!] as the alarm bell drilled. Kay jumped, almost impaling herself on the scythe blade. “By Jove, that sound is as the Devil’s own scream! Do shut it off, Emm.”<br><br>Emm duly silenced the bell and examined the printout now scrolling up from the automatic typewriter. “My word!” he said, aghast. “It seems some dastardly Sue has managed to infiltrate Great Expectations! She’s attempting to influence poor Pip to wed herself instead of Estella!”<br><br>“The benighted harlot! Why, I’ve a mind to give her a damned good thrashing myself, ladylike or no!” Kay stood. “Very well, Emm, let us prepare to depart. Fetch the Portable Canonical Consistency Diviners; I shall set the coordinates on the Tele-Transportational Aether Sunderer and instruct the Chamaeleonizer as to our appropriate attire.”<br><br>As Emm made sure the PCCDs were properly wound, Kay opened the valves serving the Computational Engine’s aether sunderer and chamaeleonizer (properly Professor Hiram J. Beechworth’s Marvellous Canonically-Attuned Chamaeleonizer) and pulled the appropriate levers. Within just fifteen minutes, the controls were all correctly set, and a final turn of a crank opened an appropriately-sized rend in the Transfictional Aether leading to Satis House, where they were to pose as visiting cleaners.<br><br>“Are we ready, Emm? If so, then let us proceed; by jingo, we’ll expunge this dratted Sue from Dickens’ hallowed pages!”<br><br>“Hear, hear!” Emm picked up the briefcase containing their equipment, and together they boldly stepped forth into the thrilling world of fiction.<br><br>----<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s right, it&#39;s Steampunk!PPC. An AU where the gentlemen are Proper Gentlemen, the ladies are Proper Ladies and the Flowers are... er... Proper Flowers. Where great boilers and furnaces power the mighty machines that help keep the fictional realms safe. Where people say &quot;egad!&quot; and &quot;jolly good!&quot; a lot, and everything has a really complicated name.<br><br>This AU is open to all and, I daresay, sundry. Tally-ho! For Flowers and Canon!</p>

            <p>Constable Doc adjusted his monocle and frowned as the typewriter on the Transfictionally-Activated Computational Device clicked out a reel of parchment.  He leaned over the machine to read as the report slowly appeared.<br><br>When he has read enough, he called out, “Miss Vannie!  We have received yet another crossing-over between <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> and <i>Les Misérables</i>!”<br><br>“That makes three such assignments in under a score of days.”  Constable Vanna Toulouse sighed.  “Though it gladdens me to see that Mr. Hugo’s works are still popular amongst the public, I do long for the uncomplicated days before these o’er-crossings entered into fashion.”<br><br>Constable Doc moved to join her at the equipment pantry.  “I am not certain ‘uncomplicated’ is an adjective which was applicable to our profession at any time.”<br><br>“Truly spoken.”  The constables both bent down to retrieve a large apparatus from the bottom shelf.  “Nonetheless, this Fused-Fiction Disentanglement Device is becoming quite a strain on the nerves, if I do say so.”<br><br>“As well as on the muscles,” Constable Doc huffed as they both strained to lift it.  “But such is the lot of those of us under the Hydraulic Hyacinth.  Her agents aren’t referred to as ‘Various and Sundries’ for no reason, after all.”<br><br>The constables carried the FFDD across the room and lay it before the wall where the Aether would soon be parted to allow entry into the o’er-crossed canonical worlds.  Constable Vanna then walked to the TACD and began to flip a series of numeric dials.<br><br>“May I assume,” asked she, “that Holmes is once again traveling to Paris to consort with revolutionaries, in spite of the impropriety of a well-known British celebrity doing so during a period of social unrest in France?”<br><br>“You certainly may assume so, for it is precisely the case.”<br><br>Constable Vanna tsked and shook her head sadly.  “Well, it falls to us, now.  Shall we on, Mr. Doc?”<br><br>“Certainly, Madam!”<br><br>*   *   *<br><br>In practiced unison, Constable Doc slapped Mr. Holmes across the face with <i>The Sign of Four</i> as Constable Vanna delivered a much softer blow to Monsieur Enjolras with a copy of the Brick.  The mouths of both canonical persons expelled a bright white fog, which mixed together to form a ghostly gentleman in top hat and cane.  The constables nodded to each other before advancing on the author-eidolon.<br><br>“oh i get it were in the steampunk verson and im made out of steam ha ha ha AAAAH”<br><br>The eidolon was easily dissipated by copies of two powerful canons being swung through its being.<br><br>On the topic of powerful canons, however, Monsieur Enjolras was was now raising a caplock rifle to his shoulder, and Mr, Holmes was drawing an anachronistic Webley revolver.<br><br>Each constable drew a small glass ball from a pocket and threw it before one of the canonical men.  The glass shattered, and from within, the mists of the river Lethe rose up to the gentlemens’ faces.  The hands holding their firearms dropped, and their faces displayed a blank expression.<br><br>Constable Vanna pulled two handles out of the bank of interlocked gears which covered the top of the FFDD, and locked them into place on opposite sides of the device.  “Sir, Monsieur, if I could trouble you to place your hands here, and here . . . Thank you kindly!”<br><br>With the canon characters facing each other across two sides of the FFDD, each constable kneeled down next to one of the unoccupied sides and geban to turn the cranks that protruded from those faces of the machine.  The forest of gears began to rotate, all grinding against each other.  Warm steam began to billow out from the base of the FFDD.<br><br>As the steam streamed past the feet of the canons, growing thicker with every crank, the streets of Paris began to fall away, collapsing like the set backgrounds in a stage show.  In spite of the dazed state of his mind, Mr. Holmes detected a sensation of sliding, as though his shoes were running backwards over the rails of a train track.  But after a few moments, the river of steam, the sliding sensation and the mental stupor all had vanished.  Mr. Holmes found himself reclining in the sofa of his apartment at Baker Street, wondering if he had perhaps mismeasured a dose of cocaine.<br><br>*   *   *<br><br>Two weary constables panted as they watched Monsieur Enjolras charge back to the Corinth to rejoin his friends on the barricade.  Constable Doc offered his handkerchief to Constable Vanna to wipe the sweat from her brow before using it on his own.<br><br>“I should say . . . we did well, today.”  Constable Doc said while breathing heavily.  “Not overly much madness today.”<br><br>“No,” agreed Constable Vanna.  “Perhaps next time.  Shall we retire to our Readiness Chamber?”  She held her arm out with her elbow crooked.<br><br>“I certainly think we shall,” her partner replied, linking his elbow with hers.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve always been a fan of the Magical Girl genre, so...<br><br>Magical Plot Protector Agents Anne and Emma~<br><br>Anne was sleeping in her and her partner&#39;s shared room at the Protector&#39;s Garden, an interdimensional fortress that served as the hub of the Organisation, run by the Flower Princesses. She rolled over and had just gotten comfortable when...<br>&quot;DI-IIIIIIIIIING!&quot; squeaked out the small, furry animal sitting on the desk.<br>Anne moaned and turned to face it, when it spoke in an annoyingly high-pitched voice. &quot;Protectors! There&#39;s a disturbance in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha! A Sue-wraith&#39;s possessed Momoko Takamachi and made her a magic-phobic abusive mother!&quot;<br>Emma frowned. &quot;Oh, for crying out loud. Anne, get out of bed,&quot; Anne growled and stood up. &quot;You really should be nicer to CAD. Without him, we wouldn&#39;t be able to find out where the Stus were, or teleport, or anything!&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, thanks for the exposition, Emms. I just wish that the Princesses had thought to make them a little less annoying. How&#39;d you even figure out it&#39;s name, anyways?&quot;<br>&quot;CAD--Canonical Assistance Doodad. Where&#39;re the transformation thingies?&quot; asked Emma. Anne grabbed a pair of small, black discs, each with a green cactus engraved on the front, and tossed one of them to Emma. The two girls said in unison, &quot;Magical Guardians, Canon Protection Powers, Set Up!&quot; In a flash of light, the two were dressed in black, frilly dresses. The black discs were now on chokers, and the two girls looked, well, like stereotypical Mahou Shoujo whose outfits had been dipped in black paint. The large gun and sword that Anne and Emma (respectively) were holding looked somewhat less stereotypical. Emma grinned. &quot;OK, CAD! Open the portal!&quot; <br>&quot;Why do you have to be so cheerful about this?&quot; muttered Anne.<br>CAD started to glow brightly, and within moments the glow had expanded into a bright-blue circle, with a slightly darker spot in the middle where the animal floated. Anne and Emma held their weapons carefully, and walked into the fic.</p>

            <p>The two Magical Girls hid behind a couch while Emma recorded charges. &quot;OK, we&#39;re ready to go! CAD, set up the Wraith Extraction Spell!&quot; she chirped. <br><br>CAD nodded in assent, and opnede its mouth, reciting at high speed:<br>&quot;MynameisTakamachiNanohaIwassupposedtobeanordinarythirdgraderbutasmallincidenthappened--&quot; <br>As CAD recited the opening narration of the anime, glowing words began to flow out of his mouth. They quickly formed a net around the two canons, though Nanoha&#39;s was considerably more comfortable-looking than Momoko&#39;s bonds. <br><br>The two girls jumped up and yelled, &quot;Sue-wraith! For the crimes of cruelty against the English language, messing up the relationships between Canon Characters, and almost replacing Momoko Takamachi, in the name of the Protectors, we will exorcise you!&quot; <br><br>They struck poses in front the two canons. Momoko had just enough time to look confused before the canon recitation forced the Wraith out of her. &quot;i dont get it shouldnt I be mahou shoujo themed t--&quot; *BANG!* <br><br>Anne blew the smoke away from her gun. &quot;I don&#39;t get why they think that we&#39;ll let them monologue--we don&#39;t really care why they&#39;re doing this.&quot; Emma shrugged as Momoko and Nanoha woke up. <br>&quot;Ugh--what happened?&quot; asked Momoko.<br>Emma looked at CAD. &quot;Would you mind?&quot; The small animal nodded and floated over to the two canons. Its eyes glowed for a moment, before flashing brightly. <br>&quot;All done!&quot; it squeaked. <br>Anne sighed. &quot;Fi-nally. That took entirely too long. Just open the portal.&quot; CAD looked less than happy about her appreciation of it, but quickly opened the portal again. As they stepped back into their room, Emma turned back to the still-floating animal. <br>&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to come down?&quot; she asked. CAD seemed to give the impression of a smirk towards Anne, before squeaking:<br><br>&quot;DI-IIIIIIIIIIIIIING! Protectors! There&#39;s a disturbance in Puella Magi Madoka Magica! A Gary Stu is trying to set himself up as a love interest for Mami!&quot;<br><br>Anne groaned and buried her face in her pillow.</p>

            <p>The follow is the logical progression (using the HQ definition of &#39;logic&#39;) of me reading Pieguy and Huinesoron&#39;s steampunk pieces, followed by AnnaBee&#39;s Pirates of the Plot Continuum. <br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>Constable Skeetle had just reached the most delicate operation in the servicing of his weapon, the magnificent Webley and Stronginthearm  Mark VII ‘Widowmaker’ (with, of course Dr Schadenfreude’s patented Proximity Deterrent). The table in front of him was covered in parts and tools, some of which could only exist in the slightly more... <i>relaxed</i> reality of HQ.<br><br>Being brought up as a keen believer in the Daemonic Manifestations of the Triumvirate of Distraction, Misfortune and Comedic Timing (that recent fashion saw fit to pervert into a single entity colloquially known as the Ironic Overpower), he looked around for anything which could distract him, noting that his partner had still not arisen (who could be <i>very</i> distracting when she put her mind to it), and that the alarm on the Computational Engine in their shared Readiness Chamber was set to silent.<br><br>Skeetle made the required feint attempts at locating the component, thereby offering up a small sacrifice of his time as a gift just in case any of the Triumvirate may happen to be watching (the hand gestures of warding preferred by the devotees of the IO were nothing more than idle superstition to his mind). <br><br>[DRRRIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG-INGING-ING—ING]<br><br>As the last echoes faded away, Skeetle was acutely aware of two things. The first was that the volume control of their Computational Engine was now in the upright and locked position, and the second was that the resonant frequency of the bell was exactly that which would cause the Emulsific Compensator to shatter. <br><br>Some days, even the most careful observations of the required rituals left you with egg (or in this specific case, viscous blue fluid) on your face. <br><br>The noise had been loud enough to wake the dead, literally, as it turned out. Skeetle could hear the sounds of his companion moving around in her room, as he turned the control wheel of the Engine to the ‘accept’ position. <br><br>Various mechanical sounds, clicks, clacks and hisses, started emanating from the Computational Engine as the automatic keyboard began typing up the mission parameters. Other aspects of the machinery activated on cue, including the recently purchased Bugatti Self-Contained Tea Production Automaton.<br><br>The Engineer from the Department of Applied Technical Creativity had successfully integrated it with the Computational Engine the previous night, and now Skeetle would be automatically served with a cup of the finest tea prior to every mission. The Constable was a firm believer that no Gentleman Adventurer should ever have to combat the vicious multitude of the forces of badfic without first having imbibed a suitable draught, and now he wouldn’t even have to brew it himself.  <br><br>A mere 8 seconds after activation, the patented Quad-Stack Supercharged Overpressure Boiler had delivered a stream of hot liquid into Skeetle’s waiting cup. With much trepidation, he slowly brought the steaming hot drink to his lips. It was time to find out if that reviewer in the latest TechnoTeapot  serialisation actually knew what they were talking about.<br><br>Best. Purchase. Ever.<br><br>He was still standing in the middle of the RC, with an expression of absolute bliss on his face, when his partner walked out of her sleeping chamber. The sight of her caused his smile to turn up by a couple of notches.<br><br>“Vy must my zl<i>uuuu</i>mber be dezturbed?”<br><br>She was wearing a corset and leather trousers, the black of her clothing emphasising the paleness of her skin. Her hair, usually intricately braided, hung loose. <br><br>Skeet wandered over to the output array, cup of tea still in hand, and looked at the roll of parchment that was spilling out into a bucket. The report was clearly extensive; a couple of feet worth of printing had already collected, with more still being printed. Usually the reports generated by the Department of Expeditionary Reconnaissance were only several inches at most. <br><br> “Sky-pirates of teh Caribbean.” Skeetle read out the title of the fic they’d be going into. <br><br>“Teh?”<br><br>“Apparently. Also: Sky-pirates. Despite the fact that this abomination of an amateur literary work is set in the year of Our Lord 1665, fully two centuries and more prior to Messrs Wright and Wright perfecting their design for an effective and efficient aeronautical engine-“<br><br>“Yez, yez, I am fully avare of zhat, zame az hyu. Vot of ze mission itzelf?”<br><br>Skeetle began scanning the document printed out so far, giving his partner the highlights. “Um... according to this, there’s a whole armada of Extra-Canonical pirate ships, which can fly naturally, virtually every EC in there is a Sue or Stu, with Improbability Quotients up in the sixties at minimum, so a severe danger of Total Personality Transfer for the most lusted after canonical characters... oh...”<br><br>“Vot?”<br><br>“It seems that most of the ships have a version of the main canons. Reconnaissance think it most likely to be a collaborative effort, with each respective author lacking the capacity to share any of their LOs.” <br><br>“Zoundz like hard vurk, I vill be vanting zumtink tzu perk me up a leetle, bevore ve head in.” She sashayed into the kitchenette off the main room, taking a vial out from the prototype Chilled Organ Storage Unit that Medical may or may not know they were missing.  <br><br>Skeetle’s continued assessment of the fic was interrupted by the sound of tortured metal and the grinding of gears. The typewriter stopped moving, one arm frozen in place halfway to the page. <br><br>While he was no Engineer or Armourer from DATC, Skeetle had grown used to the idiosyncrasies of their device, and cast his eye over the engine, noting which parts were locked solid, which quivered in their mountings, and which of the multitude of gauges had needles approaching the red.  <br><br>“Pass me the... number seven, left handed, adjustable correction wrench, would you?”<br><br>Liza plucked the requested tool from its rack, her lips stained a dark red from drinking, and handed the high precision wrench to her partner. He sagged slightly under the weight, but quickly set about calibrating it. Spinning the dials at the business end until he was satisfied with the shape and weight distribution, Skeetle then stepped up to the malfunctioning device and, in a move that would have shocked and appalled the Oriental Artificer, rapped it smartly on its side (the Oriental Artificer, the same as any other traditionalist when it came to the fine art of percussive maintenance, would never <i>dream</i> of using the number seven for anything other than an overhead, vertical strike to a piece of offending machinery). <br><br>With a shudder and the hiss of venting steam, the Computational Engine started up again, almost immediately filling the small room with an unbearable racket.<br><br>[DRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNG]<br><br>[RATattaTATattaTATattaTATattaTATattaTAT]<br><br>[eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee]<br><br>The bell, rattle and whistle were all going, and as Skeetle once more turned the wheel to ‘accept’ he realised why the mission brief was so long. It wasn’t <i>their mission</i>, but rather an ‘All Officers’ alert. Maybe the integration of the Automaton hadn’t been totally successful, it made a damn good cup of tea, but had possibly affected the settings of the main Engine. Unless and until it landed him in hot water with the Portentuous Council of Transnatural Directors, Skeetle would consider that to be a fair trade-off.<br><br>The mission brief finished printing, and Skeetle scanned through the final section, detailing the specific request for assistance and the plan that the first Constables in the field had put together. <br><br>Alizabeth had finished her drink, gaining a bit of colour to her skin tone, and was rummaging through their shared weapons’ locker. <br><br>“Vot iz ze mission zhen?”<br><br>“It’s worse than I first thought! Not only do we have a veritable army of Sues, sorry, that should be ‘navy’, to deal with, and technology contamination, but the <i>entire world</i> is one huge Locational Continuity Error! The reason everyone uses airships is that the land has broken up into a series of ‘floating islands’.”<br><br>“Vy iz zat?”<br><br>Skeetle spoke slowly, at first trying to comprehend what he was reading, before his brain shut down all non-essential features to preserve itself. The exquisite tea was also a remarkably good coping mechanism. “According to Reconnaissance... uh... in the backstory of the fic... the world... exploded. Thus leading to the need for airships.”<br><br>“Ze Vurld exploded?”<br><br>“Yes, according to the Explorer for ‘no adequately explained reason’.”<br><br>The female Constable had finished arming herself, a pair of duelling pistols and a rapier were visible, and she’d have a couple of smaller blades hidden somewhere. Skeetle’s quad-barrelled repeating pistol and a more traditional cutlass were laid out on the table for him.  <br><br>“Zo, vot iz zee plan, und vere do ve fit in to eet?”<br><br>Skeetle finished reading the mission briefing. “The plan calls for a group of Constables to take over one of the EC pirate ships, then launch it into the middle of a large, and rather lacklustre, ‘naval’ battle. Apparently the Phlostigon Department are working in conjunction with the Department for Technical Creativity to rig up a ‘large exothermic reaction generator’ that will be mounted on our captured vessel, and should wipe out all of the Technological Contaminations. Obviously, prior to that, teams are going to sent in to recover any canonical characters from the various ships, which is mostly where we’re going to come in.” <br><br>“Zho, ve are to be pirates zhen?”<br><br>“Actually my dear, the plan calls for us to chamaelenify ourselves as members of the ‘Royal Air Navy’, and why that wouldn’t be the Royal Air Force I don’t know, as the first part of the mission is to capture a pirate vessel, and we do have to keep as canonical as possible.” He began to work on the appearance altering device, calling up the default uniform for Royal Navy mariners. <br><br>Alizabeth strode forward and jabbed a finger into her partner’s chest, using her deceptively powerful strength to force him away from the intricate brasswork controls. <br><br>“No,” She announced. “I don’t like zee uniformz, ve vill be pirates.”<br><br>Skeetle opened his mouth to raise further objectives, but she cut him off before he had a chance to utter a single syllable. <br><br>“Pirates fight each odder all zee time, ve vill be perfectly canonical.”<br><br>“I still think that we should-“<br><br>Alizabeth’s hair streamed out behind her, blowing in a non-existent breeze, and her irises turned from grey to blood red. Shadows flickered across her face, as the lights within the RC flared and dimmed, and Skeetle’s flesh was covered in goosebumps due to the rapid  temperature drop. All in all, it was an unnerving display, even for a seasoned Constable of the Transfictional Canonical Defence Authority. <br><br>“Alright, my darling: pirates it is.”<br><br>“Vot harre hyu vaitink vor zhen?” It had often been remarked upon in the past that Alizabeth’s accent grew stronger the more she drew on her power. <br><br><i>Well, my psychotic companion to move out of the way of the control column that</i> she <i>never bothered to learn to use, but there’s probably a more diplomatic way of putting that,</i> thought Skeetle. He took on an apologetic tone, well aware of the finger stabbing just over his heart. “Oh, well, it’s nothing of course, but you are rather pinning me to the wall here, and I can’t quite seem to reach the controls from all the way back here.”<br><br>“Zorry.”<br><br>Skeetle added greatcoats to both of their ensembles, and selected a tricorn hat for himself. With their disguises set, and the appropriate weapons and equipment gathered, they powered up the Aetheric Sunderer and prepared to enter the Literary Realms once more. <br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&#39;Sky-pirates of teh Caribbean&#39; does not, to my knowledge, actually exist. Although I must admit that I haven&#39;t gone looking for it, just in case I do manage to find it. <br><br>If my writing about it <i>causes</i> it to exist, as the result of some sort of quantum tunneling effect or other equally bizarre means, then I apologise in advance to anyone who encounters it.  </p>

            <p>The great brass pistons hissed with escaping steam, and the heavy riveted form of the door slid upwards to reveal the office beyond. Behind a fine mahogany desk stood a device of the most marvellous intricacy: a well-wrought tree of brass and leather, with leaves of pure gold leaf. Were one not a fully-authorised Constable of the Department of Locational Continuity Preservation (colloquially referred to as the Phlostigon Department, due to their conviction that every problem can best be solved by the explosive liberation of said element from one&#39;s target), one might be tempted to call it a work of art. It was not.<br><br>At the heart of the tangled branches, a burst of steam was expelled, and the fronds started to move. The coppery glow of the etheric transduction mechanism flared into existence, the trunk sparked with magneto-electanic force, and a voice spoke from some undefined source.<br><br><i>Ah, my Constables. Pray, enter, and be seated. Let not your overwhelming incompetence force us to abandon common politeness.</i><br><br>Constables Davillo and Serenity entered cautiously, flinching as the grand entrance sealed itself behind them. They took their seats in silence, aware of their transnaturally animated superior&#39;s gaze.<br><br><i>Excellent. Would you care for tea? I believe Doctor Creator d&#39;Article has repaired the Magnetonic Pressure Oven, so there should be no further &#39;incidents&#39;. No? A pity. Now then.

I do.&quot;<br><br><i>According to Doctor D&#39;Article, what you have succeeded in doing is fundamentally impossible. It defies all the laws governing ethereal beings, not to mention magneto-electanics.</i><br><br>&quot;With your permission, Sir Mallon, it can hardly be impossible,&quot; Constable Serenity (vampire of the Old School, Countess of Transprussia, at least in her own world) spoke up. &quot;He has, after all, achieved it.&quot; She ran a finger over the black leather of her corset. &quot;Almost sent me to my grave again, indeed.&quot;<br><br><i>And we will come to that at a later time,</i> the brass Sir Mallon promised. <i>Constable Davillo, you are a severe danger to all those around you.

I swear I had a list on my FF.net account...<br>Well, right now, it&#39;s mostly Hetalia and Vocaloid, but I also dip into PJO (and Rick Riordan&#39;s other stuff), 39 Clues, Scandinavia and the World, Order of the Stick, Narnia, Inkheart, Hunger Games, stuff like that.

            <p>They met at the crossing of corridors.<br><br>The woman&#39;s arms were crossed. She didn&#39;t look best pleased, and tired. The man next to her jittered. And jittered. And jittered some more. <br><br>The man standing facing her looked similar, albeit wearing a fedora. The man standing beside him was not quite as jittery. <br><br>&quot;Okay. So. That was an embarrassing mistake,&quot; the man in the fedora said. <br><br>&quot;Yes. It was,&quot; the woman replied. <br><br>&quot;And it serves me right for not going into the right room,&quot; the man in the fedora continued.<br><br>&quot;Yes. It does.&quot; The woman tapped her foot. <br><br>&quot;Though, to be fair, it&#39;s not my fault that the rooms were labelled with first names.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Maybe.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Well, they&#39;re both named David! And it took you some time before you actually admitted anything yourself.&quot; <br><br>The woman didn&#39;t reply to that. Instead, she said, &quot;I just want my husband back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And I want my boyfriend back.&quot;<br><br>They crossed the corridor, until they were standing next to their appropriate Davids. <br><br>&quot;Data!&quot; The jittery one promptly glomped his correct partner, and began nibbling on Data&#39;s ear.<br><br>The other David looked at that, and looked back at his own correct partner. &quot;Can I do that?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not right now.&quot; She looked at Data. &quot;Does he normally vibrate that much?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aaaaaall the time. There&#39;s a secret stash of caffeine pills and energy drinks somewhere, I swear.&quot; Data answered. &quot;And does he really spend that much time monologuing and gesticulating at empty air?&quot;<br><br>&quot;All the time.&quot; She eyed her David critically. &quot;He didn&#39;t any of those, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Probably not?&quot; Was Data&#39;s best guess.<br><br>Her David only grinned, in as mysterious a manner as one can manage when one is grinning. <br><br>She sighed. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll find out later if he starts creating rocket fuel in the kitchen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why would it be rocket fuel?&quot; Her David said. &quot;That is a <i>great</i> idea, though.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Ooh, can I help?&quot; Asked the other David.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t see why n-&quot;<br><br>This was answered in unison. &quot;No!&quot; </p>

            <p>Team Nevermind- I like this type of team up, a bunch of people who go into something with no (or in some cases, BAD) ideas of what they are doing. Makes for a good read/watch in stuff.  <br><br>I liked how the piece began, the random agents mulling about in the halls, looking at a posting board, and the different departments. Really sets the scene for the PPC being a big social hub, which is an idea I immensely like.<br><br>Story Four- D:D:D:D:D SLENDERMAN!?!? D:D:D:D:<br><br>... Anyway, the bar is a very good place to meet, especially for a rowdy type of group. It&#39;s good to see Gall again, and Suicide too! The team that slays together, stays together, right? I&#39;m sure their victory celebrations will be quite a party!<br><br>Story One- Agent!July is, as she usually is, amusing to read. No messing around with sneaking or theatrics, just good ol&#39; strongarming into playing a violent sport! It&#39;s definently fun to see all the new and old faces.<br><br><br>One team has no idea what they signed up for, one was mostly corraled against their will, another is a band of rowdy warrior types, and the last is one is 60% over eager, and 40% along for the ride. Quite the difference is recruitment methods and types of teams. I can&#39;t wait for it to start! :D<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>For the record, my involvement in the Team Nevermind story was actually pretty minimal. I nudged some of Ilraen&#39;s and Nume&#39;s lines a bit, but beyond that it&#39;s all Phobos&#39; writing.<br><br>I was thoroughly involved with Team Blast Hardcheese, and yeah, that is the name—I&#39;m told it&#39;s a reference to an MST3K episode, and is reputedly the most stereotypically manly name possible in the English language. Not my first choice, but it&#39;s grown on me. It fits the group of characters pretty well. *g*<br><br>We all basically came up with the framework for the story together, and the idea was for everyone to fill in bits for their characters and I&#39;d smooth it out and give it an editing polish. It mostly went to plan, but I came up against the deadline and didn&#39;t have as much to work with for Noir and Saline, and PoorCynic helped me stop panicking and we put together the ending at the last minute. So, that&#39;s why some folks got more screen time than others. Given a bajillion more hours and no scheduling conflicts, I&#39;d have liked to get all the characters interacting with each other, but so it goes.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I admit that much of my writing in this story was rushed.  That may be the reason for the lack of emotion in the lines.  This is especially prevalent in the section where Barid, Brightbeard, and Kur&#39;nak join.  I didn&#39;t have the time or energy to devote to fleshing it out, if I was to get it in before the deadline.<br><br>I am, at least, glad that the characters come through.  I devoted as much work to Ilraen as was humanly possible, being that I am borrowing him.  I could say the same about Earwig but, honestly, he is my character, and usually being borrowed by Nesh.<br><br>I will have to go over this again at some point in the future to make it better.  It will take more time than I have at the moment, but it will get done eventually.<br><br>Thank you, hS and Ms Ryan, for your time.</p>

            <p>It does tend to go turn and turnabout - as she said, Earwig was brilliant at first but fell flat towards the end (that &#39;Oh by the way random people please join&#39; line in particular), while the last section was sparkling in places, and the weaker places were masked by the non-human nature of it.

            <p>I don&#39;t really write fanfiction for anything, but the works I enjoy are numerous. I like a lot of Anime/Manga, and most works by Square Enix end up in my games collection (which is numerous). I am also a big fan of the webcomic Homestuck, but there&#39;s a lot of other stuff besides that. Like Fire Emblem, and Hitchhiker&#39;(?)s Guide To The Galaxy, And, And, And, Andandandand...</p>

            <p>Welcome and hello!<br><br>Because I&#39;m terrible at coming up with gifts, I instead dispense advice: If you haven&#39;t already, you should check out our wiki. Especially the guides and FAQs. They&#39;ll give you a pretty good idea what we&#39;re about. Better than TvTropes, at least, which seems to be where most of the new people are coming from. Also, mocking is (in my case, at least) good-natured, and directly proportional to the amount of Otakuese used in my presence.<br><br>Now that that&#39;s out of the way, what&#39;re some of your fandoms? (And, if you&#39;re comfortable with answering it, what&#39;re your preferred pronouns?)</p>

            <p>Ooh, chocolate! <br><br>Okay. Question: What does the &quot;K&quot; rating on the claimed/unclaimed badfic lists on the wiki mean? I&#39;m English, so I don&#39;t know much about American ratings. I&#39;m assuming it means something like &quot;Kiddie&quot;.</p>

            <p>@Data: Thanks for the welcome! I&#39;ve already been &#39;round the wiki! But thanks for trying to give some advice! As for the gifts problem, why not try giving out bumper stickers?<br><br>Moving on to gender and fandoms: I&#39;m a he. I didn&#39;t realize that I hadn&#39;t actually referred to myself as such! Fandom-Wise, I don&#39;t actually write any fanfiction, and the list of stuff I like is huge, but Homestuck and a lot of Square-Enix stuff is high on the list, so I guess you couod say those :P!<br><br>(P.S: I had actually found out about the ratings just before you posted, but thanks anyway :D)</p>

And apparently, Homulilly speaks the Black Speech of Mordor. Interesting. <br><br>Madoka ran to Kyubey and they both started walking further into the broken house, the walls fading slowly and turning into black-purple glitter which resembled a galaxy, as they went further there were also red spider lilies on the wall.<br>Suddenly there was a wall in front of them. Kyubey jumped on Madoka&#39;s shoulder and said: &quot;Be careful Madoka, I don&#39;t want you to die until you&#39;ve become a Puella Magi and until you&#39;ve become a witch.&quot;<br>Madoka looked hatefully at him and said: &quot;I really don&#39;t understand how you can be so horrible&quot; and cried which Kyubey ignored, joyfully waiting for Madoka to contract with him, destroying Homulilly and becoming a witch herself.<br>He would not tell her that Homulilly was the most powerful witch, which he had ever seen which made him think that Akemi Homura was actually more powerful than Madoka would ever be as a Puella Magi.<br>They entered Homulilly&#39;s barrier and were in a place that looked like space though they were in fact caught in an hour glass that would probably lead them to Homulilly herself.<br>Everywhere were Homulilly&#39;s familiars which resembled a red spider lily but with pink hair and a dress that resembled Madoka&#39;s transformation as a Puella Magi.<br>They familiars weren&#39;t doing anything but staring angrily at Kyubey as they walked through the labyrinth, which Homulilly had built.<br>As the Hour glass became more tight, Kyubey had to walk himself so that Madoka could robe on her knees.<br>Translated: But more to go home broke as race Kyubey Madoc, the wall disappears, and we cross the wall tattoo is red, purple glow of the galaxy and black seems to be slowly changing.<br>It was a wall in front of them at once.

            <p>From &quot;Echoes of the Narbeleth&quot;.<br><br>Original:<br><br>It has been long said that for each race there is a most beautiful maiden. For the dwarves, it is Pegeli of Moria (alas, the tragedy of her death; Dwarf maidens are hard to come by). For Man it is Rowan of the White City. For hobbits, it is Hopin of The Shire (name after a rare herb that grew there). For Wizards, it is Gwendelle the Silver who passed away into the West thus long ago. For Elves, it is Adariel of Lakewood.<br><br>Although beautiful on the outside, it can&#39;t be guaranteed that they are beautiful on the inside. This is true in the cases of Pegeli, and Rowan. Maybe true for Gwendelle, a load of rubbish for Hopin (who, as hobbits go, is extremely carefree). But for Adariel of Lakewood…<br><br>Whispers pass among Elven ears like the breeze that swirls the leaves. Adariel of Lakewood, the fairest of the fair. But alas. The coldest heart of Elf lore. Never had anybody seen her smile. Never had anybody seen her laugh. Never had anybody seen her cry.<br><br>Adariel the Elven Princess of Lakewood was as cold as ice, as emotionless as glass. Nobody passed through Lakewood without caution. Prisoners brought in front of Adariel were never seen again.<br><br>English - Spanish - Norwegian - Polish - Norwegian - Spanish - English:<br><br>It is great what is said, then, in each of the races they are the most beautiful girl. The dwarfs, there is completely different of moriah Pegeli (moan, tragedy death; krasnolud virgins it is difficult to manage). The man is rowan white city.<br>In the county of hobbits Hopin (name of rare grasses, which keeps on growing).  <br>But from Adariel 6996... Szepcze transferred between the ships of the navy or ships of war or ears Élficas that can touch the sheets. Adariel with 6996, as well as in the shape of green &#39; show.

He never saw that the screams. <br>The ships of war and ship Princess ships of war or Élficas Adariel 6996 it was cold as the ice, so without emotion, as well as for example, glass.

            <p>Okay. Deep breath. This has been a long time in the works (since the Christmas Party over on the Other Board, give or take), but here it finally is.

Given that I emailed about 26 people the Message, I&#39;m hoping for at least a few more. Again, if you never received the Message (and asked to), leave your email address and I&#39;ll send it over. Saying you never got it without leaving an email address is less than helpful, certain people. :P<br><br>Final note: this story is set Right Now, so the 9th May 2012 HST. The other two parts will be set Right Two Weeks From Now. And no, the events of Swansong will not be made public knowledge.

            <p>I&#39;m holding off on a full response regarding the actual content of your piece (the plot, the characterization, whether I liked it, et...il I read the final parts. However, there were two technical issues I wanted to point out.<br><br><i>&quot;... Do we have any Gremlin agents, do you know?”</i><br>Are you referring to the creature of military folklore that would sabotage machinery or the specific PPC agent with that name? If it is the former (which I assume to be the case,) then the word &#39;gremlin&#39; should not be capitalized.<br><br>You repeated the phrase &#39;out of the blue&#39; twice in a very short amount of time. It starts in the paragraph that begins with <i>&quot;Nita blinked&quot;</i> and then repeats in the following section.<br><br>I await the remaining parts with much curiosity.</p>

As does Morgan&#39;s (she seems to react with getting drunk) as does July&#39;s (&quot;Oh god where is the neuralyzer?&quot;) as does Denny&#39;s. (Denny&#39;s opinion, incidentally, is that this doesn&#39;t matter, if you&#39;re freaking out and breaking things and wrecking HQ, since because of this you only deserve utmost SCORN because he and his crew have to go and <i>repair</i> that.)<br><br>To the people wigging out who think that hS is trying to control the PPC: No, he&#39;s not. hS cringed when I called him &#39;Boss&#39;, even jokingly. (He probably even twitched just reading that line, knowing what I do of him.)<br><br>Believe me when I say that hS does not want control of the PPC. If you want to see how he would react to the thought, you are welcome to follow him around and call him &#39;O Glorious Leader&#39; in all of your posts in reply to him. The result will be that he will <i>run away in fear</i>. And not come back for months. He has done it before, he will do it again if he thinks it will help. hS has about as much desire to be a leader as a sponge does. (A hint, hS: It does not help.)<br><br>This is a July reminder, to remind people that you should <i>use your brains</i>. If you are not using your brains, go and apologize to one another right now. Including to hS. He should not be held accountable for you not thinking for yourself (even if we told him this would happen). <br><br>This is a serious examination of meta in the PPC from a different viewpoint. What you shouldn&#39;t be getting from this is &#39;ohgodohnonowIhavetobeseriousandnaileverythingdownjustlikehedidohno&#39; but &#39;Okay, so what? That was a neat story. Now, I wonder how <i>my</i> characters would think about this? Would they have the same reaction? What are <i>their</i> thoughts on how the PPC runs on a meta level? Do they even think there is one?&#39;<br><br>-July, with the Cluebat which has the <i><b>Nails of Knowledge</b></i> embedded in it this time</p>

            <p>but I think July may be right.<br><br>Not everyone&#39;s going to be following the same train of thought as you in this, so they may well come to the conclusion that Peter&#39;s right. It really doesn&#39;t make it very clear at all that he&#39;s manipulated/wrong.

            <p>I&#39;m going to hold my overall reaction for now, much as Phobos is doing, but I do have some writerly writing comments:<br><br>I think this could be improved by giving it some more space to breathe. Everything seems to escalate really quickly, and I don&#39;t always feel that it&#39;s justified. Peter in particular seems happy to go leaping to conclusions whether he&#39;s had time to build a foundation for them or not. I could forgive him for this, given his clear mental instability later, but he seems to be right a bit too often:<br><br>- He&#39;s quick to suspect the Board is actually controlling people (this is the entire premise of the trilogy, AFAIK);<br><br>- His first guess when Nita starts acting strangely is that she was drugged (she has been);<br><br>- He doesn&#39;t take long to assume that there&#39;s some connection between the Board incident and the drug-dealing robot (granted, I don&#39;t know 100% that there is, but I&#39;d be surprised if there isn&#39;t).<br><br>In the end, I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;m supposed to be feeling suspense about these things or not. There&#39;s certainly a mystery here for the characters, but they don&#39;t stay mystified very long.<br><br>The ending also happens really quickly and leaves me wondering how to feel. Suddenly Peter has lost his mind, we go from reading his note to seeing the felled Flowers onscreen in just a few short lines, and neither Justin nor Nita seems to have an emotional reaction to what they&#39;re seeing. Justin&#39;s reactions are explicitly &quot;emotionless,&quot; &quot;monotone,&quot; &quot;hollow,&quot; and &quot;flat,&quot; and the most we get from Nita is widened eyes. I&#39;m experiencing the event at a double-remove myself—I&#39;m watching the characters watch it—and the effect of what should be a horrible tragedy is severely blunted.<br><br>I would have liked a lot more build-up, especially for the final scene. Seeing Justin and Peter look through the records of previous incidents, being with Peter as his mind begins to fray but (presumably) holding it together as best he can, would have helped me appreciate his final breach with sanity.<br><br>I did enjoy everything leading up to the party, though. The tone is much lighter at first, and Justin at least remains skeptical of the whole &quot;PPC Board&quot; thing even as he does his best to contain the situation as he sees it. The whole concept of putting a narrative to those silly shenanigans is fun—we get to see how the DIO agents involved felt about it as it was happening, and it&#39;s a nice contrast to our own perspective: we take the Board and posting on it for granted; they don&#39;t.<br><br>Of course, <a href="http://jenni-robinson.dreamwidth.org/648.html">certain parties</a> do wish certain other parties had paid more attention to them at the time. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I may try a rewrite to put more between the party and the ending - to be honest, the heart of the story was always what happened on the Boards, so I probably did neglect the ending a little. The other mental block I think I had is that Nita was the primary carrier of the story - not quite the viewpoint, but close. That was I think originally a stylistic decision (it meant we weren&#39;t privy to Peter&#39;s thought processes, so his breakdown was as surprising for us as it was for Nita) but after the edits that put the Peter-Justin asides in, I should have spotted and edited.<br><br>Basically the problem boils down to one paragraph - Nita&#39;s &#39;So the matter rested&#39; - and as David Eddings would be quick to point out, it&#39;s that &#39;a couple of months passed&#39; that does it all in.<br><br>I shall work on it (and on the emotion at the end - and maybe even Justin&#39;s fourth-wall-directed line for Phobos). Thankee.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Were he not currently in a DIA holding cell, Peter would be the first to point out that of <i>course</i> he was right &#39;too often&#39;, he&#39;s <i>always</i> right. But then, he&#39;s in a DIA holding cell, so don&#39;t listen to him. ~hS)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know where to begin.  Something about this story just rubs me the wrong way.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is very well written technically.  I just don&#39;t trust where this is going.<br><br>Here are some specific reasons that I can pick out:<br><br>1) Killing off those three flowers strikes me as the same kind of thing that happened with Makes-Things.<br><br>2) The line <i>&quot;[...]  The Head of Despatch – the third Action Department in PPC history - is dead.&quot;</i> feels to me like it is directed, not at Nita, but at the fourth wall.  It isn&#39;t exposition that needed to happen.

            <p>You&#39;re right that the &#39;third Action Department&#39; line is a certain level of grandstanding, but I consider it more to be Justin&#39;s utter dismay. It&#39;s as if someone turned away from the TV back in the, what, 60s? and said, &quot;JFK&#39;s dead. <i>The president has been shot.</i>&quot; It&#39;s an expression of disbelief - surely this can&#39;t happen, this is an <i>important person</i> we&#39;re talking about!<br><br>And yes, it&#39;s like what happened to Makes-Things - but those three are completely unused characters (really - the DMFF stories are only available any more because I went and rescued them, I&#39;ve never seen an Angst story, and Despatch? Not for most of a decade). I did briefly consider Peter going on a rampage through Bad Slash, killing off half their agents and the Lace... but then I stopped thinking that (and without even needing to be told!). And, of course, Swansong features the Mother Of All Get-outs - them being dead is Justin and Nita&#39;s assumption. All we know is that they&#39;re unconscious.<br><br>Plus, hey, got rid of some Yellow Roses. That&#39;s got to be worth something, right?<br><br>(No more deaths in the trilogy, I promise)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Those were the things that I could easily pick out in the story.  There is more to it than that.  I&#39;ve got this, admittedly vague, feeling that there is something else going on here; <i>outside</i> the story.

            <p>... for the PPC to remain in forced stasis? The heart of Swan&#39;s Egg is the question of what reality means - are the Agents and Flowers real, in any meaningful sense? If they are, what right do we have to force them to run the same paths over and again? And yes, I know that &#39;forced stasis&#39; and &#39;Floricide&#39; aren&#39;t opposites. :P<br><br>The PPC is not a stable system. It&#39;s metastable - and very meta - and it may well be a stable equilibrium, but by the rules of the universe, it is not stable. But it <i>has</i> been - nothing has been allowed to change (even Crashing Down only managed to kill one character who wasn&#39;t mine - the Wisteria, who at the time had only been mentioned once ever). So perhaps it&#39;s time something did.<br><br>... not that it will. Murderdeathkilling isn&#39;t the point of Swan&#39;s Egg, and will not happen again.

            <p><i>&gt;SeaTurtle has revived Intel, which hadn&#39;t had a new agent since Architeuthis</i><br><br>Do you want to be the one to let <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Intelligence/Reports/Crashed_Here">Kyaris</a> know that? She&#39;s part (the only part) of the previous revival of Intel - the one where I went and set up a whole system whereby people could write Intelligence Reports and tie them into the Unclaimed Badfic list. It didn&#39;t take off.<br><br>To answer your question, growth of the sort you describe is not change because it doesn&#39;t allow other people to write in a different manner. The Postal Department and Kitchen have stories (I&#39;m positive the Cafeteria staff had a story a long time ago, but I can&#39;t trace it; I thought it was Leto&#39;s work, but apparently not), but since those agents belong to their respective authors, no one else uses them. Intel has been running all along, just without stories. Etcetera. It doesn&#39;t add anything to the experience of a PPC writer in one of the common departments, and it doesn&#39;t add anything to the lives of their agents.<br><br>But I&#39;m not claiming destruction is &#39;the only means of change&#39;; you&#39;re creating a false dichotomy there. Change is <i>change</i>, positive or negative. Large-scale change shakes things up, and yes, the easiest way to do that is to blow things up (although you&#39;ll be glad to note that the Aloe has had a reprieve - &quot;You see, Lord Vader, [I] can be reasonable&quot;) - but it&#39;s far from the only way.<br><br>Remember, Swansong is only <i>Part One</i>. It sets the scene, little more. Real change - positive change - is coming.<br><br>hS<br><br>(I don&#39;t know, are they? Or are we doomed to never having a surprise ending because we have to ask in advance if it&#39;s okay? Or - since that&#39;s another false dichotomy - or... what?)</p>

            <p>... Okay, this got rather long and ranty toward the end. I&#39;m gonna leave it in, but I&#39;d just like to clarify at the outset that rantiness should not be mistaken for actual anger or anything like that. It shouldn&#39;t read as heated, but if it does, it&#39;s unintentional. Also, this is mainly talking about the conversation in this thread, not necessarily the story as a whole, since obviously I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the story as a whole yet.<br><br>- - - -<br><br>To address the allegedly false dichotomy, if destruction is not the only means of change, but developing old stuff and adding new stuff doesn&#39;t count, then what does? Please explain.<br><br>Also, if change = &quot;allow[ing] other people to write in a different manner,&quot; I don&#39;t see how destruction even counts. Destruction doesn&#39;t <i>allow</i> people to write differently, it forcibly removes options. Destruction is not change, either; destruction is the death of potential.<br><br>You&#39;ve essentially decided that no one can ever again write for the Waterlily Commander or the Hydrangea. I&#39;m not sure I consented to this. If I did, I think I&#39;d like to revoke that consent now that I&#39;ve thought it through.<br><br>Here&#39;s why I think this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth: by saving Trojie&#39;s NPC but not these two, you&#39;ve made a judgement call that some people&#39;s NPCs have more right than others&#39; to go on having potential. Trojie wrote a whole heck of a lot and her seat&#39;s barely cooled; her stuff is safe. Meg Thornton and Elvea Aure, though, they&#39;ve been gone practically forever and didn&#39;t do as much, and their departments didn&#39;t catch on anyway; their NPCs are acceptable targets.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s your actual reasoning, but the implication still exists. I have a problem with this. If I get a life and vanish for two, five, ten years, and nobody else ever touches FicPsych again, should I expect to come back and find that someone has taken a flamethrower to the department and left everything I ever created there in ashes? When does my right to have left a piece of me behind in the world expire? What about yours, or VM&#39;s, or SeaTurtle&#39;s, or Joe&#39;s, or anyone else&#39;s?<br><br>Granted, not everything catches on, and that&#39;s a judgement call, too. The key difference is that choosing not to use something is not the same as choosing that no one can ever use it again.<br><br>So, the issue as I see it is not respect for the fictional PPC&#39;s right to change (and let&#39;s just keep our feet on the ground for a minute here and treat it as entirely imaginary and not really real), but respect for the real-world people who want to play in this sandbox. I believe the point of the moratorium on emergencies and destroying stuff was so that new people can enjoy the PPC more or less the same way their predecessors did, because that&#39;s what they&#39;ve read about, and that&#39;s what they came for. If things change too much, eventually it&#39;s not going to be the PPC anymore; it&#39;s going to be something else with the same name.<br><br>And no, you don&#39;t have the right to make that decision for us. Tawaki didn&#39;t, and you don&#39;t, and no one does. If you want to make changes that affect everyone, you need to consult everyone. Surprise endings must needs take a back seat to respecting your fellows. If you want to write surprise murderdeathCHANGE scenes, that&#39;s fine, but this is not the place for it.<br><br>Now, the rest of the change in this story, the bit concerning the message, that DOES have a consent process built in. That&#39;s different. If it catches on (as it seems to be doing), that&#39;s all voluntary, and that&#39;s fine.<br><br>It&#39;s not okay to make decisions for people who aren&#39;t around to give consent, though. That&#39;s why killing off other people&#39;s NPCs bugs me. I don&#39;t think even the community as a whole has the right to do that. Ignore, yes. Destroy, no. Only the character&#39;s creator has the right to destroy it, whether they&#39;ve allowed other people to use it or not. If I say you can use my apple tree, I mean you can pick apples, or sit in the branches, or maybe even take some firewood now and then; and you don&#39;t have to if you don&#39;t want to. I do <i>not</i> mean that you can burn it down, even if nobody picks apples from it for ten years. Right to use is not the same as right to destroy.<br><br>[/soapbox]<br><br>~Neshomeh, who needs tea now.</p>

            <p>...Here are my thoughts:<br><br>I think hS has a point. There does need to be change, sometimes, in the form of death of characters maybe? <br><br>I don&#39;t know. <br><br>But without some form of change, people are going to get bored, there won&#39;t be any new ideas, new characters. <br><br>Yes, the Hydrangea and Waterlily Commander are dead, but that means people can make *new*, fresh characters to take their place. <br><br>If we have to ask about every change we want to make, where&#39;s the fun in all this? What&#39;s the fun in writing for a fanon, where we can&#39;t do what we want? Where we have to stick to the old, stale formula? <br><br>Yeah, the PPC is comedy at heart, but that doesn&#39;t mean we CAN&#39;T have the odd serious thing every so-often. <br><br>Let&#39;s take a look at Bob and George, I&#39;m sure at least *one* person here other than me has read that webcomic. It kept it&#39;s comedic beginnings all-throughout the comic, even when &quot;serious&quot; arcs were going on.<br><br>Of course, I&#39;m not saying we should have emergencies where major characters die at the drop of a hat every other day. <br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve ranted long enough.

            <p>That actually is required. Not from me specifically (and my comment about revoking consent was an expression of personally not accepting that killing off other people&#39;s NPCs is okay), but that&#39;s exactly what Permission is. hS did, in the beginning, need consent from somebody to play here.

I do not agree with &quot;If you don&#39;t like it, feel free to destroy it in your fic.&quot; Naturally I wouldn&#39;t accept it as fact if somebody did that to one of my characters without permission, but it would still be a slap in my face, and I&#39;d probably not allow that person anywhere near my stuff again. I mean... if you&#39;re playing with someone else&#39;s toys, you give them back in good condition. That&#39;s consideration, politeness, respect. Right?<br><br>Whatever hS&#39;s track record is, I don&#39;t think killing off other people&#39;s contributions is respectful. Fanfic may not be srs bsns, but treating others with respect is. I presume my point on that score at least was well-made, since he did decide to take my arguments on board and change stuff. If y&#39;all think I&#39;m actually talking nonsense here, though, please don&#39;t act on it. It&#39;s confusing.

She was assured it would not be the case, and we also had a look over at one of the items involved. We were given and informed of one thing, and this presented us with something entirely different.<br><br>Now, I must apologize, because this goes against something we try to emphasis against, with regards to this statement: <br><br><i>Once you get permission, there&#39;s no difference between &quot;Newbie&quot; and &quot;Oldbie&quot;.</i><br><br>Unfortunately, this is not true. Once you have permission, it only means you have permission. Nothing more, nothing less. It means you are less of a newbie. It does not automatically mean you are an oldbie. An oldbie, by any meaning, is someone who has been around. They have seen the community grow, and change. They have seen what has happened, and have been involved in those things. <br><br>Your perspective as a newbie is completely different. Please take this in the politest way possible: you do not actually know what you are saying.<br><br><i>I&#39;m a newbie here, but as for the Tawaki thing, I see no reason for you not to say, &quot;Hang on, This doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot; I&#39;ve looked at said agents profile, and yeah. I&#39;d say he seems to be a bit of a Stu.</i><br><br>The reason that no one said that is because when this first went on, we very much subscribed to what Kaitlyn has described. It&#39;s not our right to interfere with what he&#39;s writing. It doesn&#39;t change what the rest of us write, after all. We have no place calling him out on his agents since he has permission. And so on.<br><br>Unfortunately, if we had said something early on, we&#39;d not have had what happened. We would not have had multiple massive ripoffs of various canon plots, nor would we have had several wrongfully overpowered agents around. We would not have the current moratorium on events and crises. <br><br>The reaction to Huinesoron&#39;s story here, for the most part, is because, if I understand correctly Neshomeh&#39;s thoughts here, she is concerned that he is doing something that is restrictive to the PPC as a whole, for the worse. This is not due to his skill or ability as a writer, or what he personally has done. It has to do with how everyone else  interprets and or thinks of how they should implement it in their own stories.<br><br>The PPC is not intended to be a massive serious place. It is a loose web of strands, spin-offs connected to others, but not all of them.<br><br>People have already told me they&#39;re worried about how they&#39;re supposed to be reacting to this story of hS&#39;. Their view of the PPC doesn&#39;t align with what he&#39;s shown here, they have said. Their thoughts on how  meta the PPC is doesn&#39;t align with what he&#39;s shown here, they have said. Their agents wouldn&#39;t think like this, they have said. Now, they are worried because they think they have to follow it, since hS wrote it.<br><br>I appreciate that you&#39;ve decided to speak up here, but the thing is, you have no background to base what you are saying on, and you have no understanding of the history of what has happened before to appreciate Neshomeh&#39;s concerns, or the concerns of others where this is involved. </p>

I do have a habit of butting into things without all the facts, yes. It&#39;s a flaw of mine. :/<br><br><br>As for the Newbie/Oldbie thing, you misunderstand what I am saying. I didn&#39;t mean that you suddenly become an Oldbie. I know the term quite well. What I mean is, is that time should not be an issue, in that case. <br><br>Let&#39;s say &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;John&quot; are both people who have been given permission. &quot;John&quot; has been around for a long time. <br><br>A good few years, and has had permission for equally as long. (Not including the standard one month, of course.) <br><br>&quot;Sam&quot; has only been around for a month or so, and has very recently received permission. Therefore, they are both equal in that regard, and each one should have just as much right, etc. to give concrit. <br><br>And both their opinions should be regarded equally, new or Old. <br><br>In fact, &quot;Sam&quot; could well be a much better writer than &quot;John&quot;. But just because &quot;John&quot; isn&#39;t the best writer, his concrit should still be regarded the same as &quot;Sam&quot;&#39;s. Do you get what I&#39;m saying?<br><br>As for the fact that people will be &quot;forced&quot; to follow what he&#39;s doing. Of course they don&#39;t. Look at Makes-Things. He apparently &quot;died&quot;. But everyone just kind of Ignored that.<br><br>You are right, in that I probably don&#39;t know as much as I should. But I spent a while on the wiki, reading up on crisis&#39; and why they are bad. The conclusion *I* came to, is because they were too frequent, and that one of them killed off a major character. That has not been done here. hS&#39; has &quot;killed&quot; two minor, non-important flowers, who as far as I&#39;m aware, haven&#39;t been touched on in ages. <br><br>If you want to use them, you can hand-wave what happened. <br><br>But I think my point from before still stands. Them dying has opened up opportunities for people to make new flowers for those departments, and therefore, make things a bit more &quot;fresh&quot;. <br><br>But that&#39;s just my opinion, and I understand that most people here are happy with cozy regularity. (No sarcasm intended there.)<br><br>On to my next point. &quot;Now, they are worried because they think they have to follow it, since hS wrote it.&quot;<br><br>IMO, hS writing it shouldn&#39;t have anything to do with it, that&#39;s part of my Newbie/Oldbie thing. It shouldn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s hS. it shouldn&#39;t matter who wrote it, unless they are called Jay or Acacia. At least, that&#39;s what I think.</p>

            <p>First, you&#39;re right, your opinion has value whether you&#39;re old or new. This doesn&#39;t have anything to do with that, and it&#39;s not really about writing quality.<br><br>The problem here is that you don&#39;t have the background knowledge we&#39;re working from.<br><br>The Makes-Things thing: it wasn&#39;t just ignored by everybody. Like July said, we seriously were unable to say anything at the time because we were all operating under &quot;Permission means you can do anything.&quot; That&#39;s just how it was back then. Makes-Things was effectively dead—no appearances in spin-offs or anything if they weren&#39;t set before Spring 2008—for roughly three years, until I wrote him back in. People had been muttering behind their hands about it the whole time, mind you, but nobody did anything until I did.<br><br>&quot;It shouldn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s hS&quot;: it shouldn&#39;t, but it does. hS is what you might call a Big Name Fan, and has been for a long time. See, first he wrote the original DOGA spin-off, which is pretty widely regarded as awesome. Then he wrote stuff like <i>The Reorganisation</i> and the other history stories, which were also heralded as masterworks and accepted into everyone&#39;s headcanon with open arms, despite that hS <i>very much</i> made it clear that it wasn&#39;t expected.<br><br>After that it just never stopped. You see up there where July is saying about how hS doesn&#39;t want to be the Glorious Leader of the PPC? It&#39;s true. There was a time when <i>many people</i> took hS&#39;s prolific writing and general acceptance to mean that he was trying to take over everything, and I believe I was actually the one to finally stand up and tell them to stop it because they were being jerks.<br><br>So like... it&#39;s real easy to say it doesn&#39;t matter, but we&#39;re living with all this history. hS is somebody whose stuff is pretty much all accepted by everyone, so it&#39;s not much of a stretch to wonder if this is meant to be accepted.<br><br>- - - -<br><br>Unrelated to issues of context: I disagree that killing off Flowers necessarily opens up spaces for new ones. This would be true if we were talking about big, active departments that need Heads, like the DMS and Floaters, but a) nobody&#39;s going to kill them off because they are established canon characters like Makes-Things, and b) we&#39;re not talking about them; the Hydrangea and the Waterlily Commander are Heads of departments that nobody has used in years. This doesn&#39;t open the way for new stuff so much as put the last nail in the coffin of those departments, IMO.<br><br>Let me know if I can clarify any more.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m honestly not fussed.  I&#39;m happy to see the PPC nurture blossoming writers, as long as they&#39;re actually trying to create something of value (though I will say, Makes-things was never dead to me.  Saw it in the sandbox, turned and went the other way, never gave it another second&#39;s thought).<br><br>But sure we can say something -- the recent refocus on concrit has been great.  However, when we start trying to literally dictate what our fellow fanficcers are allowed to write, just because we write stories in the same loosely-connected universe, the whole thing becomes an exercise in absurdity and takin&#39;-it-all-too-much-to-heart.</p>

            <p>Generally speaking I don&#39;t really care what anybody else does as long as they&#39;re not interfering with me or hurting people—I seriously don&#39;t want to dictate the plot of anybody&#39;s spin-off. But on the other hand, there&#39;s still the issue of using your PPC Permission to write PPC stuff, not something else entirely. If, in your spin-off, you kill all the Flowers, burn down Headquarters, and make all the surviving agents into free-floating clusters of refugees who couldn&#39;t care less about bad writing anymore because they&#39;re busy fighting the evil robot aliens from Dimension X, what exactly does this have to do with us? Why write in the PPC universe if all you really wanted to do was something different?<br><br>This is taking the idea of changing things to an utter extreme, but that&#39;s why I balk at just letting anyone do anything. No, it doesn&#39;t directly affect me because I can ignore it, and no, it&#39;s probably not going to actually hurt anyone &#39;cause it&#39;s just a story, but I just don&#39;t <i>get</i> it. If you ask for Permission to write PPC stories, I feel justified in expecting PPC stories, not &quot;let&#39;s overturn the dining room table of the universe&quot; stories. You can do that somewhere else—here is for PPC stuff. The universe may be loosely connected, but it <i>is</i> connected by certain things the various spin-offs are supposed to have in common.<br><br>So, in the end, I am just confused.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yes, some of us do have an emotional investment in the PPC.  While I know that officially, we are writing fan fiction for the series Jay and Acacia created, it&#39;s different from Sherlock Holmes and X-Men and Harry Potter because we <i>are</i> contributing to the canon as we write.  You needn&#39;t look any further for evidence than the fact that games and RPs are frequently named as canon or non-canon at their outset (AHAIRQL versus the Badfic Game), something that&#39;s would never be relevant for X-Men fans conducting an RP.  There&#39;s also cases like Chliever&#39;s spinoff and &quot;Agents&quot; Ice and Gabriella, which have been declared non-canon by their author and the community, respectively.<br><br>There&#39;s an additional level of involvement for the PPC.  I don&#39;t know off-hand if anyone still active today ever interacted with Jay or Acacia, but the fact that any of us could have interacted personally with the original authors gives the PPC a greater level of intimacy than Harry Potter fans have interacting with J.K. Rowling (and certainly a greater level of intimacy than the Sherlock Holmes fandom has with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who, so far as I know, has never deigned to answer fan questions in an open forum.  I guess that &quot;Sir&quot; has gone to his head.)<br><br>So yes, there is a sense of emotional investment in the PPC because I have contributed to this canon, in a sense that a fanfic writer for any other continuum can&#39;t be said to have done.  As a result of that, I feel a sense of responsibility towards it.  And it is difficult to just <i>ignore</i> Huinesoron&#39;s latest story as non-canon when I&#39;ve already accepted not only everything that he has written as canon, but everything else anyone has written as canon (barring situations like the above-mentioned Agent Ice, but including Chliever&#39;s stuff because I liked it and I&#39;m weird like that).<br><br>—doctorlit, who wrote this in the half-hour just after waking up and hopes it has at least a thin patina of sensible thought</p>

            <p>More than a patina of sense, I think. {= )<br><br>But yeah, it&#39;s that level of involvement that does it, I think, and it doesn&#39;t just go for here. You only have to look as far as those shipping wars to know that people get <i>very</i> emotionally involved with their fandoms. We come to know these fictional people and places through their story, and we come to care about what happens to them—at least, we do if the writing&#39;s any good—and that extends easily to what happens to them in fanfic. As far as I can determine as someone not actually inside their heads, Jay and Acacia were emotionally involved with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and that&#39;s why they started the PPC in the first place: it bothered them to see people getting it so far wrong over and over again, and they decided to have some fun and catharsis at the same time. I think that&#39;s probably why lots of us joined up: fun and catharsis, and you can&#39;t have catharsis without emotions.<br><br>And then, once you&#39;ve been hanging around the Board and/or writing PPC stories a while, the time and energy commitment starts to add up to greater emotional investment, too. It&#39;s the same as any kind of club in that respect. I&#39;m perhaps more emotionally involved than other people because I&#39;ve been actively writing about my characters and being a part of this group for a real damn long time, and that means something to me. I have friends here, and that means something, too. I have a story to tell, I am a writer, and I can&#39;t <i>not</i> be emotionally invested in my work, my acts of creation. Learning to detach enough to take concrit is a hard lesson for a lot of us, ya know? It&#39;s just natural to be emotionally invested in things that you make, whether it&#39;s writing, art, songs, a sandcastle, whatever. I have heard of authors comparing writing a book with raising a child, George R. R. Martin, for one. Obviously it&#39;s not exactly the same, but the point is, creating something and being involved in its growth and development is an emotional experience.<br><br>And we&#39;re all contributing to this big shared universe, and seeing it grow and develop with each new spin-off. Part of the fun is that we&#39;re all doing it together, or at least alongside one another. Of course we&#39;re going to care what other people do with it.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say that moderation shouldn&#39;t happen, though. Like I said, you have to learn to gird your loins and hear concrit (if you want to improve), and yeah, there are things that can be interpreted differently, and that shouldn&#39;t be a basis for hatred and vitriol. I think shipping wars are silly, myself, and I wouldn&#39;t miss them if they disappeared forever . . . but then, I&#39;m not really interested in who sleeps with whom in any sphere of my life. It&#39;s not my bag—I can let other people worry about that stuff. That&#39;s what the DBS is for; I&#39;m more concerned with things making logical and narrative sense, so it&#39;s the DIC and DMS for me.<br><br>. . . Kaitlyn, I&#39;m kinda wondering why you joined up. If you&#39;re not invested in your fandoms or writing at all, what brought you here in the first place? Also, what&#39;s the difference when it comes to other people being more emotionally committed than you—why does that concern you? I&#39;m curious, because on the surface it doesn&#39;t seem to fit with &quot;don&#39;t be so bothered about what other people do&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t expect everyone see things the same way you do.&quot; I&#39;m genuinely puzzled and wanting to know.<br><br>Also, to address the bit about expecting other people to see things the exact same way: I&#39;ll be honest, if I can talk someone into seeing it my way, I will certainly enjoy that, and so of course I&#39;ll try. But I don&#39;t object to anyone honestly disagreeing with me, as long as they&#39;re polite about it, and I&#39;m not going to go cry in a corner or anything if I don&#39;t succeed. It helps if they actually have a solid case based on facts and principles and stuff, too, just because it&#39;s easier to understand why the difference exists that way, and I like understanding. I also like being right and winning arguments, but making the effort isn&#39;t the same as expecting to succeed all the time. I don&#39;t want anyone to capitulate without actually being convinced by what I have to say. That&#39;s a hollow victory at best; it&#39;s not satisfying. {= P<br><br>So no, I don&#39;t expect everyone to see everything the exact same way I do. That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t give it a shot, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I was a cute little thirteen-year-old with nothing better to worry about: fandom could take up a big space in my life then.  But there&#39;s a lot about my life and priorities that has changed since I was thirteen, thank goodness.<br><br>I&#39;ve mostly stuck around (lurking menacingly in the background for the most part) because hS has.  It&#39;s part of his life, he&#39;s part of my life, so I keep at least half an eye on the PPC at all times.<br><br>I&#39;m not &quot;concerned&quot; if other people are deeply emotionally invested.  It certainly doesn&#39;t bother me, everyone has their hobbies.  I watched the PPC grow from a few tiny missions on FF.N (and interacted with J&amp;A, as has hS), so yes, I get why people feel a sense of ownership and protectiveness.  I still can&#39;t relate to the pathos, but I don&#39;t begrudge anybody their strange human emotions.  ;)<br><br>I&#39;m only concerned about actual attempts to dictate what other people are allowed to write.  I know that fandom can dredge up some serious ~feelings~, but those feelings don&#39;t grant either moral or actual authority over other people&#39;s work.</p>

            <p>I think you may be confusing my feelings with my reasons for acting on them, though. I felt something was off long before I actually spoke up about it, which only happened after I&#39;d worked out why I was feeling that way and thought I could explain it. My feelings don&#39;t give me authority, I agree, but my argument on behalf of my standpoint should, if it is judged to be sound.<br><br>I did use some stronger language than I usually like to do, by which I mean I failed to qualify some of my statements with modifiers like &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;in my opinion,&quot; etc. This is because I was pretty well convinced that my case was a strong one and it could support such language. However, I only get authority when I say things like that if other people agree that I&#39;m right and that they should do what I say.<br><br>Let me try putting it this way: just as hS can&#39;t actually change stuff in the PPC if we don&#39;t agree that he can, I can&#39;t actually order people around unless they agree that I can.<br><br>If the person I&#39;m talking to agrees that I can tell them what to do based on my argument, then I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m at fault. If I&#39;ve wielded the authority I&#39;ve been given like a club, I should definitely be chastised, but I&#39;m not convinced I&#39;ve done that. I gave reasons for my opinion; I made a case. I can&#39;t think of a time I&#39;ve ever asked anyone to take me solely at my word. I make it a point not to say anything unless I think I can back it up, and if it turns out I&#39;m wrong anyway, I will (however grudgingly) admit it and change my stance. That requires a good, solid counterargument, though; I&#39;m not just going to change my mind and fold without some serious convincing first.<br><br>So... where did I go wrong here?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>. . . no wrong at all.  It&#39;s fine to raise objections, to offer concrit, etc etc etc, as long as you know that&#39;s all you&#39;re doing.

            <p>This is a very interesting concept. Having agents discover the Board and wondering if they&#39;re just fictional (which of course they are- sorry Justin) just begs for some deep existential discussions... or not. The idea of also being influenced by another sinister power is intriguing.<br><br>I seriously don&#39;t know what to believe: is the flash patch really a contact neuralyzer? Ever since you first asked for the Message cowrite, you&#39;ve stated that the entire thing has a built-in neuralyzer effect, thus lending credibility to this theory. On the other hand, I personally believe the the flash patch is just an SEP field like Justin says it is... You&#39;ve done a really good job setting this situation up. Hats off to you, sir.<br><br>This does clear up some of the stuff that happened at the Christmas party. Interesting...<br><br>I can&#39;t wait for the next part. Keep up the good work!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen other examples of meta in PPC fics but this is way different. Every other time it was used as comedy and if I was told there was a story about an agent finding the Board I would have assumed that to be comedy as well but this is really intense. I&#39;m now going to spend the next two weeks waiting for this to be finished.</p>

            <p>Speaking as somebody who regularly checks the Board (every few hours or so), I&#39;ve noticed something.<br><br>The badfic thread is <i>huge.</i>  As of 19:40 (my time), the front page of the Board had a total of 533 posts.  This is roughly 22 pages worth of scrolling.  The badfic thread alone has 142 posts.  This roughly (excuse my horrible math skills) 25% of the total posts on the Board.  That is a lot of posts.<br><br>Now, I know that we have reasons for posting all the badfic posts in one thread, and I see most of them as being good ones.  However, well, 142 posts is a lot. For me, this is five screens worth of scrolling, which can be annoying when I&#39;m looking for new posts further down.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only one who has a problem with this, so I guess I&#39;d like to put forth a couple of questions.<br><br>1) Is the badfic thread too long?<br>2) Should we have some standards for badfic thread lengths before we start a new one?<br>3) If so, what should they be?</p>

            <p>One of my points to having it be on the other &#39;Board, the others of which include things like &quot;Let&#39;s not tell people what they&#39;re not allowed to talk about unless they&#39;re breaking rules,&quot; and &quot;If people are enjoying it, maybe killing it isn&#39;t a bad thing,&quot; and &quot;Badfic threads will continue to pop up, so we might as well come up with a Solution, rather than a temporary avoid,&quot; so on and so forth.</p>

            <p>If <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Marriage_Contracts">this</a> exactly counts, but... Hoo boy. It&#39;s bad.  It&#39;s really bad. Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts<br><br>The writing is okay, and there are very few grammar/spelling or other errors, but... Wow. I didn&#39;t think it was possible to bend Harry Potter canon that far (please, don&#39;t mention My Immortal), but wow.<br><br>Harry and Neville are...mostly alright. Hermione&#39;s become some sort of...out-of-character person obsessed with sex (at least it&#39;s only with Ron), Ron is evil, Ginny&#39;s a skanky whore (no, I am not exaggerating that, nor insulting the character), and the Weasleys--with the exception of Mr. Weasely and the Twins--are pretty much evil. Haven&#39;t found the two oldest yet, but... *sighs* Then there&#39;s the fact that Harry&#39;s revenge throughout the story is over the top in violence and cruelty. Also, Dumbledore is still alive and a complete and utter berk, along with being dark-grey evil and manipulative.<br><br>Have I missed anything? Sheesh. That&#39;s the <i>last</i> time I click on a link from TVTro... Oh hey, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4OpLMqJRM&amp;feature=related">link</a>!

            <p>Maybe they know how to use some kind of bizarro spell-check from Bizarro World because I could not understand a word that was coming out of that fic.  Was that even English?  All I saw was sl;dkfjsdl;kfjsl;kfjaowirweoiuvm fangirl japanese l;sdkjf;lkdfjasl;fkdjfkasjff bakka (she even got the fangirl japanese wrong!)  I didn&#39;t even see any indication that it was supposed to be an Ouran fic aside from the fact that it was set in a school and they mentioned the club a couple of times.  Maybe my brain just shut off to prevent some kind of traumatic brain injury.</p>

            <p>but other than that it had no connection to the series. And when I said they used spell-check I meant that they went through their Word doc. or whatever, made sure all the underlined words were in Japanese, and posted it. I&#39;m just happy it&#39;s a one shot.</p>

Her English is not very good and I skimmed most of her ranting, here are the high points:<br><br>&quot;The story of Emily 2 (the version of 2011) begins in September 1993 where she is 28 and the Muggle aunt of Lavender Brown who has no clue about the magical world.... She visits her sister in England and want to bring her niece to the Hogwarts Express, but because she has to carry one of Lavender suitcases inside the train, she&#39;s still there when the trains starts. And after Remus Lupin discovers her, he&#39;s not sure what to do with her, so he sents her later to the castle. Emily has to stay the whole year, cause the Ministry of Magic sees of the possibility that Sirius Black tries to kill or use her in order to get nearer to Harry Potter and so she has to stay with Severus Snape down in the dungeons, cause he should protect her and has an extra room in his flat. (Actually all of this is a secret plan of Dumbledore to bring her close to Snape and to seal his loyalty to the good side)&quot;<br><br>... Half of one question in a 21 question FAQ. =_=<br><br>&quot;17. How can you say that Emily isn&#39;t a Mary Sue or a self-insert character when she looks totally like you?<br>At first I&#39;m not looking exactly like her (nor would I wear everything of her clothes) and second, it was more that I designed Emily first with the red hair (I always loved that hair colour) and then became myslef more and more like her by dying my hair and let it grow long. Finally I wanted to cosplay her and so it is necessary to look like the character, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br><br>...So she&#39;s turning herself into her Sue, not the other way around.<br><br>She also has a rather &#39;lovely&#39; rant on why she hates Lily Evans, which can be found here: <a href="http://fav.me/d3pn8ch"><a href="http://fav.me/d3pn8ch">http://fav.me/d3pn8ch</a></a><br><br></p>

            <p>May I present <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7607742/1/"> The Marines have landed </a>. If you&#39;re from New Zealand, I suggest drinking a large amount of alcohol first.

What... *eye twitches* As the member of a heavily-military oriented family, I find this so bleeping offensive. (I&#39;ve also borrowed a tv studio&#39;s profanity filter so I can write this rant.)<br><br>The writing itself isn&#39;t bad, if the writer were a beginning or mid-level ESL student. It follows most conventions, although it doesn&#39;t grasp any form of punctuation. And has no grasp of history... Or...<br><br>*sighs* You&#39;d think someone posting in the Hogan&#39;s Heroes fandom would know better. Or could at least do a little basic research for World War Two. What&#39;s really insulting is that the Mary Sue in this story is almost an expy of the writer--who is from New Zealand, I&#39;m so sorry--except &quot;speshuler&quot;. It&#39;s just... *headdesks repeatedly in hopes of a concussion*<br><br>It&#39;s not NSFW, but I find it rather painful to read. &#39;scuse me, I&#39;ve got to return a filter and find a bottle of bleepka.</p>

            <p>If I had to guess, New Zealand didn&#39;t have a Marine Corps at the time and even if they did they wouldn&#39;t be fighting World War II in Europe.<br><br>There were a few things that made me head-tilt; I haven&#39;t seen Hogan&#39;s Heroes and maybe it&#39;s just a fixture of the show but allowing a POW to be interrogated in any other situation besides alone and in a 2x4 seems like a terrible idea.  Insubordination.  Disrespecting superiors.  Being a senior field grade officer in enemy territory for classified reasons.  Attempting to acquire classified information from allies.  Conduct unbecoming an officer.  Improper conduct during capture.  Multiple counts of assault on the English language.  Women in a combat branch.<br><br>Sound about right?</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve used some pretty strong words in your second comment on the Pokémon fic there.  That&#39;s really not okay.  This community is about laughing at bad writing, not about saying rude and potentially hurtful things to other fanfic writers.  You call them a bad author for attacking people, but the truth is, you are attacking them right back.<br><br>It is unfortunate that not all authors you&#39;ll encounter are willing to listen to criticism.

            <p>OK, what the frig? So much wrongness. Applejack is now Texas apparently. Also, since I myself do have mild Aspergers, yeah, there&#39;s no way that Fluttershy has it. If anypony has it, it&#39;s definitely Twilight. But on the other hand, this isn&#39;t Aspergers; clearly it&#39;s aspersers, a strange Mary-Sue-induced disease that causes violent, rude personality shifts when the person who has it comes into contact with a religious Mary Sue. </p>

Lucia gets a Millenium KEYCHAIN, a shiny personalized card, an Egyptian-god-induced makeover, and a new name (Sapphire Shuja) She promptly proceeds to, I assume, break the plot, and cheating her way through. Now, onto the part that REALLY bugs me.<br><br>See, apparently, Vivio Takamachi (Nanoha and Fate&#39;s adopted daughter--this is a MGLN and YGO crossover) somehow got a hold of a Device and teleported herself to Earth (even though she already has a device and doesn&#39;t know HOW to teleport.) Nanoha, apparently forgetting that she was born on Earth and has family there, as well as there being two former admirals living there, laments that Earth is a planet of nonmagical people and therefore she can&#39;t, you know, call up her parents (her aunt is the head of an antiterrorism agency, her father is a former ninja bodyguard with Connections, her two elder siblings are also ninjas, she is personal family friends with an insanely rich European singer, you get the idea) or go to Earth herself, or tell the police there that a blond girl with green/red heterochromia has gone missing. Nope, Vivio, who for WHATEVER REASON decided to NOT call up her grandparents, decides to change her name to Sarah Noppers and gets adopted immediately by the Sennens, apparently without anyone asking where she came from, where her parents are, anything reasonable. Then, even though Nanoha exists in this universe and the Sue-group is all huge fans of it, no one connects the two. Oh yeah, there&#39;s three auxilliary Sues who get introduced many chapters in, and apparently one of them is... freakishly obsessed with Fate, to the point of wearing clothes themed after her and making herself look like the spitting image of Fate. Again, Vivio never notices the connection between fangirl!Sue and her mom, and apparently takes the news that she&#39;s fictional quite well. Then, somehow, they get a visit from Chrono, who, AGAIN, doesn&#39;t seem to notice that his adopted niece is right there, and confuses Fangirl!Sue for Fate. They all get ripoff devices and go on to wreck more plot.<br><br>And yes, I probably missed many, many, manymanymany stupid things. But, I don&#39;t know Yu-Gi-Oh outside of riffing a few episodes with my friends and watching the Abridged Series, so I can&#39;t do this alone. Please help, Boarders, you&#39;re my only hope.</p>

            <p>And, JUST from chapter 6:<br><br>Agito goes to Earth to get a letter from Vivio. So, they KNOW WHERE SHE IS, YET THEY DON&quot;T GO GET HER. Also, Agito is a six-inch-tall fire-mage flying person, who of course can just go to the postal office and grab a letter.<br>Somehow, Lucia has enough magic to take out Nanoha and Fate at once. At age nine.<br>The Sennen family decides to adopt Vivio, assumes she&#39;s Japanese (even though she doesn&#39;t look anything like a Japanese person, being blond and having Christmas-tree eyes), she takes a new name for NO REASON, and...

            <p>Oh yeah--Vivio is from Mid-Childa, an alien world. She shouldn&#39;t know how to speak Japanese, or know anything about it aside from what her mothers have told her. And, somehow, the Chinese all hate the Japanese... What? She shouldn&#39;t be able to even speak any Earth languages, or be able to get through their civilization, which is full of stuff she has no clue how to use. I doubt Nanoha and Fate told her about, say, public transportation on Earth, or the currency, or the languages, or the major cultures, or anything that wouldn&#39;t make her sound like a complete nutjob. Also, Vivio is six.</p>

            <p>Um, I know both MGLN and Yu Gi Oh well. I read the fic. It&#39;s atrociously terribad. Aside from what you noted, there are instances of fangirl Japanese, bad SPaG, Minis, bad fangirl Japanese (ie, putting Japanese in the &#39;fic and getting it /wrong/), uncanon spells, uncanon YGO cards, uncanon Devices...<br>Also, the bnei zonot turned Mokuba and Seto Kaiba into misogynistic bastards, drove all of the canons so OOC they can&#39;t touch canon with an elven-feet pole, and have no idea how Yu Gi Oh (the game) works, either in the animé or IRL.<br>I can go on and on, but this, and what you&#39;ve noted, is enough to say that this &#39;fic is terribad. I&#39;d very much like to help you with it, but I must note that I haven&#39;t got my permission yet (though I&#39;m working on it).</p>

            <p>I was going over your missions, and I noticed that you got a charge wrong in the first one. The charge in question, having a Barrier Jacket without having an Intelligent Device, is wrong, because multiple people who don&#39;t use Intelligent Devices have Barrier Jackets -- Chrono (his Devices, S2U and Durandal are Storage Devices), Yuuno (doesn&#39;t use a Device), Vita, Shamal, Signum, Hayate, Erio and Sister Schach (who all use Armed Devices) are all examples of that.<br>Also, thanks for the encouragement.</p>

The characters basically just go by country names, and that&#39;s it. The personalities and appearances don&#39;t match at all. The connection to Twilight is also similarly tenuous. Esme appears once, period. The setting makes no sense. The formatting is atrocious.</p>

            <p>...As a general guideline, I, at least, prefer that cowrites that operate like this are done with people who have experience writing missions already, rather than people who have recently gained permission and haven&#39;t yet written many missions yet.<br><br>The idea with allowing it this- people without permission cowriting with someone who does- is so that people who are doing it can gain experience by working with someone who has experience already.</p>

            <p>...I actually enoyed this, and found quite a bit of it funny. It definately needs fixing up in some places, but it&#39;s not spork-worthy, and definately not a bleepfic.</p>

            <p>What I&#39;m reading is a completely random setup that breaks many of the rules of the canon and forces the characters to act OOC.<br><br>The first chapter alone has major levels of OOCness. Xemnas and Axel are not people to be effed with, and could probably KILL the two OC nobodies that are introduced to keep Axel from leaving.<br><br>In the second chapter, Sora hand an OC his keyblade. Let me say that again: <b>Sora hands her his keyblade.</b> This. Is not. Possible. Keyblades are very very picky about their wielders, and unless this random OC is a wielder, this should not happen. For example, Sora handed Jack Sparrow his keyblade, and it almost immediately teleported back to his hand. This is what <b>should</b> happen.<br><br>Then, she starts attacking Sora, with his own weapon, while screaming &quot;WHY DID YOU KILL THE ORGANIZATION? THEY. WERE. MY. FRIENDS! WHY COULDN&#39;T YOU JUST KILL MANSEX AND LEAVE EVERYONE ELSE ALONE?&quot; Or at least I think it’s her, there isn&#39;t a tag next to it. Anyone who knows canon knows that the Organization needed to be stopped. They were hurting people. &quot;They were my friends?&quot; None of them had friends except for Axel,Xion, and Roxas, who were a special case. And how are they <b>her</b> friends? &quot;Why couldn&#39;t you just kill Mansex and leave everyone else alone?&quot; Because Xemnas wasn&#39;t the only one responsible for hurting people.<br><br>&quot;Angie threw the keyblade, which hit Xemnas in the face, then retrieved it, and pulled Sora&#39;s underwear over the top causing THE ULTIMATE WEDGIE!&quot;<br><br>...You find this funny? You don&#39;t see a problem with this? Because I do. This OC should be dead by now.<br><br>The next two dares involve Cloud, <b>Sephiroth</b>, and <b>Master Xehanort.</b> Cloud. Sephiroth. Master Xehanort. Do I need to point out what&#39;s wrong with this and why the OC should be dead by now?<br><br>And not only does MX comply with the dare, but it shows a complete lack of respect towards his character. And this isn&#39;t the only dare that shows a lack of respect either. It goes on and on.<br><br>This isn&#39;t funny. This doesn’t show respect towards the characters. This isn&#39;t a good fanfic.</p>

            <p>Hey, Calm down. Fanfic isn&#39;t all SRS BSNS. It&#39;s not even a serious fic, in fact. It&#39;s just meant to be a random, silly fic, where people can do silly and humiliating things to characters they enjoy. <br><br>I am a massive fan of the Kingdom Hearts series. In fact, I have beaten every game that has been released in Europe, perhaps, that is why I like this fic, even though the writing could use a lot of work. <br><br>Sometimes it&#39;s FUN to see characters acting OOC, for comedies sake. Even actual canons do it. Generally in the form of joke endings in videogames (Like Blazblue&#39;s joke endings.) <br><br>Not every fic has to be completely serious. Not every fic has to completely follow canon. We don&#39;t spork crackfic, after all. :)</p>

            <p>&quot;Just as with any type of fanfiction, crackfic may be good or bad.<br>Some badfic authors will attempt to account for their less-than-stellar<br>work by excusing it as crackfic and saying it wasn&#39;t meant to be taken<br>seriously. Particularly bad trollfics may stray into crackfic territory.&quot;<br>This was taken from the wiki&#39;s page on crackfic. Something can be silly and fun, without the character&#39;s needing to be OOC.<br><br>I am also a fan of the Kingdom Hearts series. When I see the characters I love being made to wear Tu-tus, I get angry. (Yes that is in there.)<br><br>No, fanfiction does not have to be serious business, but canon does. Most fics <b>should</b> follow the canon.</p>

            <p>Never stop writing. I forgot how terrible and yet oddly hilarious his fics are. I&#39;m also amused by how it seems that he doesn&#39;t quite like any of his main characters, but still insists on using them and the setting. <br><br>It&#39;s like ShakespeareHemmingway, but not as &#39;gentle&#39; with it&#39;s initial mind-melting. This is more... Pan-galactic Gargle Blaster level of mind melt, rather than &#39;waking up in a tub of ice with your hope for humanity gone, and hazy memories of being on the computer all night the previous...&#39; <br><br>Teal deer: WablooSwabloo is remarkably more blunt, but ShakespeareHemmingway gets you both when you read, and again later when you stop laughing and actually think about it. <br><br>Also, Best Mini-Aragog ever: Snappledapple (Snape).

SIMBA, for glarung&#39;s sake!<br><br>The spelling and grammar are surprisingly good, but this only makes the whole thing worse.<br><br>I read an MST of this fic, which was coincidentally the ONLY MST I&#39;ve ever read where the author literally just gave up, it was so bad. Here&#39;s proof: <a href="http://heartless-fics.livejournal.com/65199.html"><a href="http://heartless-fics.livejournal.com/65199.html">http://heartless-fics.livejournal.com/65199.html</a></a> <br><br>I demand that this thing be sporked. Then burned, with an exorcist present to attend to the ashes. I mean, SHEESH! There are lines that just shouldn&#39;t be crossed, especially with Disney characters...</p>
