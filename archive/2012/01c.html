            <p>I know. I have been using fora that require a fast response, as opposed to SPaG, for years and old habits die hard.

            <p>Everybody will walk into the Hemmingway Room. It will have beige walls. It will also have a grey carpet. The mood lighting will be flat and fluorescent. The air will be cold but not too cold. Three tables and six chairs will be in the room. They will be made of wood. Everyone will sit and talk at those tables. When they talk, they will all talk like this. Nobody will reflect on anything in the Hemmingway room. Nobody will use complex syntax. The narration will depict only action and never any action more than two lines long.</p>

            <p>Alrighty, it&#39;s been a while since I first requested permission to create an agent and failed because I did it in someone else&#39;s thread, but now I&#39;ve set up my own thread and expanded on my original idea.

            <p>Phobos is responding to the overall request as I begin this, but I&#39;d like to say this to everyone, particularly the newbies:<br><br>I&#39;m getting pretty tired of seeing prospective agents pitched with half a personality, or an underdeveloped personality, or barely any personality. Granted, my own Ilraen started out that way, but there weren&#39;t a dozen other people already doing it at the time, he&#39;s from an actual badfic as opposed to a made-up one, and he wasn&#39;t in my request for permission. A permission request should show us what you can contribute to the PPC setting and make us want to read your stories. What makes us want to read about a character whose author <i>admits</i> that they haven&#39;t put in the work to make him whole? Why should we anticipate that this author is going to put in the effort to write good missions?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Responses going off-topic is fine, but I&#39;m a little worried my actual point is being missed, so here are some quotes from the last three permission requests:<br><br>ROTHY: &quot;Since he was abandoned halfway in to creation, only half of his personality actually exists, so he is currently making up the other half as he goes.&quot;<br><br>Warrior of Many Faces: &quot;The agents, seeing Sue-killing potential in her, brought her to FicPsych* where she gained a name, a somewhat more complex personality, and a mission: destroy all Sues.&quot;<br><br><i>* FicPsych cannot magically grant anyone a personality. This is a pernicious misunderstanding of the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Culture_implant">culture implant</a>.</i><br><br>Alleydodger: &quot;However, he was given very little personality beyond being grumpy or easily angered, this means he is constantly one of these two until his personality properly develops, he is slowly improving.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s not just these three—there have been plenty others before—but the fact that there are three in a row trying to do this same thing is what finally goaded me to say something about it. It&#39;s just coming off as unoriginal and lazy.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t been doing much with permission giving lately (seems like every time I check a request, it&#39;s already been answered the next day*), but I have been reading the requests as they pop up. It reminds me of a site I used to roleplay on, Steelsings. There was a lengthy sort of application form or so, for your first character to enter the RP. Most of it was standard-- name, age, appearance, occupation, Gifted** Y/N and details, and history. But although the form itself was only two-thirds of a page or so, the characters that got accepted were two pages or more in length. And most of it was personality (and history, and best of all, how the two were related). If your appearance was longer than either afore-mentioned field, the Mentors would give concrit along those lines-- at the end of every week, they&#39;d submit a list of accepted/declined characters.<br><br>I&#39;m being a bit long-winded here, but the thing is-- Steelsings was my first internet community, and the site by which I found the &#39;Board. Some people found it off-putting, how much emphasis they placed on personality, and the argument I heard most was that personalities developed with use and practice of the character-- since it was a roleplay, this was possibly more applicable there than here. But although there is a balance, and there does need to be room for character development, I maintain that the personality is <i>absolutely</i> the most important part of a character, with the history being a very close second place. Don&#39;t get me wrong, a lack of history is not an automatic Bad Thing-- it&#39;s how you handle it. &quot;She has no background because she is a bit character, so her personality is still forming,&quot; that&#39;s not okay. &quot;She was a bit character, so her background was never described; she only has a few hazy memories of a generic life to sustain her. This has made her, in some ways, a very defensive person; she takes any slight against her memory, or the way she lives, to be an attack, and reacts as such.&quot; That, on the other hand, is <i>dealing</i> with the lack of background, and how it would effect someone&#39;s mind.<br><br>Sentient beings have personalities. <i>Characters</i> have personalities. Sues/Stus don&#39;t. That&#39;s why they&#39;re so annoying-- they focus on the Speshul bits, the appearance and the unique origin, and the weaponry and the parts of a personality that are easy to show-- anger, sexual attraction, and angst. That&#39;s the hallmark of a Stu/Sue. I am really a bit annoyed at how it&#39;s becoming the hallmark of a PPC Agent, too.<br><br>For the record-- you don&#39;t have to have a traumatic fall into the PPC, or a unique experience with a plothole, or be recruited from a &#39;fic. We have at least one DoSAT agent who simply submitted an application form. You really don&#39;t need an Epic Backstory of Awesome to be an excellent and memorable character.<br><br>I know I&#39;m probably sounding harsh, here, and rambling quite a bit, but I say all this for a reason. When I started reading the PPC, and spin-offs, it was about the characters. It was about well-written interactions, reactions to canon changes, and an organization that was powered by the single most unlikely*** fuel source I know of. It wasn&#39;t about <i>OMG KILL THIS BADFIC NOWWW</i>. It was about humor, and writing, and goodfic.<br><br>It would be really, really cool if we could keep it about humor, and writing, and badfic.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>*Not that I&#39;m complaining! As long as you guys aren&#39;t buckling under the load, it&#39;s that this stuff is getting done that matters. Just, do say something, if it begins to get to you.<br>**It was a Tortall-based site. Sadly, no longer in existence, in case you were wondering.<br>***No less unlikely for having been used by <a href="http://dresdencodak.com/2010/06/03/dark-science-01/">Dresden Codak</a>.</p>

            <p>I remember my agent concepts were fairly minimalist, and I got Permission. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=206001"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=206001">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=206001</a></a>;<br><br>However, there are a few reasons I did this:<br><br>1) because I am a firm believer that there is a difference between character and backstory, and talking about  any long history for more than one sentence really would have made me feel uncomfortable. I&#39;m a big believer in &#39;the ordinary character against improbable odds&#39; as a way to encourage conflict. I described Lore simply because he was an original creature. If he had been a human or a normal species, I would have described him with one word. Lines an d lines of backstory and detail probably wouldn&#39;t convince others they were somehow and magically good characters without a sample about them, so I decided not to even bother. <br><br>2) I value simplicity. If I can&#39;t describe the concept of my characters (not their history, or their full attitude, the concept) in a few sentences or less, I don&#39;t write them. Not in any story. A simple concept I can later develop is more valuable to me than a very detailed one.<br><br>3) I frankly was not sure if anybody cared about my characters as characters. I know this sounds cold, but sharing concepts without actually sharing material to me can be a little like being that guy at the party who talks about all of the details of the things he likes regardless of anybody cares or not. I expected to be regarded in a clinical &#39;ok, these concepts are not horrible&#39; manner, and even when I wrote my missions I really didn&#39;t expect anybody to value my agents over anybody else&#39;s. I don&#39;t expect others to remember my agents in between missions. In my eyes, they came for the badfic and my agents are just a way to guide them through the badfic and give it a satisfying sporking. It&#39;s the same principle I use when I write fanfiction: if there is an OC, I don&#39;t start with the OC, because that is not who the people who came to the section walked in hoping to read about.<br><br>4) I believe writing samples speak for themselves. <br><br>I didn&#39;t consider my short blurbs as &#39;unfinished&#39; characters, or that I should never have gotten permission in the first place. I  barely even mentioned the personality of my agents at all, but there can be reasons for doing that kind of thing. And it&#39;s not always &#39;he/she didn&#39;t care enough.&#39;<br><br>Sorry, not really trying to rock the boat. Just trying to edge in with my two cents and suggest alternatives. I know I&#39;m not a PG, but I do believe that thoughtfulness and demonstration is worth a million concepts. I&#39;d really like to see more other writing offered as writing samples for the PPC in requests. I know a lot of new people aren&#39;t habitual writers... but still. To me that seems like a better proof than a long description of agents.</p>

            <p>Neshomeh is not against brevity, simplicity, or minimalism.  She is against those characters that have &quot;doesn&#39;t really have a personality&quot; as their default personality.<br><br>1) As permission givers, we don&#39;t want to know <i>everything</i> about your characters.  We just want to know enough to get a feel for who they are.<br><br>2) Nothing wrong with this. You start out with a concept, that is the important bit.<br><br>3) I am sad to say that you are partially right on this one.  There are some PPCers that don&#39;t care one bit about anyone&#39;s missions, except in regards to how terrible the badfic was.  You can see that kind of thing around here all the time; in the reviews, in the badfic threads and chat conversations that turn into &quot;that was bad, but mine is worse&quot; contests.  Some people around here just don&#39;t care what PPCers write.  They would be just as happy reading the badfic without reading a sporking, I think.<br><br>4) Writing samples are a major part of the request, but there is a reason we want to see agent profiles, as well.  If the writing sample is good, but the agents are Jack the Ripper and Cthulu, then we will likely hold off on permission.  Until we get a little more explanation of where they are going with the spin-off.  That&#39;s what the characters tell us; where is this spin-off going.<br><br>Like I said earlier, the problem is not with short agent bios.  The problem is with people taking the lazy way out by saying &quot;my agent has no personality&quot;.<br><br>I agree on this last bit, by the way.  More non-PPC writing would be great to see in permission requests.  For one thing, it makes writing a request easier, since you don&#39;t need to go to the trouble of writing a brand new piece, if you have something that already shows your writing skill.  For another thing, it gets old reading the same &quot;this is how my agents moved in to their RC&quot; story, over and over again.  Of course, some people don&#39;t have other writing samples, so writing something PPC related may be their best option.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Was not implying she was against it, she was the one that gave me permission! :D<br><br>In regards to 3 in particular, the thing is that while I noticed that unfortunate trend, I also wanted my missions to have a low &#39;entry level&#39; required for reading. Anybody should be able to pick up any mission of mine and not have to read the others to understand it. Or read much other PPC material in general. Those new readers, as you said probably don&#39;t care about my agents yet, so one of my goals to make it friendle for them and then introduce them to the agents in the course of the story.<br><br>That&#39;s the thing. I really want to see more non PPC writing because I see writing ppc missions as releasing serials. I don&#39;t write missions to tell everybody about my characters; I write missions to entertain others. The only practice that helped me with that concept is just to write for other people vs myself. I have not found a shortcut for this yet...<br><br>Not to say nonwriters can&#39;t rise to the challenge. But some stuff really is experience-based and on whole those nonwriters shouldn&#39;t worry so much about if they appease the PPC or not... they should worry about becoming a writer, even if it is just for missions.</p>

            <p>I never said that new readers don&#39;t care about agents. In fact, the some of the ones I&#39;m talking about have been around a while, and comment on many missions, but don&#39;t say anything about the mission itself.  They don&#39;t care about your agents, or mine.  They care about the badfic more than anything else in a mission, as their comments clearly show.  <br><br>That is the unfortunate trend I was talking about.<br><br>You will have to explain the &quot;releasing serials&quot; bit to me.  I am not sure how you mean that.<br><br>As for the rest, I suppose we look at these things differently.  I see my agents as the only thing that immediately sets my missions apart from the rest of them.  If I make the entry level low enough that I have to re-introduce my characters with every mission, then how are my characters supposed to grow and evolve?  I prefer to work with the idea that people are going to care about the agents and put in the effort to know their stories.  If I didn&#39;t think people were going to care, I wouldn&#39;t even bother to write.<br><br>To be honest, I&#39;m not here for the badfic.  I couldn&#39;t care less how bad a badfic is.  I am here to read about the PPC.  I am here to read about Jay and Acacia, Suicide, Nume, Trojie and Pads, Justin Agent, Techno Dann, the kitchen crew and building maintenance, Makes-Things, Luxury, and the Flowers.  I want to see hijinks, spacial craziness, and wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff.  I don&#39;t want to see a mountain of badfic with a few lines of dialogue stuck in.  If I wanted that, I would read an MST.<br><br>In my mind, the badfic is there to serve the mission, and the mission is there to serve the story and the characters.  That is reversed in a large number of recent missions: the characters and story allow there to be a mission, and the mission only serves to put the worst badfic that we can dredge up on a pedestal.<br><br>It is the difference between saying &quot;look at this story I wrote&quot; and &quot;look at this badfic I sporked.&quot;  Those are two very different things.  One is taking pride in what you have created, the other is you taking pride in destroying what someone else created.<br><br>This rambled a little more than I would have liked, and not all of it is directed at you, Aster.

Sorry, that may have gotten brevity&#39;d into existence... I was writing on my phone at the time.  But yeah, I am talking about what you are talking about.<br><br>Releasing &#39;serials&#39;: I&#39;m publishing these on the PPC for others to read and enjoy, sort of like a serial or a short story is released in a magazine. The enjoyment of others is at the front of my mind when I write something rather than my enjoyment in writing it. Of course, I DO have a lot of fun doing it... but there&#39;s a big difference between &#39;I wrote this for me to write&#39; vs. &#39;I wrote this for others to read.&#39;<br><br>So when I think enjoyment, I think &#39;stuff that caters to the reader rather than myself&#39; which is why I try and keep my agents (while not generic) but fairly simple so the focus can be on the PPC in general, the badfic itself (because many people do read for the badfic) and on the way the agents handle it rather than their personas in general. <br>While they do have personal lives and characterizations of their own, the enjoyment of the reader is more important to me: I am fairly sure nobody cares about Aster in particular, really. They care that she&#39;s a PPC agent, that she gets into wacky PPC hijinks. (I hope!)<br><br>As I said, my OC rule: when people read fanfic, they didn&#39;t come there with an OC in mind. They came there with the canon in mind. And so that&#39;s how I see the PPC. When I read and write PPC material, I didn&#39;t do it for my particular agent, and I didn&#39;t do it for the particular badfic. Nobody knows or really cares about the fate of either one. I like to think I write missions because I like writing PPC materials, and that people want to read missions for the same reason.<br><br></p>

            <p>I read PPC stories for the PPC. To me that means the characters, their stories, the craziness of the atmosphere in the PPC and then the mission. This is also the way I write my spin-off. Maybe some people won&#39;t read it like this, but my goal is to make these characters people. People with hopes, dreams, thoughts, interactions. People with friends and dates and things that they do on their downtime. There are some spin-offs that are written completely opposite of this. You can almost literally pick up a mission anywhere in their list and read it. Being written like this doesn&#39;t mean I think they are not well-written, but they still don&#39;t hold as much interest for me as the ones who have more character focus.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t mean there&#39;s no character focus. In short, what I mean is to avoid the you-picked-up-the-novel-halfway-through feeling. At no time during my writing should anybody feel like they missed something. Not even when it&#39;s a canon they don&#39;t know. <br><br>Of course, I&#39;m not perfect. But I try.</p>

            <p>is to sort of do both with my spinoff.  I definitely have plans for my characters that will continue throughout my spinoff.  But at the same time, the badfic should still be the focus of the middle part of the mission, because part of the PPC is protecting canon, and the badfic is the antagonist in that equation.  The way I see it,  has three parts to its setting: the actual PPC HQ, the canon worlds and characters we protect, and the physical badfic characteristics the agents must wade through.  For my missions, I want to make sure all four things (characters, HQ, badfic, canon) get some focus.</p>

            <p>Frankly, the badfic itself holds next to zero interest for me after all the years I&#39;ve been here. The thing about badfic is that it&#39;s pretty much all the same, so what&#39;s interesting to me about missions is how the PPCer spins it. I don&#39;t really care that someone distorted the distance between points A and B again. I do care if it squishes the agents, or makes them puke, or gives them a headache, or trips them up, etc. I want to watch these characters struggle through the horrible and hilarious things the bad writing is doing, and feel for them. If I don&#39;t click with the agents, I&#39;m not likely to keep reading the spin-off.<br><br>&#39;Course, for my own missions, I do normally strive to find badfic that has a little something extra to set it apart—it&#39;s one reason I take so long between missions. The likes of &quot;Ring Child&quot; and &quot;The Girl And Her Dragon&quot; don&#39;t come along every day, and thank goodness. The latter&#39;s grammar actually traumatized me. I cannot see the word &quot;as&quot; in a sentence without cringing. I can barely even use it anymore. &gt;.<br>... Erm. Anyway. I also strive to pick badfic that will poke my agents in new and different ways, to promote character development. Both of my spin-offs are 100% about the agents and their personal struggles. I try not to dwell too much in their heads, and let their words and actions do most of the talking instead, but that&#39;s what I write for. Like Phobos said, the badfic serves the mission, and the mission serves the characters.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I am of course still rather new to the whole PPC-thing, but at this point I look at my missions as a kind of &#39;Monster of the Week&#39; series, with the badfic being the monster.<br>I then try to make the mission about my agents and their characters by showing how they react to elements in the badfic and how they react to each other. Just like the best &#39;Monster of the Week&#39; series are about so much more than just showing of a new creature-concept, I want my missions to be the same. That&#39;s my goal, anyway.<br>But I am planning to incorporate character growth in the form of a small story arch, spanning multiple missions. (Stay tuned!)<br><br>And I only spork badfics that I think are absolutely horrific, but that&#39;s because I simply wouldn&#39;t have the heart to do it otherwise.</p>

            <p>Do I even have to say that I write more for the PPC and my agents than the badfic? Probably yes, actually, considering that many of you don&#39;t read my spinoff. :p <br><br>Still, I like my numbered missions to be accessible from any point, although they are part of a continuing story. (There&#39;s actually supposed to be hints at the backstory revealed in &#39;Mission ?&#39; in a few places (my third and fourth missions, largely), but I dunno if that comes through. Ah well...) If you care to find out more and get into the continuing story, then you can read the interludes, including a couple that have nothing to do with missions. If you just read every new mission posted on the board, that works, too. Or at least, that&#39;s the goal. <br><br>Yeah, I probably could have said &#39;I like Aster&#39;s idea&#39; on this one; although I am perfectly willing to write stuff that is a direct sequel to something else I wrote that requires prior reading if the sequel is NOT A MISSION- notably, &#39;Rule Number Three&#39; follows &#39;Coffee Rain,&#39; and an Interlude I collabed on with Nesh that&#39;s currently in beta is a continuation of that story arch. This ties directly into my next point.<br><br>As for writing for yourself versus others- I write missions for others, not that I don&#39;t love writing them, but Interludes and other non mission things I write largely because I want to write about these characters. I&#39;m aware that there is a lot more interest in a mission than in a character development interlude about Orken. (Like my last interlude.) Of course, I want them to turn out well and for them to make sense, and I always do want my readers to like them. And hey, if there are people out there who actually care as much as I do, that&#39;s awesome. </p>

            <p>On the whole &#39;author who admits they haven&#39;t put much work into their stuff&#39;, I actually have a bit to say about that.<br><br>It&#39;s happened quite a bit in some of the badfic I&#39;ve found laying around in the Pit. Perhaps most notably, this was one of my biggest issues with the fic I sporked in my fifth Floaters mission (&quot;Careful The Tale You Tell&quot;, which can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1OyjfWKA_-b8wONh7ggdtvqv_UbJjY_qG76vYwoDTkZE"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1OyjfWKA_-b8wONh7ggdtvqv_UbJjY_qG76vYwoDTkZE">https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1OyjfWKA_-b8wONh7ggdtvqv_UbJjY_qG76vYwoDTkZE</a></a> ), wherein the author admitted this <i>in the fic&#39;s very first A/N</i>:<br><br>&quot;Please excuse my grammar and spelling, I extremely bad at writing but I just got an idea for a FanFics and I know if I don&#39;t do it I will go crazy about it...&quot;<br><br>As soon as I read that A/N, I asked the same question Neshomeh is now: Why should we care about something that the author him/herself can&#39;t be bothered to care enough about to put some actual effort into it?<br><br>I think that this is a common issue in some of the less awful pieces of badfic: the concepts were interesting, but somewhere the execution got bungled, either because they didn&#39;t have the experience to make their concept work, or they just don&#39;t care. I find it difficult to relate to the people who just don&#39;t care.</p>

            <p>To be honest, your writing sample appears rushed.  It is flat, humorless, and lacking in description.  Your agents show some potential, but they lose all of it in the sample, as well.

            <p>You&#39;re asking for permission, but you don&#39;t want to write for the PPC? You just want to create agents for others to use, and for them to work out the stories you&#39;ve worked into their background?<br><br>That just doesn&#39;t work. We are not a community designed entirely around the pleasing and entertaining of others. We write primarily for <i>ourselves</i>, which means we use our own characters, our own ideas, and our own methods first, because that is what is pleasing to us. It is already difficult enough to encourage people to use characters that already exist for general use that do not belong to them, but already fill a niche! It is not pleasing to anyone to use someone else&#39;s characters at <i>their</i> behest with all that that would entail. <br><br>You cannot and should not assume that because we are writers we will happily adopt your characters and write out everything you thought up for them, because, in all likelihood, no one will, and if someone did, it would probably not be happily. Saying as you did here that you want other people to use your characters with no personal intents of writing them at all is quite galling and rude. <br><br>I don&#39;t intend to come off as harsh as this post might read, but there&#39;s really no way to couch it politely; expecting others to do the work of writing your characters for you is rude and disrespectful. </p>

            <p>1) Collaborating is okay—lots of PPCers have written in teams, including Jay and Acacia—but you&#39;d still need permission. And someone would have to agree to do it, of course.<br><br>2) I&#39;m not quite sure how to address trying to get permission to write while self-professing yourself as not being able to, so I&#39;ll try two ways:<br><br>2.1) If you&#39;d like to <i>learn</i> how to write better, I suggest two things. First, read. Read all the time. Read a lot. Read things that sound like the kind of things you&#39;d like to write, to see how it&#39;s done. Then, second, write. Write all the time. Write a lot. Write things that you&#39;d love to read—but there&#39;s no need to post these things where everyone can see them unless you&#39;re happy with them. It&#39;s perfectly fine to write for the drawer/hard drive until you&#39;ve gained some confidence.<br><br>2.2) You don&#39;t have to write stuff to hang out here. You&#39;re more than welcome to just hang out and talk to us as a reader. Preferably more stuff than just &quot;AUGH THIS BADFIC IS SO BAD,&quot; &#39;cause that gets dull, but heck, if that&#39;s what tickles your fancy, whatever.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So there is a particular fanfiction in the Pit that has 1k+ reviews and is immensely popular. The actual writing style and SPaG is very good, it&#39;s easy to read, and the writer is a fun, quirky person. The only problem is, the characters are extremely OOC and it is an AU. The author even admits to this in the first chapter. She basically created her own characters and tacked the real character&#39;s names and appearances onto them. So my question is, is this a badfic?<br><br></p>

            <p>A good question.  Let&#39;s examine what you&#39;ve told us, and see if we can find an answer.<br><br><b><u>Pros</u></b><br>Good writing style<br>Good SPaG<br>Easy to Read<br><br><b><u>Cons</u></b><br>OOCness<br><br><b><u>Neutral</u></b><br>Author is fun and quirky<br>Fic is an AU<br><br>Looks to me like the Pros far outweigh the Cons.  I can&#39;t say for sure that it is badfic but, even if it is, it is probably not bad enough to spork.  We aren&#39;t looking for fics that are just a little bad, after all.<br><br>As a side note, I put AU under Neutral because I sometimes hear people use it as a negative when talking about a fic, but there is nothing inherently wrong with an AU.  It is a genre.  Genres are neither good or bad.  They simply are.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Another big part of the sporking selection process is effort. Many of the fics that get PPC&#39;d clearly have no effort whatsoever put into them, in terms of SPaG and closeness to canon. In your opinion, did the author put a lot of effort into the fic?<br><br>Also, Popularity =/= Quality. I&#39;ve seen loads of lazy, badly written, or disturbing fanfics that don&#39;t have a single negative review.<br><br>Thirdly, and most importantly, would it be funny? That&#39;s probably the main deciding factor. Would it be funny to spork it? Could you get a lot of jokes out of it, or at the very least a lot of development for your own characters?</p>

            <p>Is the fic enjoyable to read?<br><br>Badfic is badfic because it isn&#39;t written well. (Yeah, a Captain Obvious). If the story all in itself is good, then it isn&#39;t a badfic.<br><br>Take Shadow Cristal Mage&#39;s &quot;Nanoha Takamachi of 2814&quot;. OOCness is rampant, but the story is really well written. Yeah, it&#39;s a crackfic, but it has also an overarching plot. A truly masterpiece.<br><br>The two major warning bells of a badfic are bad grammar and flimsy plot. (For example, the one I posted just under this has a few holes in the plot, and a not-so-stellar grammar), and by your review that&#39;s not the case. </p>

            <p>While looking for a good Card Captor Sakura crossover to read I stumbled upon this thing:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746443/1/Harry_Potter_And_The_Elemental_Master"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746443/1/Harry_Potter_And_The_Elemental_Master">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746443/1/Harry_Potter_And_The_Elemental_Master</a></a><br><br>A crossover with Harry Potter. Not unusual (<i>everything</i> is crossed over multiple times with HP) and not excessively bad, but it seems to have a great fun potential (In fact, just by reading it I half-plotted out a mission, as there were some situations that just begged for Agents commenting on it). And if there is a problem with my spinoff, is exactly the lack of truly humorous situations.<br><br>The main &quot;charges&quot; for now (as only two chapters have been written) are unexplained situations (just how the hell did Sakura and Tomoyo end up guests at Harry&#39;s house? And from when Tomoyo has magic?) and the fact that the grammar still needs a lot of work even if this story seems to have a beta</p>

            <p>Well, I certainly see what you mean about the charges. I don&#39;t know Card Captor Sakura all that well.<br><br>As of now, though, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s of sufficient length to be sporked. It looks like it has problems, but at present not enough of them to justify a sporking. This is one reason I tend to wait a bit for fics I want to make missions out of: I want to be sure that I get to feature the juiciest charge material possible.<br><br>So for that reason, I second EF&#39;s motion that you wait just a little bit.

            <p>Some of you may recall the Eliminators of the Enemies of Canon (or EEC) that I broached the idea of in a previous thread. For those of you who don’t, it is an organization that recruits OCs from across the multiverse to kill Sues. The problem is that they bring people from, say, the Metroid canon into something like Lord of the Rings, messing up canon almost as badly as the Sues they kill. As such, they must be disciplined, one way or the other, and my agents, Zoe and the Answer (Department of Mary Sues, Video Game Division, specializing in Pokйmon), are the (un)lucky pair the Flowers assigned to do it, having been the first agents to encounter the EEC.<br>Zoe Whittaker is a bit character minion from a Pokйmon badfic, who initially didn’t even have a name. Her only role was to have her Kadabra try to interrogate the Sue telepathically and watch as it died from psychic backlash. Her desire for revenge kept her going, but unfortunately, the PPC got to the Sue before she did. Enraged, she attacked the agents for robbing her of her revenge, but after several minutes of finding out why one never meddles with the affairs of assassins, she eventually lost consciousness. The agents, seeing Sue-killing potential in her, brought her to FicPsych where she gained a name, a somewhat more complex personality, and a mission: destroy all Sues. Zoe’s new personality hasn’t changed much about her; instead of being angry all the time, now she’s usually pessimistic, cynical, and angry. She’s also a very solitary person, despite her partner’s best efforts to get her to lighten up. She favors poison as an assassination method, using Pokйmon canon poisons, World 1 poisons, or Ye Olde Poisonous Poison, depending on her mood.<br>The Answer is a far more unusual case. DC-verse Anansi, who owns all tales, is naturally aware of the Sue problem, and tried to create a species that was designed specifically to hunt Sues. The Answer was his first attempt, but a particularly bad DC/Pokйmon crossover crackfic that was passing by was absorbed into the Answer, simultaneously weakening his abilities and imbuing him with an extreme aptitude for randomness and eccentricity. Anansi, considering the Answer a failure, jettisoned him into the space between multiverses and left him there, only to find that he could not make anything even remotely as useful as the Answer was. However, by then, the Answer had multiverse-hopped his way to the PPC and joined up, as he still had an instinctual urge to get rid of Sues. However, he found himself physically unable to so much as lift a hand against a Sue, despite being able to sense their presence and predict their moves to an extent. However, due to staffing shortages, the Marquis got around this handicap by simply making sure to keep him partnered with someone who didn’t mind killing all the Sues they encountered. The Answer displays many irrational behaviors, such as creating his own religion which revolves around TV Tropes, irritating heavily-armed Agents, and munching on extra pronunciation when in badfics, but he has shown competence in Sue-hunting and has been in the PPC for at least two years without once going to Medical. He does tend to drive his partners Flamethrower Crazy after a while, however, so the Marquis often ends up having to reassign his partners somewhere less stressful.<br>The Answer, as mentioned above, has the ability to sense a Sue’s location (which is not overly useful, since the Words perform much the same function) and the ability to anticipate and dodge the attacks of most Sues (which is far more useful).<br>His Pokйmon are low-leveled, since the Sues would just be better than him in battling automatically regardless of how strong they are. His team consists of Ambush Bug the Kricketune, a serial breaker of the fourth wall; Mxyzptlk the Misdreavus, who prefers to torment people by messing with their dreams and perceptions; Batzarro the Crobat, who says the opposite of what he means and lacks a firm grasp on grammar; Glomulus the Munchlax, who is actually rather typical for a Munchlax in that he’s a glutton; Creeper the Aipom, who finds morbid subjects funny; and Plastic Man the Ditto, who tends to crush on any desirable females in the area.<br>I apologize for the fact that this went on so long, but I’ve thought this out a lot and the information here all seemed relevant.<br>As their first mission, I intend to have them take on this fic: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7504579/1/Alexs_Contest_Chronicles"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7504579/1/Alexs_Contest_Chronicles">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7504579/1/Alexs_Contest_Chronicles</a></a><br>Very very bad fic.<br>And so that you know that I’m not secretly working for the Suethors: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBBKfSvEeWlKYtVXuhVY051pxcvi17VCXravvNKe-zA/edit?hl=en_US"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBBKfSvEeWlKYtVXuhVY051pxcvi17VCXravvNKe-zA/edit?hl=en_US">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBBKfSvEeWlKYtVXuhVY051pxcvi17VCXravvNKe-zA/edit?hl=en_US</a></a>#<br>Thank you for your time.<br></p>

            <p>Your character is a Mary Sue.<br><br>TV Tropes has no set definition of what a Mary Sue is, so here is ours, from the wiki:<br><br>&quot;A Mary Sue is a fictional character that achieves its goals in the story with minimal effort, out of proportion to what the audience would expect given the setting(s), culture(s), and other inhabitants of that universe. In order to accomplish this, a Mary Sue will have character traits heavily skewed in favor of outstanding attributes vs. significant flaws. This character type is mostly associated with fanfiction, though it can be found in original fiction as well.&quot;<br><br>In your story, the main character smirks in the face of danger, mouths off to authority with no repercussions, is constantly pleased with himself, points out where everyone else is wrong and gets away with it, has a Sooper Speshul ability (he is even called &quot;Gifted&quot; with a capital G), is blatantly superior to everyone else in the room, accomplishes his goal of escaping (and even kidnapping the Queen-to-be) with no real effort, and anyone who stands in his way is ripe for pain or humiliation.<br><br>Please do not try to tell me that the random thoughts in his head constitute a &quot;flaw,&quot; since they do not, in fact, hinder his efforts or goals in any way.<br><br>You can&#39;t get much more of a Marty Stu than that.<br><br>And if you are tempted to reply with, &quot;Well there&#39;s a <i>reason</i> for him to be like this [insert explanation here]!&quot; please keep in mind that a) no justification for these absurd and overblown traits was forthcoming from the writing sample itself, b) stories should not have to be explained in order to work, and c) your unwillingness to see the Stu for what he is is a perfect example of why the Mary Sue is such a tenacious pest.<br><br>In addition to your writing sample, I noticed further down on the Board that you didn&#39;t think Eragon, one of the most spectacular Sues in existence, was in fact a Mary Sue. Put together, these posts illustrate that you do not know how to recognize a Mary Sue, in your own work or in the work of others. Your grammar and spelling are sound, but you are not ready to write for the PPC.<br><br>Sorry for the disappointment,<br><br>Araeph</p>

            <p>It *does* look like I need more work recognizing Sues. Not much to say about that.<br><br>Sorry about the line breaks. XP<br><br>Actually, based on your comments, I might reconsider writing for the PPC at all. One of the things you mentioned was that I had put more plot than humor into the humor-based PPC. I happen to rather like intricate plots, which are not so easily welded into the PPC.

            <p>First of all, your paragraphs need lines between them to make for easier reading. Both this page and your writing sample look like one long, unending paragraph. If you do not wish to have lines breaks, then you need to indent your paragraphs, as in a printed book.<br><br>Now, onto the characterization of your agents.<br><br>The PPC&#39;s base is <i>humor</i>. Nothing about your EEC idea or your characters tells me there would be humor in your spin-off. Zoe Whittaker&#39;s angst-ridden past is not humor. The Answer&#39;s &quot;irrational behavior&quot; isn&#39;t humor. (&#39;Lol random&#39; as actual humor is incredibly difficult to pull off.)<br><br>Zoe&#39;s background and personality is utterly antithetical to the tone of the PPC; the PPC is not based off of rage and malice, and it has no patience for agents who wallow in their own misery. The Answer&#39;s background is more interesting, but so focused on making his character bizarre and eccentric that he&#39;s bound to put the readers off a little, especially those who are new to your PPC work.<br><br>I can tell that you spent a lot of time on the backstory, but nothing you created there seems like it would contribute in a positive way to the Canon Protection Initiative. If agents&#39; backstories are needed, they are there to a) help them fit better into the world of the PPC, or b) to help the readers sympathize with them better. Neither one of those is true in this case.<br><br>For an example of a better way to approach this, suppose you created an agent who came from a badfic, and as a result had <i>too much</i> backstory to remember properly. The realistic results of this are that his memory of where he came from is constantly changing and contradicting itself. Sometimes it gets him down, but most of the times it&#39;s just a bit embarrassing, and it&#39;s also a good ice-breaker for introducing himself in the PPC Cafeteria. These conflicting backstories would not be a random conglomeration of dialogue that could come from a generator, or an excuse to have him infused with multiple personalities. Rather, they would be the result of one brain trying to interpret two or three coherent, yet contradictory sets of information.<br><br>I should mention that you have a good grasp of spelling, grammar, and sentence structure. I would recommend reading more spin-offs and MSTs (perhaps in the Sue-mocking communities) before attempting to get Permission. This is even more the case considering your writing sample, which I will get to in the next post.<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>I looked around and couldn&#39;t find this story anywhere on the lists of claimed or unclaimed badfic, which shocked me. (Please forgive me if it&#39;s on there and I missed it, or if it used to be on there and was deleted.) So I decided to try and post it. This is the MSTed version of &quot;Rosemarylln and her story,&quot; a PJO fanfic:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6788091/1/Rosemarylln_and_her_story_COMMENTED"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6788091/1/Rosemarylln_and_her_story_COMMENTED">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6788091/1/Rosemarylln_and_her_story_COMMENTED</a></a><br><br>For those who are curious: the original fic was posted sometime last summer by an individual called &quot;bejealousofme.&quot; It went on for, I don&#39;t know, thirteen chapters or so, and generated a MASSIVE amount of flames. It also somehow got three parodies. Around the thirteenth chapter, Mr./Ms. bejealousofme broke down, admitted to being a troll, and deleted the fic. All that remains of its former glory is this MSTed version.<br><br>I know it should be burned with fire, but when I was reading the original, un-MSTed version, I laughed so hard I almost hurt myself. Anyway, here you go.</p>

            <p>To be fair, it was a Mary-Slash-Possession-Replacement-Copy-Troll, and I&#39;m not sure my Agents recognized it as such because one was brand-new and it was in the other&#39;s home fandom, therefore she was too pissy to think for most of the time, but still. </p>

            <p>SECRET AGENTS<br><br><br><i>O&#39;Neil, who had spent the last several hour</i><br><br><i>Orken, who was busy sorting through the contents of his backpack, rolled his eyes. &quot;Yes, Agent Thomas, Agent Ilraen is an Andalite. I congratulate you for noticing that, and not letting your desire to greet him and invite him in get in the way. You know, silly things like manners.&quot;</i><br><br> I loved this bit of sarcasm. It&#39;s like Orken at his best. The kind of thing that makes me want to read more about him.<br><br><br><i>&quot;If you wish to give up the notebook and continue your self-injury, Agent Ilraen is willing to note down charges.&quot;</i>  <br><br>This line made me laugh.<br><br><br><br>(This next section is pretty round about, but I think it works. It really did take me a long time to figure out what it was that was bugging me, and I thought maybe the process would be of some use. This was pretty hard to put my finger on, so it truly is a subtle thing. If I wasn&#39;t trying very hard to give some concrit here, I probably never would have mentioned it or given it enough thought to figure out what unsettled me.)<br><br>The argument between Ilraen and Orken felt off to me. I think I am supposed to be getting that Orken cares, but isn&#39;t wanting to show it. It was working, sort of, up until Thomas intervened. Then it just felt like Orken got to get off the hook with being pompous. He did apologize of course, but--I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t pin point it exactly--the scene just left me feeling like Orken is a dick, but that I should be feeling that Orken is a Jerk with a Heart of Gold. It does get better at the wrap-up when they talk about it, but it still feels...forced? I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not being more helpful here.<br><br>Orken kind of comes off a bit for the worse with O&#39;Neil, too. <br><br><i>&quot;If there was some way to communicate with him, things would be simpler. As it is, we have to guess. It isn&#39;t anything urgent, I assure you. We keep him well fed and he has free range of Thomas&#39; side of the response center. </i><br><br>He just seems so...dismissive. Like if O&#39;Neil&#39;s physical needs have been met that he isn&#39;t important enough to matter beyond that, so why bother trying to understand, or even give the mini some sympathy and understanding over the problem.<br><br>Actually, this might be part of the problem I had with their argument. Like, I know that Orken is scared that Thomas could go insane, so I know he cares and worries from the mission where Thomas OD&#39;d and from the mission where his former partner did go insane. I know that&#39;s a real thing for Orken. In the argument none of his side feels like it is coming from there.<br><br><i>Orken shrugged. &quot;He never asked for Bleeprin, and for the next couple weeks he can&#39;t have any, anyway. This seemed to keep him from doing anything too stupid—he has a thick head and has never done more than split it open a bit, and it&#39;s less likely to alert a Sue than him yelling about vegetables and Roman emperors. It isn&#39;t like he&#39;s slamming his head into things full force.&quot;</i><br><br>He makes mention of the previous incidents there, but I have this image in my head of someone who is standing there with a totally unconcerned look on his face, speaking in an unconcerned tone of voice, stating facts that are kind of distant from his caring. Maybe it is the shrug? Because of knowing more about Orken&#39;s past with insane partners, I feel like he should be reacting. At the same time I know he isn&#39;t the type to just start hugging and crying about it, but maybe if there was some observational note, like made by Ilraen or even Thomas (who is in much better position to know that Orken isn&#39;t as cool with insanity in partners as he seems). <br><br>Like Orken is being an unreliable narrator here, in my mind, but nothing in the text supports that, so I&#39;ve gotten a dissonance. I think that is finally it. It took me a long while to work it out. It wasn&#39;t a huge one, or it would have been more obvious to me, but I think that is what I&#39;ve been trying to get at.<br><br><br><i>He sighed. Apparently this was how the multiverse rewarded agents who thought they were ready for more responsibility. Ilraen had never seen a public service announcement, but just then he could have written one.</i><br><br>Best line ever! <br><br><br><br>COSMIC LOVE<br><br><i>Sar-Plasm™ started to ooze from the walls.</i>  <br><i>The Minbari looked at the goo on the walls. &quot;Intern Bjшrnsen, please inform Janitorial that Agent Supernumerary has been to visit. They will want to clean this up before it dries.&quot;</i> <br>Random Fruit Cart-hahahahahaha. this line reminds that I need to work on more randomly hilarious moments. This is the PPC, of course there has to be a fruitcart involved in a chase. Thanks for this one.<br><br><br><i>Nume carefully plucked her arms away from him, wearing a look associated with removing an old banana peel that hadn&#39;t quite made it into the trash the first time. </i><br><br>Very nice description there.<br><br>I&#39;ve read the other comments that said that Nume took the killing curse too well, but to me, he seems to take it very Nume-like. To me, Decima takes it awfully well. She seems more excitable than Nume, but basically doesn&#39;t comment on it. It could very well be a calm in the moment fall apart later kind of reaction, but she&#39;s still holding it together pretty well through the end of the mission.<br><br>I kind of like how Nume is more rattled by the loss of the RA than he immediately was over Decima most likely being dead. I&#39;d say he could have been more surprised about her being alive than he was, but that could be part of his general not caring.<br><br>I have to say that you write the best jerk character I&#39;ve read in the PPC. Especially since I don&#39;t really get the Jerk With a Heart of Gold vibe from Nume, more straight-up misanthrope. They definitely aren&#39;t easy to write.<br><br>I thought the magic through the plothole was inspired.<br><br>Loved the ending. Decima is not going to let Nume off easy over the closet incident is she? I look forward to their future meetings.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s revealed that she&#39;s not dead a bit before it&#39;s revealed why. I&#39;m nitpicking, but you must have reacted to her not being dead before the RA even came up, so I&#39;m wondering when exactly the disappointment set in, and whether the bit where they might&#39;ve been trapped had any impact at all.<br><br>Also... you expected Nume to cry?

            <p>I might have misphrased my comment. What I was trying to say is that when Decima was hit with the AK, it was a very emotional &quot;Oh no! She&#39;s dead,&quot; moment. Then, Nume started reacting as if Decima was actually dead and the situation was very tense. After it turned out that Decima was all right, it felt like the climax of the story was over and the mission would be finishing up.<br><br>A short while later, I found out that the curse had hit the RA, and then the suspense went right back up. The way y&#39;all wrote that was very good, and I called the climax a &quot;letdown&quot; because it seemed like the resolution was coming and then it, well, didn&#39;t. After reading that over again today, I realised that it was actually a very interesting twist from a narrative point of view. <br><br>Also, the &quot;Decima&#39;s not dead&quot; revelation wasn&#39;t a &quot;letdown&quot;. I was just shocked because &quot;Wait?! She survived a Killing Curse? How did she DO that?&quot; and I had a feeling that there was a DEM coming on.<br><br>And yes, I was expecting some sort of sadness from Nume if it had turned out that Decima was dead. Maybe not tears, but definitely an emotional reaction.<br></p>

            <p>That&#39;s a lot more specific, and thus more helpful. The actual emotional impact we&#39;re having on a reader (or readers) is what we consider the real test of the writing.

            <p>I&#39;m sorry that you were let down by the climax.  We set out to kill the RA and that seemed to be the way that worked the best, as well as being in character for Vampire!Luna.

            <p>I enjoyed reading this, Nume and Decima are pretty good together, though I doubt they think so! :P<br><br>As always, I really liked when an agent was talkign with a Flower, and Nume&#39;s talk with the Lichen was one of my favorites. And Reading Decima&#39;s session with Mirrad (Who I forgot was a male &gt;.&gt;;) was funny too. I like it when people use Fic Psyche for more then just mentions. Oh! And the slipper! :D<br><br><br>Yeah, reading agents doing things with other people aside from partners  before or after a Mission is always fun. Though, the chase scene was really good. So, I guess agents doing stuff aside from a Mission can be fun. Good idea with the stand too, I got a good smile out of that.<br><br>&#39;three jagger like scars&#39;  Just... Mick Jagger. I can&#39;t say anything else about how great that was.<br><br>As for questions/nitpicks, I was confused for a second over the fic bits not being bolded, but that is really just a personal preference. It was still really easy to tell the fic bits apart from the Mission text, so no real biggie.<br><br>With that said, though, I would have liked to have seen some more fic bits. Specifically, the babies name. It took me a minute to try and figure out what it could be, and I am still not really sure. <br><br>As for the Killing Curse bit, I went to the Wiki to see if it was even possible. I always assumed that the Killing Curse was bigger then what it is. Like, a small wave or something. my Suspension of Disbelief wasn&#39;t really stretched too much by it, but I did find it really odd that there wasn&#39;t more amazement/unbelievibleness over her that narrowly avoiding sure death. <br><br>Altogether, I really, really liked reading it. It didn&#39;t seem too long, and had more stuff then just the mission. <br><br>I look forward to more from Decima!<br><br>-not sure why the killing curse didn&#39;t kill Decima, not strong enough? Hmm, kinda agree with PC that it is kinda weird. I always thought that it couldn&#39;t be blocked by somethign so small, and that the killign curse was not a bolt?<br>-</p>

            <p>First off, thanks for taking the time to post this.  It is much appreciated.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the events before the mission.  Those were a lot of fun to write.  Using the existing Fic Psych characters is something that I would encourage everyone to do.  They are there to give characters an excuse to talk.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry the fic bits not being in bold was confusing for you.  I am glad, however, that we were able to make it clear through the writing.<br><br>The baby&#39;s name was displayed on the CAD at one point.  Were there other places you would have liked to see fic bits?<br><br>As for the Killing Curse, I always heard it was a green light.  Nothing big or overtly monstrous, which is why it was always creepy.<br><br>Thinking back, you are right.  There could have been more reaction to the near death experience.  I&#39;m not sure what that would look like, though, as both of the characters tend to bottle up their more negative emotions.  Good note, though.<br><br>Normally I would agree that a small object wouldn&#39;t stop a Killing Curse.  We were operating under the assumption that the object in question had a simple kind of life.  The curse killed the first life it hit, which was the RA.  We really didn&#39;t explain that in the mission because the characters wouldn&#39;t think of it (though Decima might, after some study).<br><br>Glad to hear you like Decima.  She&#39;ll be back, and next time she might even get a permanent partner.</p>

            <p>Supernumerary and Decima make a surprisingly good agent pair/team (although I suspect Nume was being more reserved than he normally would because he knew the end of working with Decima was in sight; I doubt he would bite his tongue quite so much if they were permanent partners).  I also liked seeing the beginning of a story arc with Decima and her difficulties in accomplishing exorcisms.<br><br>I would have liked to see more quotes from the badfic in the &quot;Cosmic Love&quot; mission.

            <p>The bit with Decima in Fic Psych was to continue the character arc from her first mission.  It really affected her when that wraith broke out of the circle.

            <p>As an example of a place where a quote would have helped, look at this paragraph:<br><br>&quot;The agents were surprised about one thing that happened. Bella made a comment about the people of Forks calling Van Helsing if they ever found out how many vampires, werewolves, and wizards were living there.&quot;<br><br>Starting out with telling us the agents were surprised, then narrating the dialogue in question before showing the agents&#39; reactions really pulls some of the energy out of the scene (for me anyway; I realize this is kind of a personal preference).  I just feel it would have been more fun to read if we readers had gotten the line (the surprisingly clever line, as the agents pointed out) out of the blue, and then been able to react to it at the same time as the agents.  Am Imaking sense?  Y/N?<br><br>A note about Miss MacKinnon.  I&#39;ve recently been rethinking my recruiting of her, since she really doesn&#39;t feel like an avergae character out of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>.  I originally based her personality around being the polar opposite of the Sue&#39;s description, but now she just feels out of place to me.  Oh well.

            <p>I thank you for the typo catch, and I&#39;ll be fixing that ASAP, but I really can&#39;t figure out what you&#39;re talking about, regarding Voldemort. His name comes up a few times in the mission, but it&#39;s not like he does anything.

            <p>I hashed most of my thoughts on this mission out with Phobos in the IRC, but he asked me to put them up on the Board as well.<br><br>First off, some positive notes. Numa and Decima have some wonderful moments together, and the dialogue between them is very well done. The action scenes are well-paced and easy to follow.<br><br>I had a minor quibble with the lack of direct quotations from the badfic itself. Now, those who know me are aware of my dislike regarding big blocks of directly quoted badfic. However, this particular mission goes too far in the opposite direction. There are points - usually direct shout-outs to something mentioned in the text which would have been improved if the audience were allowed to read what the text actually said. It is a fine line between too much and too little quoting.<br><br><b><u>SPOILERS BEGIN HERE</u></b><br><br>I should probably also mention a minor problem I had that Phobos was able to explain away: how, after the mission, Draco was able to Apparate everyone from the Twilight setting to Harry Potter&#39;s UK. I had thought that this was impossible (Apparating between continuums, I mean) until it was explained to me that the two realities were still crossed over at the time. I accepted that.<br><br>My largest issue with this mission, however, still stands. I was stunned (and not in a good way) when Decima&#39;s Remote Activator blocked the power of the Killing Curse and saved her life. The entire sequence smacked of convenience and Deus ex Machina. While it may be true that some of the technology in the PPC might be a bit sentient, this is never directly said or even suggested to be the case in this situation. It felt like a very obvious cheat to set up the remainder of the story and the epilogue when Nume and Ilraen reunite.<br><br>If I might widen my gaze for a brief moment, I&#39;ve noticed events like this in more and more recent missions: that is, agents almost but not quite dying. Having this happen on occasion isn&#39;t a problem. A bit of action-related drama can really do wonders for a mission. However, it begins to strain credulity to the point of nonsense when agents from all over are able to just narrowly avoid death.<br><br>All in all, this had the potentiality to be a very good mission. However, the DeM right at the climatic moment really did drag this one down for me.</p>

            <p>First, thanks for taking the time to put this up. As I believe Phobos said, a well-rounded review is always worth being seen. {= )<br><br>Re. direct quotations, were there any spots in particular you could point out, for reference? If we didn&#39;t clearly portray what was going on, there&#39;s definitely a problem there; but if we did, I&#39;m not so sure. I don&#39;t want to make anyone have to read the badfic personally to know what we&#39;re talking about, but if a paraphrase does the work, why quote? People do have the option of looking at the badfic if it&#39;s just a matter of curiosity.<br><br><b>SPOILERS AHOY!</b><br><br>Bleh, I didn&#39;t know there was an almost-dying trend going on. I sympathize; we could&#39;ve broken the RA some other way if we&#39;d known. {= /<br><br>Since it is what it is, though, I do have to disagree that the RA is a deus ex machina. Typically, these save the day through some magical-seeming means that wasn&#39;t previously established, when the author has obviously written herself into a corner that wasn&#39;t planned. The RA, on the other hand, had been in the story the whole time, and even if its sentience is in question, I can&#39;t recall seeing any <i>Harry Potter</i> spell pass through a solid object to affect its target. Also, while it does save Decima, it does not save the day. In fact, it creates another problem the agents have to solve. So, while any plot device loses its punch if it&#39;s overused, and I regret that the sequence had to be viewed in that context, it doesn&#39;t make this one a god-on-a-machine.<br><br>Ironically, the entire point of killing the RA was to respond to a <i>different</i> trend, of killing anything <i>but</i> the RA, as though it&#39;s sacrosanct. The Ironic Overpower even gets us out here. {= P<br><br>Anyway, thanks again for posting up your comments. It&#39;s always a pleasure to disagree with a real critic. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay, this is a general reply to the crowdsourcing of betawork that has been popping up lately, as well as a recent general lack of actual beta reading that has been going on.<br><br>The idea of &#39;crowdsourcing&#39; out the beta work just does not work, for several reasons. <br><br>For one, you- the people who are doing this- are still releasing something that <i>is not finished</i>. This isn&#39;t getting it beta read. This is just publishing it. <br><br>A beta reader is, quite frankly, an editor. The reason they&#39;re called &#39;beta readers&#39; is because they&#39;re supposed to be the second set of eyes to read it, and correct stuff that the first set did not. Your eyes are the first set. <br><br>A work that isn&#39;t beta read is, very usually, not finished at all. There are always spots that can be fixed, things that can be improved. Even the best writers need an editor. <br><br>I&#39;m betaing on two different items right now. One of them is a PPC work, the other is not. The first was very excellent as it was, but still needed work to become better because it still had flaws. The second has promising writing, but it has a huge amount of flaws. The first, if it was released as-is, would still have been a good mission.  The second, if it was released as-is, would&#39;ve been utter rubbish.<br><br>The point of a beta- one who is properly doing the work- is to make sure everything is written well, and that things that can be improved are improved. Everyone&#39;s work can and should be read by a beta reader. No, there is no such thing as &#39;but it&#39;s good enough on its own&#39;, or &#39;but that just isn&#39;t how <i>I</i> work.&#39;. Beta reading is to improve <i>everything</i>.  It is <i>not</i> not just a casual la-di-da for SPaG. It can be, but it shouldn&#39;t.<br><br>The second issue is that, as I noted previously before, there is nothing to distinguish this as being a &#39;beta&#39; release, and then there being a full and proper release some time later. People are just publishing it right now, full of errors, and asking the audience to fix those for them. That is not beta work. The role of the reader is to read- when you&#39;re reading for enjoyment you aren&#39;t keeping a sharp eye out for things to fix, and when you&#39;re reading for editing it&#39;s less enjoyable because you&#39;re nitpicking everything. The two roles cannot be easily combined. It&#39;s not the reader&#39;s role to have to find the mistakes that were made in the story and fix them for you. It is the rough comparison of having someone over for dinner- and having purchased the food, asking them to cook it into a meal. <br><br>A third reason, beyond those main two, is that it does- I promise you this- change the reader&#39;s perception of you when you do this. We don&#39;t think well of other writers who release things unbeta&#39;d and full of errors, so why would it be different for someone who is in the PPC? In theory we pride ourselves on good writing and its related worksmanship. We make <i>fun</i> of bad writing, yes, but this means we should be <i>serious</i> about ensuring that our own is up to snuff. By up to snuff I mean &quot;can&#39;t randomly poke at the screen multiple times with one work and each time find an error that should have been caught before it was released&quot;.<br><br>Additionally, if you add the names of the people who partially helped with corrections as betareaders, but there are still errors in the story, the perception of those people will also be changed. We end up thinking to ourselves &#39;Gosh, X didn&#39;t get all those mistakes in that last story they beta read for Y. They must be a terrible beta. I don&#39;t want them near my writing! They wouldn&#39;t help me fix it!&#39;, and even more so if you credit them as betas without making the corrections they suggested. This does happen. Even more, people talk to each other. People do, regardless of what we would like to think, develop reputations as they relate to their writing and editing skills. There is a <i>reason</i> why Neshomeh is usually so busy. There is a reason why I get busy <s>(if only for  short bursts of time, as people flock to get their things beta&#39;d, and then run in the other direction, fleeing from nitpicking and fire.)</s>.<br><br>The thing is, in the end, this is the PPC. We should be getting our things beta read before they&#39;re released. We are, after all, against <i>bad</i> writing and being a bad <i>writer</i>. Get your stuff edited. Listen to and learn from concrit. Don&#39;t foist your mistakes onto the readers. Sending it out without beta reading doesn&#39;t say much for you as to your skill or your regard for the readers. Remember, the PPC is supposed to be a <i>community with an emphasis on good writing</i>. Not getting it beta&#39;d and sending it out as-is doesn&#39;t speak much for your opinion on good writing or your interest in the PPC as a community.</p>

            <p>Although I understand what you&#39;re saying, my e-mail (I hope), is not widely available to anyone who wanders into the PPC; this is probably true of a lot of people who are, nonetheless, quite willing to beta read writing samples, or missions, or agents, or indeed anything of the sort. So the only way to reach a beta not on the list is to ask-- on the IRC, or on the &#39;Board.<br><br>I&#39;m notoriously bad at remembering to go through a piece that&#39;s slowly sinking down the page of my inbox, but pretty good, I think, at going over a piece, sentence by sentence by passage, through PM on the IRC. So sometimes, the only way I would beta for someone is if they come into the IRC and go &quot;Hey, I think I&#39;m about done with this. Can anyone beta it for me?&quot;<br><br>I totally agree with you, though, about the other bit. &quot;Hey everyone, here&#39;s stuff, tell me <s>if</s> it&#39;s good&quot; is not beta-ing, nor asking for a beta. But I think you can, with some merit, argue that asking for betas in the IRC is not a bad idea, or even having a chat with a few people conversing on the subject. The list of regulars has gotten to the point, now, where there&#39;s almost always at least eight people on whenever I sign on-- so obviously, doing this in the main #PPC is about as bad an idea as doing it on the &#39;Board. But maybe in #PPC2, where there&#39;s maybe a standing crowd of four or five, or even a temporary room set up for the project, this could work.<br><br>I guess the main point I&#39;m making here is that asking for betas in a crowd, or linking to a not-beta&#39;d work in a chatroom, exists as an issue more on a spectrum of good-bad than as a single yes-or-no answer.</p>

            <p>Perhaps a basic list of betaing tips and such should be posted on the wiki? Since after reading these posts, I have come to realise that I have done these things. I did not know this before and feel bad for the people that read over my story, if I did manage tarnish their image. <br><br>The problem is, this isn&#39;t always commonly known information. I didn&#39;t know and I can bet a number of other new people didn&#39;t either.</p>

            <p>That assumption is obviously misinformed because as you said, there is a problem with it at the moment. And while the general idea of what a beta is might be know, some of the finer details aren&#39;t readily available. </p>

            <p>You&#39;re in a community dedicated to improving your own personal writing while making fun of bad writing. There are certain assumptions that should be true of people who are actively engaged in badfic mockery. One of them is that these people know the proper steps for critiquing a written work — because that is the heart of what the PPC does.<br><br>Being a beta is, in some ways, the first step on the way to doing what PPCers do. Before you can make a satirical critique of a badfic, you must first be able to do a serious, in-depth critique of the strengths and weaknesses of a given story. In essence, you must know how to beta before you can know how to PPC.<br><br>The definition of the beta is simple and straightforward. Any attempt to go into finer details risks leaving parts of the critique out, or having the beta focus too much on the minutiae and not enough on the story as a whole.<br><br>Also, the fact that there are problems with the way people are betaing now doesn’t mean that the current definition is inadequate. It could mean that some of the people (especially the newer ones) have not read the full definition, or some of the oldbies have drifted away from it as time goes on.<br><br>At any rate, hopefully the beta workshop will sort things out.<br><br>~Araeph<br></p>

            <p>I’m glad that this beta workshop is in the works. That would be very useful to all of us who came into the PPC from a different background than one that includes betas, but just not being familiar with what is expected here doesn’t mean that we’ve never critiqued a piece, or closely examined writing before.<br><br>I know I didn&#39;t come from the typical background for a PPCer, especially compared to the oldbies. I came from a writing group dedicated to helping people get published. I read a lot of fanfiction, and I mostly still spend a lot of time reading fanfiction, but I have never written a fanfiction piece.<br><br>When I joined I asked questions about how the beta process worked. I was told that I should have read the wiki if I had questions (I had already read it). Since then I have stumbled through learning as I go, and I know that I have made mistakes along the way.<br><br>In the group I came from there was no beta system. There was a system of critiquing, and I know that you&#39;ve used the two terms interchangeably here, but the system that they used (and every other original fiction writer’s group I’ve ever visited) was vastly different from the system described on the wiki and that has been outlined in this thread.<br><br>It&#39;s in things like how does one approach a beta? What is the best way to turn someone down if you don&#39;t think you can handle a piece? What do you do if someone has agreed to beta for you and then not answered the questions you needed answered? How long should you wait with not having heard from your beta before you ask them about it?<br><br>There is so much interaction involved in the beta process. With the critique process from the other group I was in, there was a forum for posting a crit request, someone answered, the piece was sent over, read over, and an extensive report* was sent back. There might be some back and forth messaging, but it was pretty hands off in the interpersonal interaction and extended conversation departments.<br><br><br>*Recommended critique report format from my former group<br> 1.  My first impressions of your story:<br> 2.  The plot:<br> 3.  The characters:<br> 4.  The action:<br> 5.  The dialogue:<br> 6.  The background:<br> 7.  The overall story:<br> 8.  The theme:<br> 9.  The technical details (spelling, grammar, scientific or historical details), etc.:<br> 10.  What I loved about this work, and why:<br> 11.  What caused me problems, and why:<br> 12.  Final comments:<br> 13.  A link to the story of mine I would like comments on: (if applicable)<br><br></p>

            <p>Less personal than most of us like to be, I think, but I believe the points in the recommended format there correspond pretty well to what&#39;s in the wiki&#39;s description of what a beta looks at. It&#39;s more specific than what we&#39;ve got, but still. The only difference I can think of is that a critique as such happens after a piece is considered finished, and a beta happens before, with the express intent that changes will happen between beta-reading and publishing.<br><br>... Actually, that format looks <i>incredibly</i> useful for keeping on track during any sort of critique, pre- or post-publication. Mind if I snurch that?<br><br>Regarding background, yours is a lot closer to those of us of the fanfic-writing bent than other folks, some of whom have turned up with no previous writing or fanfic experience at all, as I recall. I think that&#39;s what baffles some of us oldbies so much. We&#39;ve never expressly had a prerequisite of writing/fanfic experience to be a PPCer, but that&#39;s because pretty much everyone had it anyway, so it didn&#39;t need to be said. Granted, we need to get our heads around the idea that things are different, and the &quot;typical background&quot; isn&#39;t so typical anymore, but at the same time, I think it&#39;s fair for us to expect that people joining a new community get familiar with the territory without having to be instructed.<br><br>Regarding the questions you posed, I think they&#39;re good ones, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re specific to beta-reading. You&#39;d have to deal with those in any kind of collaboration with another person. In general, I would simply answer &quot;be respectful and honest,&quot; but the finer details do need to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis; what counts as respect for one person may not work for someone else, etc.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

To add my own two cents as a beta (albeit one with the worst habit of procrastination, if not getting sick/hit with real life/married on the job), if you agree to beta-read something, you agree to share equally in the responsibility for the finished product. If people are still pointing out errors and things that don&#39;t work after you&#39;re done with it, you did not do your job well enough, and neither did the author. This is a bad thing. You should both learn from it and do better in the future.<br><br>If there are <i>multiple</i> betas and this still happens, I don&#39;t even know what to say.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

The other three betas disagreed. That fourth beta is therefore not credited; not because I was angry he disagreed, but because I did not want to stick his name on something he thought should be done differently. That&#39;s just rude, folks, and I fully and heartily agree with July on that point. That&#39;s also one of the only times I have gone against something a beta has said (and off the top of my head, that&#39;s the only time I can think of.)<br><br>So yeah.

            <p>They told me about the humor thing before they had fully beta&#39;d it, and pretty much told me they did not like it and I should change it. When I conferred with the others and determined that this person was in the minority, he shrugged and pretty much said &#39;do what you want, but you&#39;re wrong and I don&#39;t like this story.&#39; And that was it as far as his &#39;beta read&#39; went.

            <p>The idea of &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; betawork really, really puts me off. I wouldn&#39;t want to risk my writing even being seen by the general public, not until a beta-reader had told me that they had no more issues with what I wrote. It&#39;s a personal ethic I&#39;ve picked up (read: had hammered into me by several tough but very kind betas) since I joined the PPC, and as July said, we should be doing the best we can for our own writing if we&#39;re going to comment on other people&#39;s.<br><br>I&#39;ve also experienced bad things on the other end of the beta-reading relationship. I had one person ask me to beta a piece - which I did, as thoroughly as I possibly could, making all my comments and adjustments in bright red - and then they posted the original, unbetaed piece and credited me as the beta-reader. I was horrified and never offered to beta for them again. Not paying attention to a beta-reader is a massive, massive disrespect when they&#39;ve put so much effort into trying to help you.<br><br>There are people in the PPC who <i>love</i> to be the second pair of eyes, and will happily take on the job if asked - or even volunteer for it.*<br><br>Please, don&#39;t continue this trend of asking the people who want to read your story if they&#39;ll please check it for errors while they&#39;re at it. That&#39;s not why they want to read it. Not to mention, you&#39;re likely to get contrasting ideas of what an error is, based on things even as simple as alternate spellings. (America vs. England, Round Fiftybajillon! DING! XD )<br><br>Finally, I can&#39;t resist putting a basic guide to getting betaed here, in the hope it helps and/or entertains. :P<br><br><b>Step 1:</b> Get a beta-reader. There are plenty of them around the PPC, as has been said. They don&#39;t bite. :D <br><b>Step 2:</b> Ask them to give your work a proper look-through. If you can, make time to sit down and chat with them as they work, so you can answer any queries they have as they go. It can sometimes give you new ideas, too!<br><b>Step 2b:</b> If you can&#39;t sit down and chat for any length of time, ask them to mark every change and query they find, so you know exactly where the problems are, and then get them to send it back to you.<br><b>Step 3:</b> Look over the betaed piece thoroughly and alter things as your beta-reader suggests; fix your SPaG, respond to queries, polish things up a little more.<br><b>Step 4:</b> DO NOT ASSUME YOU ARE NOW GOOD TO GO. Take the redone piece back to the beta-reader and ask them to check it again. You may have made other mistakes in the fixing of the originals, or there could be something your beta-reader missed first time round.<br><b>Step 5:</b> If your beta-reader <b>is not</b> satisfied with your work, return to step 2a or 2b as appropriate and repeat. if your beta-reader <b>is</b> satisfied with your work, go to step 6.<br><b>Step 6:</b> Publish!<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br><br>*I am one of those people.

            <p>I&#39;ll use the term &quot;mission&quot; to indicate the text, but I think the same rebuttal works for any text.<br><br>I tend to consider a mission &quot;released&quot; only when posted on an &quot;open&quot; site. One you could access with any sufficiently specific Google search, or just by finding a random link anywhere.<br><br>GoogleDocs isn&#39;t, as the only way to access the document is to click on the link to the mission in beta status. Provided only in the beta read request.<br><br>And I want to underline that, <i>beta read request</i>. The ones opening the link are supposedly only Boarders who want to actually beta the mission, or maybe just have a look on how you are writing for just a couple of quick advices. Alias mostly the same people who already did beta reading the old way, and they just got the link on the Board instead of in a mail. (And they find the mission exactly in the same state either way).<br><br>True, nobody stops you from just reading it, but you are reading something not completed <i>and you know it.</i><br><br>Sure, I agree with you about the fact that few beta readers actually answer to those requests. In fact, from my next mission I&#39;ll start asking Beta Reader List people directly again via e-mail.<br><br>But I&#39;ll also keep posting the beta request on the board with link to the Googledocs document.<br><br>We are the PPC. We are mature enough to not click on a link with &quot;BETA REQUEST&quot; over it if we don&#39;t want to be beta readers. And we are also supposed to be able to recognize when our beta-readers finished working or not.<br><br>I usually let at least a week after the last beta reader edit/comment before considering the beta closed, unless all of them gave a &quot;whole mission opinion&quot; and there are no major issues that require rewriting of parts of the mission. (In fact, by the time I actually posted my interlude, the beta request was already off the first page)<br><br>I am not giving an excuse to the ones who, like Vixenmage said, basically rush through beta status without letting their beta readers actually <i>beta</i> on it, or actually put the mission in beta status right after finishing the first draft (the horror... the horror...), as JulyFlame implied. That&#39;s absolutely wrong and unspeakably immature.<br><br><br>Er... To the ones who didn&#39;t understand yet what I am saying, as I might be a bit confusing: crowdsourcing can work, but only if who calls for it doesn&#39;t use it to rush through release like some Suethors do. As I do it, it&#39;s only supposed to lessen e-mail exchange and thus save up a little bit of time.<br>Since some of us have little free time, it gives them more time to actually work on the betaing.<br>Of course, crowdsourcing alone isn&#39;t enough, as I noticed after using it two times.<br><br></p>

            <p>I would point out that your definition of &quot;released&quot; doesn&#39;t account for all the missions that are only published as GoogleDocs.  There is a growing collection of them, due to people lacking the resources, time, or skills needed to create their own archives.<br><br>I am also going to point out that, while we should be willing to put the work into betareading someone&#39;s work if we open the link, the overwhelming majority of comments that I see on most of these threads amount to &quot;It&#39;s good.  Good job.&quot;  We have a serious problem, right now, in this community with people not taking the time to give any sort of constructive criticism when they read a mission, as a beta or as a normal reader.<br><br>Your rebuttal is idealistic, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that.  We should be mature enough.  We should let our beta readers do their job.  We absolutely should put real effort into the editing process.  But there comes a time when you can&#39;t ignore how something is just because you see how it should be.<br><br>Some of us aren&#39;t mature enough.  Some of us don&#39;t let our betas do their jobs.  Some of us don&#39;t put any real effort into the editing process.<br><br>I don&#39;t mean any of this to sound harsh.

            <p>In fact, I am betaing firemagic&#39;s first mission and, aside from me and Pieguy, I didn&#39;t see other beta-readers on it.

            <p>Serious does not necessarily mean the opposite of humor.  Great comedians will tell you that they take their craft very seriously.  In this case, serious means &quot;requiring thought, concentration, or application,&quot; which is the fourth definition on dictionary.com.  I would also accept definition three &quot;being in earnest, sincere, not trifling.&quot;  A serious problem is one that is no little thing, and/or that requires thought.<br><br>I take my writing, humorous or not, very seriously.  I expect that, in a community based on good writing, people would take their reviews and beta work seriously, as well.  I want to see more thought put into a review than &quot;...Owch, talk about your bad fics. At least your agents took care of this one. (Seriously, how do all those different series go together?!)&quot; That is the entirety of an actual review and it has nothing to do with the content of the mission.  You don&#39;t even need to read a mission to post a review like this.  The sad part?  That kind of review is the norm.  This is the kind of thing we expect from badfic reviewers.<br><br>If that is the standard we are slipping to, and the evidence <i>is</i> piling up that it is, then I would say we have a serious problem.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>There is a big difference between putting something up on the Board to ask for some outside opinions, and putting it on the wiki/publishing it on an open site.

            <p>While there is nothing wrong with saying &quot;I am looking for a betareader for a mission in X fandom&quot; and then working with the interested party to edit the work, there is a problem with saying &quot;here is my mission, feel free to beta it.&quot;<br><br>Part of what the beta process does is it helps you to learn how to work with an editor.

            <p>I don&#39;t have time to respond to all of this and nitpick and whine and all that, but I do have one thing to agree with, heartily.<br><br><i>Additionally, if you add the names of the people who partially helped with corrections as betareaders, but there are still errors in the story, the perception of those people will also be changed.</i><br><br>THIS. So, <i>so</i> much this. If you ask me to beta or glance over your work, for SpaG or canon or whatever, and we get through one page or two, and decide to call it a night, <i>I did not beta your story</i>. I cannot <s>politely</s> express how much that irks me. Because here&#39;s the thing-- if I went over your story for four hours, or full days, and we discussed the issues, the characterization, the style, the formatting, over the entire thing... that is <i>not</i> equivalent to going over the comma errors on the first two pages, and deciding to call it a night and go back to the work later.<br><br>And people, on just about every writing forum I&#39;ve been a part of, have done this to me multiple times-- we talk on GTalk, or the IRC, or AIM, or whatever, and after a cursory reading, I say &quot;Okay, that&#39;s all I can do for tonight, let&#39;s go over this more later,&quot; and then the next morning I see my name credited on the &#39;Board as beta, and it drives me crazy, because I <i>know</i> there were issues with the story we didn&#39;t get around to fixing.<br><br>The rest of what July is saying, I&#39;ll have to look over more when I&#39;ve got more time. I just wanted to say that the issue she has, there, is a very, very valid one. Please don&#39;t credit someone as a beta if they haven&#39;t told you, specifically, &quot;Yes, this is a finished work, no more issues I can see.&quot;</p>

            <p>Euripides&#39; plays <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i> and <i>The Phoenician Women</i> have a number of interpolations by later playwrights, as does Shakespeare&#39;s <i>MacBeth</i> (and the character of Hecate adds absolutely nothing to the story). Furthermore, Euripides&#39; <i>The Bacchantes</i> has a lacuna of fifty lines or so near the end; there was evidently damage to the volume it was in. The translation I read had verse to spackle this. How does the PPC regard such additional or replacement text? Canon? Semi-canon?</p>

            <p>Canon damage is when a canon is viewed differently by the audience from its original release. Some examples are Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin, which was actually re-scripted by different people because they didn&#39;t like the message, or the Sonic Universe games, that have had their image irreversibly changed by saturation of badfic and bad art.<br><br>These works have been changed and patched since their release to the point where some meaning has been added, changed, or lost. These particular damages seem to have healed, and the canon has become stable. Nobody disputes them.<br><br>I would even venture so far as to say even a bad translation or adaptation would damage a canon, and if the canon can&#39;t heal... its meaning to the audience changes. A good example would be Final Fantasy 4. It had a horrible translation, and if it hadn&#39;t been re-translated later then it would have been stuck that way. However, some items of the bad translation stuck, healed-over into in-jokes...</p>

            <p>Is it bad that these things hardly faze me anymore? I mean, what goes on in the fic certainly does, but the fact that people write this stuff has become pretty commonplace in this fandom. I mean, between Cupcakes and its fan-made spinoffs and sequels, The Rainbow Factory, and the Creepy Ponies artwork series on Deviantart, it&#39;s disturbingly common for fics to have horrible things happen to the ponies.<br><br>There&#39;s actually a separate genre for it on Equestria Daily.

            <p>Hello. It&#39;s me again. (For those of you who don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m the lurker/babbler that always has silly questions no matter how long she hangs around the Board).<br><br>I&#39;d like to try writing a mission or two, and I just want to know whether you think I can. <br><br>A) You don’t have agents up here, so what do you want?<br><br>You to tell me that if I do come up with a couple, they’ll be considered on their own merits and not for a lack of credentials that has nothing to do with them. (I.e. is it worth my time to do a write up?)<br><br>B) You haven&#39;t been around very much.<br><br>…Not recently, no, but I’ve done my best to catch up. In past times, I’ve been around quite a lot. I’ve heard plenty of discussions about what’s sporkable and what’s not, what’s a flame is and what’s not, what’s charge-worthy and what’s not, etc. I am not going to make first-month beginner mistakes.<br><br>C) Why are you doing this?/Why now?<br><br>In 2011, I did NaNoWriMo in 17 days. It was terrifying. Recently, I put up my first fanfics, and that opened up a whole slew of interesting issues. There was one that I wrote and (thankfully) did not publish, which, once I squinted at it, could actually have been sporkable. It was indeed a Mary-Sue. I’ve come to the conclusion that the good stuff goes online and the fun but really bad stuff just stays offline. However... it still worries me. It may seem redundant to say this, since I’m on the PPC Board, of all places, but I want to be a better writer.<br><br>I suppose the simple answer is “for educational purposes”. I can’t actually say, “for love of fandom”, because that would be a lie; I am specifically going to NOT choose a horrible fic from my absolute favorite fandoms because that would be too painful to read, and it would put me in a bad mood. I already have plenty of things in my life that put me in a bad mood. I do not wish PPC work to be one of them. <br><br>D) What do I not know about you that I probably should?<br><br>Oh, you mean “why might I be a liability”? Right. I’ve said dumb things in the past and I will say dumb things in the future. I’ve disagreed with some of you in the past, and will do so in the future as well. Due to an experience with a very good writer who I admired that told me my writing was “appalling”, I sometimes disagree with some of the harsher statements the PPC makes… and then I turn around and read something so horrible I find the “stay civil” rules constraining. I enjoy parodies, which means there will probably be a small flavor of self-parody in the mission, so yes, I may point out things about the PPC which I do not like which you do.<br><br>Also, I have no beta.<br><br>E) …so why should I let you do this, again?<br>I’m pretty sure I know what I’m doing. I’m open to criticism and correction (the whole point of this exercise is so I can become a better writer). <br>Hopefully, I’ll also amuse you and/or stretch your brain.

So… probably taking care of a Sue in from Narnia. Also, I’m willing to deal with Twilight crossovers, which appears to be abnormally painful for most people. (Or normally painful. Maybe it’s abnormally un-painful for me, then?) Or NCIS: LA, or Blue Bloods (TV), or Eragon, or Artemis Fowl, or Percy Jackson, or whatever you like that I know about. There are a few others—Lord of the Rings, Discworld—that I’d be willing to spork, but there are so many “experts” on those here I’d rather leave it to them (especially LotR).<br><br>G) What will you do if I say no?<br><br>Wait. It’s what I did the first time I was told my PPC agents were flat (an assessment I now find accurate) and I’ve been doing it for quite a while, so … *shrug* <br><br>H) What’s with this giant FAQ? <br><br>I’ve learned from experience that most PPC writers appreciate logical, laid-out arguments. Also, I figured since I was probably going to get all these questions anyway, I might as well write it all up now.<br></p>

            <p>It isn&#39;t your agents that need permission—it&#39;s you, the writer. I point this out because I&#39;ve seen evidence of confusion about this more than once, from various people.

            <p>I apologise for the poor quality right off the bat (never had a lesson asside from some high school art one semester) but It&#39;s my first real art &quot;project&quot; since before high school, when I used to lose myself in big, complicated scenes drawn in notebooks.<br><br><a href="http://kifkeykrunchies.deviantart.com/#/d4n7uro"><a href="http://kifkeykrunchies.deviantart.com/#/d4n7uro">http://kifkeykrunchies.deviantart.com/#/d4n7uro</a></a><br><br>(I must say in advance: This is my own interpretation of the Mythos that acknowledges that Lovecraft had quite a few issues while treating Cosmic Horror as a fact rather than the goal).<br><br>It basically fits into one of the characters in yet another fic project I&#39;m working on, this one the Lovecraftian Yog-Sothothery.  My view is that most of the cults are driven by greed or nuttiness. The Cthulhu cult is especially loony, only used by it&#39;s sacred Deep-One leaders to act as a presence on the surface (The Big C is essentially a Cultural hero to the fishies, the leader of the Starspawn who &quot;freed&quot; them from enslavement under the Elder Things and who Dagon and Hydra, swore themselves to serve).  <br><br>However, some groups ... well, essentially they keep their humanity while still worshiping the Outer Gods, or the primal forces of the universe.  One example was a peculiar religious order among the southern Iroquois, who used captive warriors  from the so-called &quot;mourning wars&quot; and the Beaver Wars as sacrifices to the Orendas of fertility and health (aka, Shub Niggurath).  <br><br>Some of these practices were adopted by isolated communities of English Quakers in the early 1700&#39;s when harsh winters presented no other choice.  While they banned Human sacrifice, the instituted sacrifice of livestock (pigs and chickens instead of dogs) and, by the 1920s, it was hard to distinguish the descendants of this group from very light-skinned, mostly assimilated Iroquois.  Isolation had left them thin-faced and bony from the beginnings of systematic inbreeding while matrilineal descent and inheritance patterns only gave way as the Feds began snooping... or Miskatonic professors, one of which stole these items from a church reliquary.<br><br>The modern group has eased up on the inbreeding... but the fear of them being massacred by the authorities (egged on by academics screaming &quot;degenerate!&quot;) has always held its quiet place among the community, regardless of official religious freedom.  The whole Innsmouth thing didn&#39;t help much.  <br><br>Getting massacred by more violent Shub-Niggurath cults or getting the Altar treatment from those self same cultists is the much bigger worry, it seems.<br></p>

            <p>So, um, these are my agents thus far. COuld I have some criticism, please? They will be working in the Department of Bad Parody, Troll Division.<br><br>Holly Lewis- An extracted embryo from a Narnian bad slash fic, Holly grew up in the Nursery, and is recently out of training, having worked for a short period in the DMS. She’s unusually prissy, very logical, and organised. Holly also has a touch of obsessive cleaning disorder, and hates any kind of dirt in the RC. She has coffee-coloured skin and frizzy brown hair that is always tangled, despite her many attempts to tame it. Holly has a phobia of heights.<br><br>Duke- Formerly Bubbles, a Potterverse Sue’s Cute Animal Friend, Duke is a talking golden retriever. In contrast to Holly, Duke is incredibly laid back about missions, sometimes skipping charges in the charge list, and even forgetting to read it at all. This has gotten him into very serious trouble with the Flowers, and resulted in his partnership with Holly, who refuses to leave the continuum unless the charge list has been read.<br><br>Aisling* O’Dwyer- A World One recruit who stumbled across the New Caledonia entrance whist on holiday there, and opted to join. Aisling is one of those infuriating people who can eat as much as they want and never put on weight. However, she isn’t very physically fit. Hence, she prefers to pick off her enemies from a distance. Aisling is very much in her own little world. Sometimes she’ll break off in the middle of a sentence to think about something entirely unrelated, and sometimes she’ll say things that make little sense to anyone else. She’s generally very calm, but Aisling does have a serious temper on her, it just takes a lot for her to lose it.<br><br>*Sorry for the slight Cat-on-keyboardness. It&#39;s pronounced ash-ling, and it&#39;s actually a reasonably popular Irish name.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d advise you to be careful with a World One recruit&#39;s background: they just can&#39;t simply vanish off the surface of planet Earth just like that. They&#39;re bound to have friends and family that are going to notice their absence. Perhaps it could be a plot point for an interlude or something of the genre.</p>

            <p>The talking golden retriever agent sounds familiar, though. Lemme see... *searches wiki* Yup, there it is: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Nytbloomer">Agent Nytbloomer and guide dog Judy</a>. Not that &quot;it&#39;s been done&quot; really means anything; just something to be aware of.<br><br>Of course, the usual criticism I have is not actually a criticism, but a question: Why? A character is more than a collection of traits, so why these traits? Where do they come from? What effect on the character&#39;s life do they have? How will they aid you in telling a story? What is their purpose? If they don&#39;t come into play at all, they might as well not exist, so it&#39;s always good to think about these things.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Missions:<br><br>Since I&#39;m pretty much resurrecting the Troll Divison, and <br>have very little material to work with, I was thinking it would operate like this:<br><br>Holly would deal with killing &#39;Sues/Character Replacements and neuralyzing canons, while Aisling would cover such things as excorcising &#39;Sue Wraiths, pulling character out of plotholes and in the case of Character Replacements, finding the canons.<br><br>Meanwhile, Duke would use his superior sense of smell to track down the actual troll (which are invisible, according to my source) and contact the others as soon as he found it via walkie talkies.<br><br>Then, Holly and Aisling would join Duke to charge and take down the troll.<br><br>Reasons for joining:<br><br>Holly was pretty much raised to hate &#39;Sues, and has wanted to be an agent her entire life, so it&#39;s unsurprising that she joined.<br><br>Duke was seriously neglected by the &#39;Sue in his fic, it got to the point where he hated her beyond all reason and was quite glad to see her killed. When he found out abot the PPC, this spread to all &#39;Sues, and he was all too happy to join up.<br><br>According to the Wiki, the New Caledonia door to HQ is in the mountains. I imagine that Aisling was on a mountaineering holiday, got bored and wandered off, then stumbled across the door and decided to see what was inside. As for her reason for joining, Aisling is incredibly obsessive about the canons she likes, and can&#39;t stand badfic. She was an enthusiastic reviewer of fanfiction and merely saw the PPC as the next step. Also, when Aisling first joined, I think she might have thought she was dreaming.</p>

            <p>4) In the Original Series, the disguises that they used were actual shape-shifting ones meant to blend them in with the canon. Not being able to do magic in that form would stick out, perhaps. Also, it&#39;s unknown if they&#39;d ever taken courses in controlling a disguise like that. This kind of disguise is from the Disguise Generator in the console. The D.O.R.K.S. disguises are more holograms than actual body-morph substitute identities.<br><br>5) You can do this any way you want, really. It really depends on the context. If it&#39;s a character telling us the story of what happened, it might just be that a character is standing there relating a big long winded tale. If it&#39;s the narrative then what&#39;s happened is that something that happened sequentially &#39;before&#39; has been put &#39;after...&#39; and maybe it COULD be a time portal to the past. But maybe the narrative progresses word-per-word and the &#39;flashback&#39; doesn&#39;t include anything more than what it mentions. Or maybe not. It&#39;s your call on the context and how to handle it.<br><br>Time is wibbly-wobbly, after all.</p>

            <p>I once had a flashback manifest by the characters freezing into place and a grainy black and white image of the flashback content be super-imposed over them.

<li>The tradition is unfortunately, no. If it isn&#39;t covered in the mission, it doesn&#39;t happen. This is why you&#39;ll sometimes see PPCers detailing things in author&#39;s notes that they weren&#39;t able to include in missions.<br><br><br><br>2. Most clean-up is usually done after a Sue is taken down by the agents. If a character is said to be next to the Sue right up until the moment of the agents stopping the story, then  they can&#39;t neuralyze that character before then. The Suefluence needs to be gone from a character for it to work properly. If a character disappears from a story, then that is a bit different. <br><br>I&#39;ve rescued or neuralyzed canons that no longer appear in a story well before the end of a mission. In the Victorian Zombie Apocalypse story, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and Mary Watson all appeared in the story, then were plotholed out of the story. The agents rescued them and sent them to Medical (Lestrade and Mary both badly needed Medical&#39;s help in their last appearance). In other cases, where things aren&#39;t so apocalyptic I&#39;ve pulled canons aside, neuralyzed them and sent them on their way after their last appearance in the fic, under the idea that they have been removed from the Suefluence by the story itself.<br><br>There is also the possibility of saving a canon or OC that you are recruiting from an off-screen death (or on-screen if you use a Simulation Generator), and then having that character stay with you for the rest of the mission.<br><br><br><br>3. I&#39;d say yes, RAs can open a plothole to wherever we want them to, but if the agents don&#39;t have permission to go witness Lily and James&#39; murder and the fic doesn&#39;t deal with it, then the agents should have a good reason for doing it or be willing to face reprimand from a Flower.</li>

Well, it&#39;s not played out any more, so I&#39;d say no.<br><br>2) If the neuralyzed characters don&#39;t have any more appearances... in my current mission, the agents drag along a misplaced canon they pulled out of a plot hole. So, really, it&#39;s up to you, I&#39;d say.<br><br>3) I don&#39;t see why not. It&#39;s the same &#39;verse.</p>

It&#39;s exactly what it says it is: an origin story for Orken. Unfortunately, the badfic he was recruited from (something I wrote by hand when I was twelve) has been lost to the depths of time. The one &quot;badfic quote&quot; comes from a spelling mistake I used to make a lot, and the bits of the plot I mention are true to what I remember. Also, the thing about the dracon beams is not narrative convenience to explain how Orken acquired stuff in Headquarters; I really did have an obsession with the damn things when I wrote the badfic in question. <br><br>Also, this is possibly, the introduction of a new agent pair, because I really like the way that they play off of each other. Hannibal, of course, has gotten mentions in previous stuff I&#39;ve written, but Kay is new. </p>

            <p>I very muchly like Hannibal!  His dialogue is tons of fun to read aloud, and he can be both joking and serious.  I wouldn&#39;t mind reading some &quot;flashback&quot; missions of him and Kay.  They kept the tone of this piece fairly upbeat, and I didn&#39;t find it very dark at all.<br><br>Irmish?  <i>Irmish</i>?  What an awful-sounding name, even for a Yeerk.  (No offense.)<br><br>Some mistakes I caught!<br>&quot;The voice was familiar. He had heard it before, not <b>to</b> long ago.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He thought about what <b>Hannival</b> had said harder about things than he had been previously.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hannibal watched the <b>wheel’s</b> turn in Orken’s head. When the look of confusion was slowly replaced by a growing anger, the agent <b>know</b> that Orken had had his epiphany.&quot;</p>

            <p>To be completely honest, I don&#39;t remember what the original Yeerk!Stus name was; I actually think it may have started with an O. (Not Orken, if you were wondering. That I know for sure.) However, I&#39;m pretty sure there was an &quot;m&quot; in it somewhere, and yeah, I think it was horrible. Maybe. What&#39;s always stuck with me was not the name, but the plan. Dear god, why did I think that was a good plan? Granted, it actually has amusing similarities to the Fenian invasion of Canada, but that was also a terrible plan. That, and the sidekick accountant who stole millions of dollars with dummy corporations and fake stock; a la Edriss in Visser.<br><br>Thanks for catching those mistakes; they have been fixed. </p>

            <p>...was about the extent of the plan. Well, that, and some unhosted yeerks in a portable pool that had somehow been overlooked. (Irmish was one of them.) Yeah, it was a terrible plan.<br><br>Kay? Well, she comes from the Inheritence verse. You know, that series we&#39;re always making fun of for being extra purple, having a Gary Stu protagonist, and ripping off star wars. She&#39;s a magic user, using the rules of that verse. She&#39;s above average in strength (the fact she can cast spells without speaking implies that); she absolutely loves television, and she really likes loot. She also isn&#39;t that bloodthirsty; more impatient, which plays off of Hannibal&#39;s more collected, professional and generally more organized approach to things. <br><br>Hannibal... well, if you read the interlude, you have a pretty good idea bout who he is. The only relevant detail not in this story which you likely already know if you follow my spinoff at all is that he is now completely bald thanks to Thomas&#39; bringing plutonium back from a mission. This is something that, understandably, really pissed off Orken.(Which is why it&#39;s referenced in at least half of my missions.) Hannibal and Thomas have not spoken since, and Thomas has been actively avoiding him; so exactly how he feels about Thomas is unknown. I do plan on having them meet up eventually, and Orken... well, I&#39;ll talk more about their relationship (which I promise, is not romantic, so don&#39;t get any ideas) in future interludes, maybe.<br><br>Yeah... that&#39;s probably more than you needed or wanted to know about Hannibal, but it helped me to write all that out, so feel free to not read that section. :p</p>

            <p>First off, if we aren&#39;t supposed to do this kind of thing on the board could someone please tell me. I&#39;m a bit new so I&#39;m not entirely sure.<br><br>If you could have dinner with three fictional, canonical characters, who would they be. You don&#39;t have to say why if you can&#39;t think of a reason, &quot;They seem like nice people.&quot; is good enough, and if you can&#39;t limit it to three then feel free to set more places at the table, just don&#39;t get crazy. Be sure to say who they are and what they&#39;re from.<br><br>I would pick Myouren Hijiri, Buddhist Monk/Magician and older brother and teacher of Byakuren Hijiri, who was willing to do anything to live forever. He allowed himself to die when it was his time, rather then fighting off death, or gripping onto life.<br>Originates from Touhou. <br><br>My second would be Kasen Ibaraki, a Hermit who freed herself from biological need and lives completely in tune with the natural world around her, to the point of being acquainted with many creatures that rarely(if ever) show themselves to humans, including a raijuu(rat thing that controls storms) and a dapeng(bird big enough to fly you around. She faked her death in a way that would cross her name from the celestial records, allowing her to live forever. She must still fight off reapers who seek to take her, and youkai, who would gain immense power if they were to eat her.<br>Originates from Touhou as well.<br><br>Lastly I would pick Death, the fourth horseman, as old as God, he was forced into a contract with Lucifer, but immediately fought against it and gave the Winchester Brothers the way to put Lucifer back in the cage. Has been shown to be unnervingly calm in all circumstances, and a connoisseur of food. I would definitely let him pick where/what we ate.<br>Originates from Supernatural.<br><br>All three have a unique perspective on life and death(one who accepted his death when it came for him, one who fights daily to keep her immortality, one who is the embodiment of death itself.) as well as each one being incredibly wise in some way. If it were something I could have, then a friendly discussion with the three of them would be something I would look forward to immensely.<br><br>I also look forward to seeing what everyone else thinks of.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s so...so... so many choices! So many reasons...<br><br>There&#39;s category A: People that are hungry and sad who you think deserve a nice dinner off on the side.<br><br>That would be: all single moms on the face of the planet (it&#39;s difficult), anyone from the hunger games (barring President Snow and the Careers, of course), quite literally millions of people from the past, especially from the Black Death (not that I want it), but ye gods, if anyone needs a nice dinner, it&#39;s them.<br><br>There&#39;s category B: The fascinating, fascinating people that exist...everywhere. Everyone&#39;s fascinating. I find everyone fascinating... if given enough time.<br><br>Um, I guess that would include a lot of psychopaths, though, which brings us to subcategory C: people who are pretty safe.<br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610</a></a><br><br>Now, I&#39;m horrible with conversation, so most people I&#39;d love to meet would simply terrify me. Let&#39;s disregard that. Pretend like I know what I&#39;m doing when I open my mouth (which I never do)<br><br>There&#39;s basically every Terry Pratchett character... Miss Susan and Sam Vimes and Carrot and Angua and Sybil and Miss Susan&#39;s class, the lot of them...<br><br>There&#39;s Aerin from Robin McKinley&#39;s books, and Harimad-sol.<br><br>There&#39;s the whole lot of NCIS, and Jane and Lisbon and Grace and Cho from the Mentalist. All fascinating.<br><br>There&#39;s Jason Bourne, and Marie, both of the movies and books (preferably the books)... Ludlum only, of course.<br><br>There&#39;s Neverwhere&#39;s Marquis de Carabas (though depending on what state he&#39;s in, he may ruin my appetite), and Door and Richard.<br><br>There&#39;s the Three (Four, really) Musketeers...<br><br>There&#39;s everyone... and the only reasons those people are there is because basically they&#39;re the first people I thought of. Others are springing up in my head even as I write, believe me.<br><br>Sigh. <br><br>I suppose there should be an actual top three, huh?<br><br>Okay. <br><br>1) Patrick Jane of (the great god) Bruno Heller&#39;s TV show the Mentalist: fascinating, and not likely to kill me. Unless I was a serial killer, which, thankfully, I&#39;m not.<br><br>2) Miss Susan of (the great god) Pterry&#39;s Discworld series: also fascinating, and more likely to scold me than kill me. Hopefully.<br><br>3) Too difficult. Just too difficult. <br><br>I was kind of itching to put Sam Vimes on there, but making the poor man go to a social function without his wife would be a disaster... not to mention the fact that most of the people there would scare him and he&#39;d want to arrest us all or at least lock us up somewhere secure.</p>

            <p>My guess is, he&#39;d wonder what planet Snorkack and friends came from. He *has* seen weirder things, after all. XD<br>His reaction to her magic would also probably be fun, although I have *no* idea how that one might play out.</p>

            <p>Hmmm... so many to choose from.<br><br><br>1 - Sherlock Holmes from the 2010 BBC Series because he is several different kinds of brilliant, and I&#39;d love to see what he&#39;d make of me and my other two guests. Might make for some... awkward conversations (read: him trying to outsmart everyone else, but meh)<br><br>2 - Twilight Sparkle from MLP: FiM. I&#39;d love to learn more about Equestria and how everything &#39;works&#39; there, and I mean: cool geeky pony that can do magic? What&#39;s not to like?!<br><br>3 - The 10th Doctor from Doctor Who. Do I really have to give a reason? He&#39;s the Doctor! We wouldn&#39;t be short of interesting stories, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br>Hmm... three egotistical (well, 1 and 3 certainly) super-geniuses. This could be interesting.</p>

            <p>Hmmm, this is a hard decision to narrow it so a small set, but, not impossible.<br><br>(Ten minutes Later)<br><br>Well, my final decision would be<br><br>1. Rodney McKay, from Stargate: Atlantis. Reason? Because he is the right mix of funny, sarcastic, and intelligent that would make the dinner conversation VERY interesting.<br><br>2. Luxury, from the PPC. Reason? Because she would be able to diffuse any tense or awkward situations (probably by doing something even more awkward). She is a nice enough person, and I&#39;m sure she would have plenty to talk about, especially with so much food and people around.<br><br>3. Dracula, from Castlevania. Reason? Because the dude is regal while still being a demon/vampire, and would bring some posh into the dinner convo. He would probably think Luxury was Succcubus from his castle, so not too offput by her. And hey, if things get bad with him, we can always count (Stealth Punned!) on a Belmont crashing in to fight him, and some cheesy dialogue from the two.<br><br></p>

            <p>I could turn this into a banquet room so easily .... :)<br><br>But my first three choices would be:<br><br>1) Brother Cadfael.  He&#39;d have a lot of good stories, and from references in the books I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be upset about my not being Catholic.  I&#39;d have to get some of my friends to recommend a wine to go with dinner, though, since he&#39;s from a period when that was normal even for monks.  (From the novels by Ellis Peters.)<br><br>2) Since I&#39;m already getting wine recommendations, the second guest will be Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  He&#39;s another person who should have lots of stories.  (From Star Trek:The Next Generation.)<br><br>3) For my third guest, I&#39;d probably go for Belgarath the Sorcerer.  Talk about having stories, the guy&#39;s been active in the world for seven thousand years -- and he spent a chunk of that time traveling as a professional storyteller, so he can certainly tell them well.  If this is post-Malloreon, I&#39;d set a place for his wife Poledra as well.  I thought about inviting Polgara, but I think she would be too intimidating as a dinner guest; in canon she&#39;s the best cook in the world.  (From the novels by David Eddings.)<br><br>I&#39;d probably keep the menu simple, so we can relax and enjoy the stories.</p>

<li>Professor Kirke from the Chronicles of Narnia. He would have plenty of interesting things to talk about.<br>2. Percy Jackson from Percy Jackson and the Olympians, because he&#39;s funny. Things tend to explode around him, though, so I probably wouldn&#39;t want to put out the nice silverware.<br>3. I have to pick Paul Fester from The Midnight Dancers, by Regina Doman. (That&#39;s a novel-length retelling of the Twelve Dancing Princesses which, sadly, lingers in obscurity.) He&#39;s very friendly and can juggle and can play the flute and is a ninja and he&#39;s AWESOME. He gets along with everybody, so he&#39;d be good at breaking the ice.<br>This would be the best dinner ever!</li>

            <p>Okay, first off I would pick John Watson from the BBC show <i>Sherlock</i>. He&#39;d be pleasant company, and if nothing else, he&#39;d have loads of stories to tell. I only hope that Sherlock wouldn&#39;t somehow manage to join us uninvited, but if he does, well, it&#39;s not like he&#39;d be hogging the food.<br><br>Secondly, I&#39;d pick Richard Castle, from <i>Castle</i>, pretty much for the same reason as John. He just seems like he&#39;d be nice to hang out with, and it&#39;d be fun to see him and John swap stories. Plus, I could grill him for writing tips.<br><br>Thirdly, Raven from <i>Tales of Vesperia</i>, mainly because he&#39;s my favorite character of the current subject of my obsession. Seriously, this guy&#39;s like the physical personification of fun. Schwann&#39;s not invited, though.<br><br>I&#39;m going to add one more place setting, just to prevent this from being a total sausage fest. Abby from <i>NCIS</i> is also welcome dinner company. I think she&#39;d get along pretty well with John and Castle, since they&#39;re all from crime dramas. I&#39;d have to ask Raven to keep the flirting to a minimum, though.<br><br>This was fun!</p>

            <p>True, but the main evening activities would be eating and interacting socially, two things he avoids at all costs. It would be interesting to see him try to deduce things about Raven. Man, would he be confused.</p>

            <p>Hm. Any three from any canon anywhere? I would have to say...<br><br>1) Firion from &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;. At least the way he&#39;s portrayed in Dissidia. Personally, I enjoy political discussions at my dinner table, and it would certainly be nice to see what Firion would our government to be like in comparison to that of Palamecia (US government, that is).<br><br>2) Buddy Sorrell from &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. Although ultimately a personfication of Morey Amsterdam himself, Buddy is sharp-witted and talks in daggers. Which is great, because he&#39;d make a whole bunch of fun at the dinner table.<br><br>3) Lavitz from &quot;Legend of the Dragoon&quot;. No particular reason. I just personally liked Lavitz as a character and companion from the game where he made his brief appearance.</p>

<li>First off, I&#39;d have to got with General Jack O&#39;Neill of the Starate verse. Why? Well, he&#39;s funny, and would help keep the other guests in line especially...<br><br>2. Polonius, of Hamlet fame. The only Shakespeare character I really like, he&#39;d ensure that there would never be a quiet moment, and to be quite frank, watching the pompous windbag interact with O&#39;Neill would make for a very interesting dinner...<br><br>3. Kane, of Command and Conquer fame. What? I want someone to appreciate the amusing situation caused by sticking Polonius and Jack O&#39;Neill in the same room. That, and I&#39;d love to watch him say &quot;Pass the roast beaf&quot; and other such mundane things. I&#39;m sure it would be the most epic meal ever. &quot;You cannot kill the messiah.

            <p>Is it also a dinner for schmucks? ;)<br><br>Anyhow, if I had to pick three people to dine with me...<br><br>1) Katniss Everdeen from <i>The Hunger Games</i>. I&#39;d probably ask her to cook just about everything since she&#39;s experienced with that kind of thing. Yeah, she&#39;d be more than a bit uncouth at the table, but given where she comes from that&#39;s to be expected. Plus, I think she deserves a chance to eat some meal without suspicion of being watched by the Capitol, so that would be welcome for her.<br><br>2) Thane Krios from <i>Mass Effect 2</i>. A mysterious assassin, sitting down and eating dinner would actually be quite nice, especially given that Thane is the most spiritual assassin ever. I&#39;d imagine that the conversations with Thane would kick major ass, so... Yeah.<br><br>3) Myka Bering from <i>Warehouse 13</i>. Because we need more by-the-book Warehouse agents relaxing around the place, that&#39;s why.</p>

            <p>This is absolutely the place for this kind of thing.  I love it.  And now on to the more important question.  Here are my three guests:<br><br>I would go with Saltheart Foamfollower.  He was a Giant of Seareach from The First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever.  He is jovial and the only thing he loves more than telling stories, is listening to stories.  I would want him before he showed up in the books, though, since he got a lot more grim after that.<br><br>He can bring some diamondraught, which is a potent liquor made by the Giants.<br><br>Secondly, I would have to say that Thrall, Former Warchief of the Horde (World of Warcraft).  He is wise and fair.  He has stories, I&#39;ve no doubt, and he isn&#39;t likely to kill anyone unless they are trying to kill him, which is not something that can be said for many Orcs.<br><br>Lastly, I think Thom Merrilin would round out the group nicely.  He is a Gleeman, which is something very similar to a bard.  He sings, he tells stories, he juggles; and that&#39;s just for starters.  He can also hold conversations on philosophy and various other subjects.<br><br>All in all, I think this group would be fun to talk to.  The meal would consist of some kind of roast meat, bread, vegitables, and, of course, the Giantish liquor.<br><br>Good times.<br><br>My alternate (by which I mean Sci-fi) list would include Captain Jean Luc Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise (Star Trek: TNG), Admiral William Adama of the Battlestar Galactica(Battlestar Galactica 2003), and Captain Malcolm Reynolds of Serenity (Firefly).</p>

            <p>The Baker Street Fanfiction Academy&#39;s set in Victorian London, correct?

            <p>Would this be a good place to draw the line between possession and replacement?<br><br>For those that don&#39;t know, the hypnotization rule is that you can never hypnotize someone into doing something that is fully against their beliefs (can&#39;t hypnotize a pacifist into becoming a serial killer etc.)<br><br>So would this be a good way to tell once it&#39;s gone from possession to replacement?

            <p>I think that a possessed character can act like a replacement. Replacements are usually created by extensive Suefluence, meaning that there&#39;s a Sue around. Possession, on the other hand, is where the wraith itself is the source of the OOCness.<br><br>So a character would be unlikely to switch from possession to replacement since that would require the wraith to appear/disappear.</p>

            <p>I have had characters in Bad Slash be replacements. For instance: Holmes is an insecure priest who is victimized by a serial stalker/rapist Watson. Rape is love is the name of the game. Neither character even remotely resembled their canonical selves. I considered these guys to be replacements.<br><br>In another mission, Watson is a sociopathic serial killer, who has been murdering people (in as bloody and gruesome manner possible) for the last ten years, yet Holmes never noticed--Lestrade figured it out first! Holmes is taken down by Watson, but then tracks him to the US (not yet a replacement, due to certain in-character happenings in the stroy, just badly OOC overall). When Holmes contacts Watson it is to join Watson in the killings, which then incites the canonically asexual Holmes into a sexual frenzy. At that point he&#39;s a replacement. <br><br>In a third mission, Holmes is displaying infantile behavior, is unobservant, unintelligent, physically incapable of defending himself, and uninterested in solving crime. At the same time, he is captured, tortured (the plot was to eventually involve box jelly fish), Watson is a jerk to him, and several other things happened that just basically ruined his day. Watson dumps Mary, is a terrible, insensitive, brutal, abusive jerk, and an incompetent doctor. I was entirely ready to kill them both as Stus, but the story just didn&#39;t quite support either of them being Stus. In the end, I had Holmes at 99.99% OOC and Watson at 97.67% OOC. <br><br>In all those missions, the canons were terribly out of character. If I were doing the same missions now, I might  make different decisions. In each case, I thought about it, and made the decision based on what felt right for the story and the mission. Yes, you have to have characters that are <i>way</i> out of character before you can justify killing them, but you can also have characters that are way OOC and <i>not</i> kill them. In the end it&#39;s a judgement call.</p>

            <p>If they wish to hurt someone then that would make it easy for the whatever(in fiction I mean, I know that hypnotism isn&#39;t this strong in real life) because they could just make the person think that everything going on was happening in their imagination, but it wouldn&#39;t work for the purposes of making someone kill the person they love.<br><br>You can&#39;t &quot;force&quot; someone to do something through hypnotization, it&#39;s called power of suggestion for a reason.

            <p>I noticed that sometimes, there are different mini types for the same series--Stargate comes to mind. Do series(es?) get different minis if they focus on different characters (like Power Rangers or YuGiOh), or take place in a slightly different universe (like My Little Pony)?</p>

            <p>I think it depends on the degree of overlap between the spin-offs. Dr. Who has mini-Reapers, and Torchwood has mini-Reapers that can&#39;t fly in a straight line, because it is a spin-off. I don&#39;t know much about Torchwood, but what I have seen of it, it seems to deal with a similar flavor of monsters as Dr. Who does. I don&#39;t know if the mini-Reapers appear in Torchwood or not, though.<br><br>All Stargate canons originally were assigned a single mini, the mini-Mastadge--that slimy water buffalo/camel thing from the movie. That thing might have appeared once on SG-1 and definitely never appeared in SGA. It didn&#39;t make much sense to have a single mini for three canons that didn&#39;t even have a single shared (suitable--the Goa&#39;uld weren&#39;t) monster featured between them, and the style of monster was different in each edition.</p>

            <p>...there is a different mini for each part of the spinoff. I guess &#39;focus on different characters&#39; is the best way to put it. When I have SG-1 characters have their names misspelled in an Atlantis fic, they still get Mini-Unas, and not mini-Wraith. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any official ruling on how series get more than one mini type, but I think a spinoff with a different name helps. Power Rangers and Yugioh both have those, so I would assume it would be possible for them to have more than one mini-type. I dunno, that&#39;s my opinion on the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi there! I found out about the PPC quite a while ago and read through the Original Series, but wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to join just yet. Since then I&#39;ve kept coming back and reading more, and coming back, and coming back, and finally I decided that I was spending so much time here that I might as well join the Board.<br><br>How am I doing so far?<br><br>I like a lot of different subjects including pretty much any fantasy book series (I started reading the Original Series mainly because it was LotR-related) and anything to do with super-heroes (mostly Marvel and DC Comics). I should put together a list sometime, but I&#39;m always reading more, so the list would soon be rendered obsolete. And I love writing, so I&#39;m hoping that after I get the hang of things I can write a mission. <br><br>I really like what I&#39;ve seen of the PPC, and I look forward to getting to know you all!</p>

            <p>It says on the Wiki that SEP Fields can be penetrated by canon characters who are omniscient in some way. What I would like to know is this: Does having the canonical ability to break the fourth wall count as a form of omniscience? <br><br>Ex. Bugs Bunny has been known to talk to the audience and make asides to the viewers of his cartoons on numerous occasions. Since a PPC Agent technically counts as an audience, would he be able to talk to them despite the presence of a SEP Field?</p>

            <p>Only if they aren&#39;t suefluenced, probably. A big difference between medium awareness and omniscience is that a medium-aware character is still at the whims of the plot; they may not know what else is going on in their OWN story or be able to manipulate their medium (&#39;skip ahead chapters&#39;) in a way that could reveal things. The fact that a character might be a Mary Sue or an agent might be there may not occur to them because for all purposes they have the same <i>perception</i> as a normal person even if they have &#39;insider&#39; medium-knowledge.<br><br>In short, while they may know they&#39;re in a story, they are still in the story and wouldn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in scenes where they aren&#39;t there, or know that the PPC is part of the medium they&#39;re familiar with in the first place.<br><br>Besides, lots of characters like this are aware for purposes of humor. So while they might be able to wink sideways at the audience, they&#39;d only be able to do it if it&#39;s funny.<br><br>So Pinkie Pie might be able to make a gag at the agents, but only after she&#39;s no longer OOC and only when it&#39;s funny. Being able to simply see through a SEP field may, or may not be funny. Besides, we aren&#39;t part of HER medium; we&#39;re practically invaders. So while she might be aware that she lives in a cartoon, she might not know WHAT cartoon or that the PPC exists at all.</p>

            <p>Particularly, Yuki Nagato from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.<br><br>Being an humanoid interface of the Sentient Data Entity Whatever, she was able to spot and identify two Agents in a particularly messed up fic (FishCustard&#39;s one with the scenery custard from reality disruption, remember?)<br>The reason given inside is that due to the high RD index, the SEP field stopped working.<br><br>However, being Yuki a sort of autonomous sock puppet of a bigger entity, is it plausible that neuralization only <i>appears</i> to work on her? She&#39;s a taciturn and meek &quot;girl&quot; who isn&#39;t going to talk about things unless needed (well, actually she doesn&#39;t <i>talk</i> at all unless needed), so it would be rather hard to notice that she knows something she shouldn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>In my head-canon, neuralization works on Nagato on a superficial level. Any relevant data would be deleted from her &#39;RAM&#39; as it were and she wouldn&#39;t directly remember anything about the Agents, etc.<br><br>However, anything stored with the Data Integration Thought Entity would be unaffected, so should the PPC return to the Haruhi-verse it would be plausible for her to be able to retrieve this data and have some knowledge of the PPC and &#39;Sues. The fact that Nagato&#39;s faction pretty much exists to constrain crazy events certainly helps in keeping it all hush-hush.<br><br>Just my 2p worth.</p>

When Group B was found being too dangerous the same year, in 1987 they decided to scratch away the idea and go with Group A instead.)<br><br>To get an idea about a Group S car, go google the Lancia ECV. A Lancia Delta S4 on steroids. 700 horsepower, 890 when overboosting, 890 kilograms. No Haruhi, maybe you shouldn&#39;t drive one... Good thing she used a Honda Integra instead.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m having a few issues with the DVD-ROM drive in my laptop.  Specifically, most of the time the laptop doesn&#39;t seem aware that it&#39;s even there.  If the computer <em>does</em> recognize the drive, it tends to &quot;misplace&quot; it ... while I&#39;m trying to use it.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to install a new internal DVD drive.  This laptop is over 3 years old, so I should start socking money away for a new laptop instead.  However, it&#39;s tax season, I can&#39;t find TurboTax in a download-only version, and my desktop can&#39;t run TT any more due to program updates.  So, I&#39;m looking at getting an external DVD drive to tide me over.<br><br>Does anyone have a recommendation on brands to buy/avoid?  Or a recommendation on where to get this?  A friend of mine has a Tiger Direct account, but I&#39;m also seeing these drives in local stores.</p>

            <p>...you might as well try re installing the driver for the DVD Rom drive, if it even has one. If it does not have one that you can find, or it doesn&#39;t work, and you live in the states, do what Dann says. Newegg also has really good sales and deals, sometimes, so you might want to watch out for those.</p>

            <p>Newegg.com is a very good site - I&#39;ve built at least a half-dozen computers with parts from there. They&#39;ve also got customer reviews, which can be useful for knowing what&#39;s worth buying.
