            <p>Hi, guys. *waves* Just wanted your opinion on how to stop yourself from wasting your time on somewhat irrelevant things. I&#39;m pretty sure that I just spent about an hour of scattered time discovering the Cassandra Claire debacle, reading in between other small tasks. Do you ever feel like these things, while fascinating, are really just your idiotic bits *wanting* to find stupidity so you can shake your head at it in an unproductive and unnecessary fashion? If yes, how do you keep yourself writing goodfic and not just tearing your hair out over the bad side of your fandoms and oohing over the shiny side? It&#39;s fun, but it has the flavor of work. Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m incredibly lazy in my free time, but I&#39;m appalled at the amount of time I being a spectator rather than a productive reviewer and writer. <br><br>Ah, yeah, there are probably some people that are wondering why I didn&#39;t formally introduce myself. Hi. I&#39;ve been around a bit before, but I&#39;ve been off-board for a bit, that&#39;s all.<br><br>Virtual chocolate, anyone?<br><br>Oh, and I discovered Serenity/Firefly-verse lately. Like it a lot, generally. Maybe I should&#39;ve put that in a different thread, but then again, I seem to recall strict admonitions on the subject of pushing stuff off the front page with too many threads.</p>

            <p>I have been in the same boat time and time again. I click one link, then another, then boom! Two hours of potential writing time gone. Here are a few practices I&#39;ve taken on in an effort to curb that. Give &#39;em a try.<br><br><b><u>Scheduling</u></b><br>Organize your time. &quot;I&#39;m going to write from this time to this time, have an hour or so to unwind and grab a bite to eat, then resume writing at this time before calling it a day at this time.&quot; Writing it down helps.<br><br>If you need to do research for a specific subject you might be covering, set aside an hour or so before hand. If you&#39;re in the middle of writing when you discover you need to look up a subject, write down what you want to look for on a piece of scratch paper. Then, set it aside until after you&#39;ve finished your allotted writing time.<br><br><b><u>Disconnect</u></b><br>From the internet, I mean. If you&#39;re hooked into a modem or a router, unhook yourself. If you&#39;re on a wireless connection, turn it off. If you can&#39;t go cold turkey, I think there might be parental control softwares you can use to limit your internet usage to a certain amount of hours per day. But don&#39;t quote me on that one.<br><br><b><u>Don&#39;t push yourself</u></b><br>If you really don&#39;t feel like writing, then you shouldn&#39;t force yourself. You&#39;ll only end up with a lackluster product. Just try to relax, finish what you&#39;re doing, and set up a time to get some proper writing done in the future.<br><br>I would also suggest taking a look at Scrivener. It&#39;s a writing program specifically designed for writing projects of all stripes - short stories, novels, scripts, research papers, work reports, and so on. The aspect of it most relevant to what I&#39;ve been talking about is its full-screen editing mode. It&#39;s just like it sounds: the project fills up the screen and can only be dismissed through the escape key. You can&#39;t just click out of it.<br><br>One caveat: Scrivener was originally created for Mac computers. They have a PC version, but I&#39;ve never used it so I don&#39;t know how it compares.<br><br>Food for thought, anyway!</p>

            <p>Phobos is absolutely right. Paper and pen are invaluable. If you&#39;re having trouble focusing on the task at hand, cut yourself off from the source of the distraction. Ninety percent of my writing is done in a plain old composition book, usually while watching TV or relaxing after work; it keeps me from spending too much time in the depths of Cracked or sporking sites.<br><br>On the other hand, that&#39;s not to say that you can&#39;t enjoy the occasional bit of irrelevancy. And I wouldn&#39;t even call the Cassandra Claire mess irrelevant, to be honest--it&#39;s a fascinating study of human foibles and fandom screwups. The Ms. Scribe saga is my personal favorite.</p>

            <p>I learned something about myself last year during NaNoWriMo.  I cannot be trusted with an internet connection, if there is writing to be done.  I spend more time looking at Failblog and Cracked than I do working on whatever I am working on.<br><br>So, how did I fix it?  Simply put: notebook and pen.<br><br>I find that I get far more done if I am writing things out by hand, away from an internet connection.  It is slow going and it is painful, at times.  You have to deal with hand cramps and (in my case) sometimes not being able to read your own handwriting.  In the end, though, it really worked for me.<br><br>-Phobos<br><br>Maybe it can work for you?</p>

            <p>I kind of avoided notebooks during NaNoWriMo because they reminded me of the terribly written first-ever fanfics I wrote (back in the days when I didn&#39;t know fanfiction existed). But that&#39;s an interesting idea.</p>

That, aside from random ideas coming up, is one of the reasons why I carry notebook and pen with me when I go somewhere.<br><br>Alternatively, if you prefer writing at your computer, unplug the internet. Not just deactivating, plug out the cable. Or turn off the wifi. Or router. The more work it is to activate it again, the less inclined you are to do it. And if you have a laptop with a halfway decent battery, go somewhere where you can&#39;t get internet. This is also helpful if you need a new location for fresh inspiration.<br><br>Okay, I was rambling. Make out of this what you want.</p>

            <p>With my chronic laziness, I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m the best person to answer this question, but I&#39;ve found that getting organized really helps when I want to do work.  I set myself a goal, like &quot;I want to write a fic about [insert series you&#39;re currently fired up about]&quot; or &quot;I want to write a fic to practice writing action scenes&quot;.  Then I start sketching out an outline and write myself a little plan so that I&#39;m not just making it up as I go along.  That way, I get to ration the excitement that comes with starting up a new project, and hopefully it goes on for longer.<br><br>Welcome back to the board.

            <p>Hourai is the Japanese name for Mt. Penglai, which is a magical paradise island in Chinese mythology.  The Japanese had a different interpretation of it but it&#39;s basically the same place.  It&#39;s just a different take on the name I go by in other places on the internet, Hourai Rabbit.</p>

            <p>You get tired of beating your head against a wall. Or I did, anyway. I still watch The Daily Show, but I gave up reading badfic, reading fandom_wank, etc. It just gets to be tiring, and there&#39;s enough to be angry over in this world without going out of your way.<br><br>That, and if I spend four hours on my laptop... if I&#39;ve spent four hours writing and, say, building something in Minecraft, it feels good. If I&#39;ve spent four hours reading badfic and going &quot;AAARGH, why would anyone write that?!&quot; it feels like I&#39;ve wasted the day.<br><br>There&#39;s a lot of excellent &#39;fic in Firefly-verse. If you&#39;re into Sandman, search AO3 for &quot;Endless Moments,&quot; it&#39;s a really awesome series crossover with Sandman and Firefly.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a subject that got me thinking for a little while recently - what&#39;s your opinion on writing about stuff you don&#39;t know all that much about?  For example, if you don&#39;t know any particle physicists very well, but you want to make a character a particle physicist.  Do you think it is possible or acceptable to write something that you don&#39;t know about or can&#39;t really know about without experiencing for yourself?  What if you had enough secondhand knowledge to make it sound authentic?  How much secondhand knowledge is needed?<br><br>Inquiring minds want to know.</p>

            <p>It also depends on what the subject is... a scientist in the real world is hard to write unless you know a decent amount about their science (such as, you&#39;ve taken a college course in it at least.) One of my pet peeves with books in the real world is people who write &quot;experts&quot; in a subject that get things you learn in a high school class on the subject wrong. (For example, nuclear radiation is not an infectious disease and is not transmittable by blood... yes, there is a published book where they make that mistake. They also use bio hazard suits. The main character is supposedly a world-renowned expert in nuclear radiation. And the book is a New York Times bestseller, but that&#39;s a rant for another time.)<br><br>On the other hand, if you want to write a teenager who has astrophysics as their main hobby, you can get away with them getting things wrong, because they aren&#39;t expected to be experts by the audience. (Especially if they&#39;ve been researching online.)<br><br>If you have it set in a world that isn&#39;t supposed to represent the &quot;real world,&quot; you get a lot more leeway to make things up. Don&#39;t know much about psychology? A fantasy mind healer doesn&#39;t necessarily have to. Results may vary, but psychology at least is something where proof is hard to come by. Physics is not.<br><br>Long story short, if doing a science, please at least find some recent basic textbooks on it at the library. On the other hand, you can have a person who is a particle physicist and hardly ever mention any specifics of their job if the plot doesn&#39;t require you to do so. I know they make and look at graphs a lot and collide particles comparatively  little. <br><br>Tangentially, I went on a field trip to Fermilab last month and realized that my grasp of particle physics is significantly less than the square root of my reach. </p>

            <p>We were lucky enough to get a visit from sci-fi novelist Kim Stanley Robinson, so we all grilled him for advice on writing.<br><br>One of the subjects we broached was that of research. Being a science fiction writer, of course he had a lot to say about it. One of the things he said stuck with me: he would apparently spend hours researching a certain topic if it was relevant to his story, and more often than not the results of said tireless research would be a few sentences, or a paragraph smaller than the width of three of his fingers. But it was still necessary, because sometimes it&#39;s those few sentences or that small paragraph that enriches the story and makes it more real for the reader.<br><br>So, sometimes it&#39;ll take a lot of research to write only a small part of the story or the setting, but I guess what one must take from this is to be patient, and to give the story the love, care, and effort it deserves, even if it seems like the end result is a lot smaller than you would have liked.<br><br>I know what you&#39;re going through, though. I like to have diversity in my characters, particularly when I write urban fantasy. Lately I&#39;ve been interested in having a main character who is devoutly religious, or a supporting character who is a priest or a minister. I am agnostic. I have no idea how being religious works, or what priests do, beyond what I&#39;ve seen them do on <i>Supernatural</i> (which I&#39;m fairly sure is not a reliable source). </p>

            <p>Research is absolutely key, admittedly, but it can be done. For example, one of my many, many agents is a British soldier from the Special Air Service, something I have no personal experience of. However, I&#39;ve done a hell of a lot of research into the SAS, requested advice from people who know more, etc. and come out with what seems to be a fairly believable mostly-finished product. :P<br><br>So yeah - research and then have a go.

            <p>If you don&#39;t know something, you&#39;ve got the entire internet to do research on. Or, at least, that&#39;s how I work.

As much secondhand knowledge as your brain or harddrive can hold would be my recommendation, though.<br><br>There&#39;s a quote by Thoreau that I think illustrates my point: &quot;Do not worry if you have built your castles in the air. They are where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.&quot; Our theoretical particle physicist character is the castle in the air; the research you need to do is the foundation you should put under it.

London sewers are a <i>fascinating</i> subject, by the way.)<br><br>But that&#39;s just me, and I need to stop rambling and start doing college stuff like I should be.<br><br>-Dragormir</p>

            <p>I prefer to think of the adage &quot;Write what you know&quot; more as &quot;Don&#39;t write what you <i>don&#39;t</i> know.&quot;  If you have a character who&#39;s a particle physicist, but you know nothing about particle physics, you probably shouldn&#39;t write about that - or, at least, not without doing some research.<br><br>Especially for something like particle physics, reading up on it, looking through the internet, or checking out books from the library is a perfectly valid way to know something and therefore write about it.<br><br>As for how much you need to know, that depends on what you&#39;re writing and why, as well as how big of a part it will play in your story, and how much you or your audience will care if you get some details wrong.<br><br>You think, say, Tom Clancy was a spy or a government agent?  No, but he clearly did a <i>ton</i> of research to the point that the government was, according to rumor, worried that he actually <i>was</i> a spy because his books were chillingly accurate.  And Michael Crichton was no mathematician, paleontologist, or biotechnician - he was a doctor - but <i>Jurassic Park</i> was a brilliant piece of work that got very in-depth in... well, what was cutting-edge science at the time, viewed as a bit dated now, but it&#39;s still so good because it&#39;s clear that a lot of effort went into the research.<br><br>You probably don&#39;t need to go to the same lengths as those guys, who are known for showing every single detail of their work.  But a working knowledge of whatever you&#39;re writing about is important.  And if you&#39;re not a particle physicist, and never will be a particle physicist, as a writer you should still know what you&#39;re talking about.  (If you&#39;re actually looking for information about particle physics, I&#39;d recommend Stephen Hawking&#39;s <i>A Brief History of Time</i> - it&#39;s from the 80s, but I think it all still holds.)<br><br>When I was working on my NaNoWriMo a few years ago, for example, I came to a part where I needed to write about black holes.  I had very little idea of how black holes actually worked, so I spent several hours of valuable writing time researching.  In just a couple hours I was by absolutely no means an expert, but I&#39;d learned enough to be able to finish my story.<br><br>As a closing note, I&#39;d just like to say that if everyone wrote from their direct life experiences only, fiction would be a much, much more boring place.<br><br><br>... wow that went longer than I meant it to.<br></p>

            <p>I dislike writing stuff set in the real world for exactly this reason. There is too much stuff to know.<br>However, I always create a world before deciding what I want to write. The more I know about a world, the easier it is to find something to write about. The only downside is that a lot of the stuff I think up doesn&#39;t get used. For example in a story I&#39;m failing to write due to loosing a load of work, I created this huge complex society, based in a swamp and in the &#39;finished&#39; plan the characters don&#39;t even go there. One has a father who came from there, but that&#39;s it.</p>

            <p>So, I was browsing the Harry Potter section out of some sense of masochism when I found <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize">this</a> little gem. It&#39;s a very good story, but you&#39;ll need to keep a box or two of tissues handy.<br><br>It&#39;s called Cauterize, and takes place some time after the Last Battle. It covers a large number of the characters, but Dennis Creevey is the centerpiece. It&#39;s...very sad, but good. Makes the trawling through HP worth it.<br><br>And something a little less sad, but no less good: <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2012/www.fanfiction.net/s/4275069/1/The_Ultimate_Escape_Artist">The Ultimate Escape Artist</a>. Harry becomes an escape artist, and causes Dumbledore a great number of headaches. Requires no tissues, and is really funny.<br><br>I like both of them.</p>

            <p>&quot;Cauterize&quot; was so lovely and tragic... wow.  I love these sorts of stories, the explorations of just what happened after the series ended.  It doesn&#39;t hurt that it&#39;s beautifully written, either.<br><br>Thanks for bringing this to attention; not only is it an incredible story to read, it&#39;s really, really nice to be reminded that there is not only goodfic but <i>amazing</i> fic out there.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve noticed it too.  I really enjoy the series, but I don&#39;t even bother with fanfic.  I think there are several things that lead to Percy Jackson fics being even more riddled with Sues than average.<br><br>One, the series is very welcoming for OCs.  Demigods canonically are reasonably common and can turn up anywhere, anytime.  They also tend to turn up when they&#39;re 12-16 - perfect Standard Sue range.<br><br>Two, these kids that can turn up from anywhere are already by default half-human half-(something super awesome).  This is already a common Sue trait - and this is canon.  It&#39;s also very easy to give these characters superpowers and/or tragic pasts.<br><br>Three, the series is geared towards exactly the age range that writes Mary-Sues the most.<br><br>And, most importantly I think, four: There is a hot single guy.  Never underestimate the power this holds.  Nearly all the PJO Sues I&#39;ve found go after Nico di Angelo.  He&#39;s a hero with a dark past and Kool Goffik Death Powerz.  Think of all the Legomancers in LotR fanfic - Nico is PJO&#39;s Legolas, in this respect.<br><br>(Just putting this out there: I <i>love</i> Nico.  I think, after Annabeth, he&#39;s my favorite character from the series.  Unfortunately, the Suethors seem to share this opinion.)</p>

            <p>As July said: if you think a character you&#39;re writing is OP, it probably is. Other words: It&#39;s really, really, really easy to screw up when writing a demigod and end up with a &#39;Sue/&#39;Stu in your hands. But, as noted elsewhere, OPness does not necessarily mean Sue. Sues have more traits than just OPness.</p>

            <p>As a proud Percy Jackson fan: Most of the campers at Camp Half-Blood don&#39;t have superpowers at ALL. They just have, say, an aptitude for mechanics, over-average intelligence, or are good at healing.<br><br>The problem is the kids of the Big Three gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. There&#39;s only supposed to be one of each in canon, and they *do* have real powers. Strong powers, but not OP by the rules of canon. <br><br>The problem is Suethors only want to write kids of the Big Three, who have all the toys that all the other characters get, all the powers (all of them), and are probably the Oracle of Delphi to boot.</p>

            <p>I was really pretty disappointed with the <i>Heroes of Olympus</i> series.<br><br>I really do love the Percy Jackson series, but I definitely raised an eyebrow at the idea that a sequel seies was coming out.  I thought PJO ended perfectly well, wrapped up, completed, nicely ended.  It didn&#39;t need a sequel series.  But, as a Percy Jackson fan, of course I went and read the new books anyway.<br><br>Honestly, they read like fanfiction of the PJO series.  And not particularly good fanfiction, either.  The characters were flat and had powers that sprang from nowhere and the plot points felt like contrived repeats of PJO stories.  I expected better, really.</p>

            <p>I would like to get permission for a couple of rather unusual agents for the Department of Floaters.<br><br>The Agents:<br><br>Name: Sketch E. Fox<br>Age: 16<br>Species: Cartoon Fox<br>Home Continuum: Disney Multiverse<br>Department: Floaters<br>Partner: Josh<br>Fandoms: Disney, Harry Potter, Mario, Looney Tunes, Muppets, etc.<br>Lust-Objects: None listed<br>Favorites: The Sensational Six (Disney); the Golden Trio, McGonagall, Hagrid, Lupin, Sirius Black, etc. (Harry Potter); Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Bowser, etc. (Super Mario Bros.); among others.<br>Weapons: Hammerspace, mallet, limited resistance to damage, various explosives of dubious origins, cartoon physics (animated continua only)<br><br>Sketch is a cartoon fox, and a former apprentice to a particularly disturbing Witch!Potion Seller!Sue. He has a slim build, wide eyes, and a particularly bushy tail. Often dresses in a pair of gray slacks, a blue waist-coat, a white shirt and a fez. Generally the more energetic of the two, he   tends to ramble a lot, especially when he&#39;s nervous or angry. He also has a tendency to scare easily, and as a consequence, he hates doing missions in horror-themed continua.<br><br><br>Name: Josh<br>Age: 20 (human years)<br>Species: Yoshi (Purple)<br>Home Continuum: Super Mario Bros.<br>Department: Floaters<br>Partner: Sketch E. Fox<br>Fandoms: Various anime and video games, can do Harry Potter or DC Universe in a pinch<br>Lust-Objects: None listed<br>Favorites: Too many to list, but especially the main characters of Super Mario Bros.<br>Weapons: Egg Throwing, Flutter Jump, high agility and strength, sticky tongue (Note that these are only when he is in his usual form. When disguised as a human, or something similar, he generally uses a short sword or a Glock 17C pistol)<br><br>Before joining the PPC, Josh was a Background Yoshi living on Yoshi Island, in the Super Mario Bros. continuum. One day, he took a wrong turn while looking for berries, and accidentally ended up angering a tribe of Spear Guys. While running from the enraged Spear Guys, Josh jumped into a random Warp Pipe, which he hadn&#39;t noticed before. The Warp Pipe turned out to be a plot hole, and he wound up frightening the Cafeteria staff when he burst out of one of the kitchen sinks. After some initial confusion, he was duly recruited into the PPC and paired up with Agent Sketch.<br><br>Josh is a typical example of a Purple Yoshi, right down to the dark red boots that make up the entirety of his casual dress. He&#39;s the more relaxed of the two, and the one who usually has to get Sketch out of trouble. Like all Yoshis, Josh is a big eater, and will try to sneak as much food as he can from various canonical banquets and celebrations. He also has a surprisingly good aim, but only with one-handed firearms or his eggs. Any other weapon, either thrown or fired will miss, no matter what kind of precautions he takes.<br><br>Requested RC Number: 3913<br><br>If you see any way these two characters could be improved, please let me know. Thank you!</p>

<li>I believe that creating a couple of unusual Agents would be an interesting exercise in creative writing: seeing how they would interact, observing the reactions of more conventional PPC Agents, having them adapt to PPC life, and so on.<br><br>2.

            <p>The one thing I noted that you might want to work on is some of Sketch&#39;s rather fast decisions. Not the one to join the PPC, but things like this:<br><br><i>Whoever they were, they knew he was in there. This was not good at all. Sketch knew that if the mistress were to find anybody upstairs, he would be blamed for it. Plus, he had no idea what these strangers wanted. He could only hope that it didn’t involve his getting harmed. <br><br>Whatever the strangers wanted, he wasn’t going to know about it unless he let them in.</i><br><br>That reads as &#39;Oh no, they&#39;re here to hurt me! I&#39;d better let them in&#39; - which doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense. :P There&#39;s a couple of other examples, so make sure your characters&#39; decisions follow a certain logic (even if it&#39;s nonsense logic), but other than that, go for it!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I agree that the sample wasn&#39;t overtly funny (I tend to miss that sort of general thing), but I think it had it&#39;s moments. &quot;There&#39;s been a mistake&quot; was pretty funny.

            <p>Hi, PPCers,<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how many of you are aware of this, but we used to know ourselves not just as PPCers, but as members of the Canon Protection Initiative. What is the CPI? As the Wiki says:<br><br>&quot;The effort put forth by PPCers, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/OFU">OFU heads</a>, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/MST">MSTers</a>, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/GAFF">GAFFers</a>, and all goodfic writers to ensure that a fictional world and all its denizens are treated with respect whenever they are borrowed for fanfiction use.&quot;<br><br>My guess is that most people here don&#39;t know anyone from other canon-protecting organizations. So what happened? Well...time happened. Miss Cam stopped managing the Official Fanfiction Universities, Tviokh left Livejournal and the most popular of the Sue reports, Al&#39;s Waiter hasn&#39;t been seen MSTing in ages, and GAFF has relocated so many times that it&#39;s hard to keep tabs on it. <br><br>Although each of these organizations had different ways of operating, we all shared our love of canon and our hatred of badfic. The fact that we would often intermingle with other members of the Canon Protection Initiative led to the cross-pollination of ideas, which in turn led to better writing and a stronger community.<br><br>I think it&#39;s high time we started making the rounds again. If each PPCer visited another Sue-mocking site once a week--whether to leave a review of an OFU, post a Sue report on <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/deleterius/profile">deleterius</a>, or to create a PPC outpost somewhere else (say, DeviantArt or Dreamwidth)--we could get the circulation of ideas flowing again among the various communities. <br><br>This is, of course, entirely voluntary...but this is an instance where our greater diversity of fandom can work in our favor. I&#39;m sure you all know PPC-friendly places that I haven&#39;t visited, or websites where we could exchange writing tips. For my part, I want to get the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/profile/">Pirates of the Caribbean Mary Sue Report</a> going again, but am short of volunteers, no longer having the time to do all the sporkings myself. We had some great discussions going on, and with rumors of PotC 5 in the works, we&#39;ll no doubt see another onslaught of badfic. <br><br>And as always, we can invite our Canon-protecting brethren to join us here! We have pie. Mmmmm...pie...<br><br>*wanders off to make key limey goodness*</p>

            <p>...hopefully. I mean, it&#39;s not an easy task, and there are a lot of things that can go wrong!<br><br>But if you are interested, there&#39;s a number of ways to watch it, listed in various parts at <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/01/curious-about-curiosity-heres-info-on-where-to-watch/">Bad Astronomy</a>, as well as on the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html">Nasa Website</a>. (There&#39;s also a live feed that appears, at this moment, to be a press conference on past and present Mars rovers, running on the latter.)<br><br>I figure you lot are probably quite interested as well, so - what&#39;re your thoughts on the whole endeavor? <br><br>Personally, I&#39;m hoping there&#39;s a response geared towards human exploration, but that&#39;s probably overly optimistic.

            <p>...really utopian. Sorta shamelessly utopian.<br><br>I mean, it is awesome! And I am pretty sure that is the world we should be working for, and I&#39;d be first in line to head that-a-way to start working. And I am <i>all over</i> trying to work towards Blue Mars on our own blue planet.<br><br>(And oh man, do you know how incredibly comforting it was to read that book and realize ...Oh. This actually sounds sane! So I&#39;m not actually completely off my rocker, there <i>are</i> more people out there who are boggling at the state of the world! Such a good thing.)<br><br>But in reality, I think there&#39;ll be quite a bit more national/corporate tug-of-wars over such a beautiful rock. If we can find - if we can <i>be</i> - a Nadia and an Art and a Nirgal and an Arkady and a John and a Vlad and a Sax and an Ann...<br><br>the world, indeed, all the worlds, will be ours. So that&#39;s where we start, I think. Despite the world right now being a place where the events of the Mars Trilogy would be really tough to achieve, I think if we can muster up the character, the strong ethics, the backbone, and the raw scientific desperate thirst for understanding and innovation, we have a shot. And that&#39;s a lot of what Curiosity seemed to be pushing for! So we are totally moving in the right direction; the future is now, and it is awesome.<br><br>So, in sum, yes! That trilogy. If I ever find myself teaching anywhere, I won&#39;t make it required reading, but I&#39;ll make sure there are lots of copies in tempting, easy-to-reach places, and lots of opportunities for reading. And in another few years, who knows?</p>

            <p>Investigating Mars is fascinating, but I think we&#39;d be better off starting out with lunar colonies before we try moving out that far.  If nothing else, it would give us time to come up with improved radiation shielding -- one news article I read (I think on the BBC webpage) said Curiosity took enough radiation on the trip to take a hefty chunk out of a human astronaut&#39;s career radiation exposure limit, and a human would get even more radiation on the way home.<br><br>I&#39;d love to watch the landing live, but 1) the home connection stinks and 2) I have to get up by 5:30 AM.</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t wait for the data to start coming in! Mars is as close to Earth-like as it&#39;s gonna get in this Solar System, and if we can get a better picture of its geology (historical and present), we might be able to figure out how to colonize and even terraform it. Sure, that&#39;s sci-fi dreams, but we have to start somewhere, right? Plus, maybe we&#39;ll finally be able to pin down those tantalizing hints of life on Mars, at least at some point in the past.</p>

            <p>Well, I try to write, but I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;s good enough to share with such esteemed personages such as yourselves. I have written a bit of fanfic, but I don&#39;t have any original fiction posted on the internet. I feel that I should mention this huge comic I&#39;ve been working on for a few months here. It&#39;s all tucked away in notebooks and I don&#39;t think my art is good enough to carry the story, but I think that&#39;s original fiction. It counts, right? In general, writing-wise I mostly write fanfic. When my fics turn out as I&#39;d like them to they&#39;re usually comedies or adventures, and the big life-devouring comic thing (as I&#39;ve taken to calling it) starts out as a comedy, sort of, and then gets a lot more serious. Well, if you don&#39;t count the preludes for certain characters, which definitely aren&#39;t- no, I&#39;m not going to start. But I guess they usually end up as sort of black comedies, maybe somewhat character driven? I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s hard to separate habit from style. Wow, this ended up long.<br>But thank you!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the rain, I&#39;ve got loads myself but more is always appreciated. And fandom wise, the worst fic offenders are often Doctor Who and Being Human, although it has to be kept in mind that even the premise of Being Human is somewhat cracky, but still. And Supernatural, I would really like to see some Supernatural badfic sues get whats coming to them.  :)</p>

            <p>Since the badfic thread fell off the first page, I&#39;m creating this new one, because I chanced upon this horror while browsing the Pit&#39;s FMA section.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341888/1/Take_me_Back_to_the_Start">Take me Back to the Start</a> (Hebrew version <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341803/1/Take_me_Back_to_the_Start_Heb_Ver">here</a>) by Tamyou<br>Fandom: Fullmetal Alchemist<br>Rated: M (NSFW, Slash. NSFB if you know FMA).<br>Length: 4 chapters. The English version is 11,454 words, the Hebrew one is 8,873 words.<br>Summary: <i>When the enemy inviding Central, Roy have to protect his blond lover. But what&#39;s happened when Edward can&#39;t handle the guilty? YAOI. M\M. character death. a lot of angst. RoyEd. R&amp;R, please! full summery and warning inside...</i><br><br>What is this I don&#39;t even... augh. Edward and Roy are massively, massively OOC – they&#39;re suddenly lovers with no explanation, Ed is behaving like a jealous idiot, everyone else in Mustang&#39;s team are Unrealistically Tolerant Pillocks, Al has his body back (and yet Ed can still practice alchemy), Ed Wangsts, logic&#39;s being thrown out of the window, Riza Hawkeye fires at Mustang, the author&#39;s sockpuppeting Ed in her A/Ns, said author notices that Ed isn&#39;t that angsty and yet continues to write the story... <br>It seems that the author didn&#39;t watch FMA, or read the manga. Just... augh.<br>Grammar-wise, there are some errors in the English version. The Hebrew version hasn&#39;t any that I can find, but is just as bad characterisation-wise.<br>So: should this be killed with fire?<br>Oh, and it&#39;s a songfic, to boot.</p>

            <p>Yay, missions!  My brain has been in mission-reading withdrawal lately, so thank you!<br><br>*reads them on and off all day*<br><br>(I realize most of these missions were written a long time ago, but I read them all for the first time today, so I&#39;m reacting to all of them at once.  Hope you don&#39;t mind.)<br><br>Oh, I like your agents.  They both have strong personalities, and play well off each other.  I especially like the effects of chocolate on Eledhwen, and Christianne&#39;s random Poe-quoting when losing sanity.<br><br>You do a good job of explaining your assassination methods before they come up, so the reader knows exactly what&#39;s happening to the Sue and why it&#39;s an appropriate end.  I especially like the <i>Sherlock</i> Sue&#39;s demise involving the related OFU.  I tend to forget the OFUs exist; I&#39;ll have to work on remedying that.<br><br>I especially like the Narnia mission due to all the detail you supplied for the world, as well as getting across the agents&#39; respect for the world and for Aslan.  I get the same feeling whenever you&#39;re writing scenes in Middle-earth, but I didn&#39;t see it so much in the <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> or <i>Sherlock</i> missions.  That&#39;s unfortunate, as I&#39;m not familiar with the settings of either canon, and I would have liked to see some more of those details in those missions.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m curious.  Is the line, “I doubt that; there was that one Sue who got dropped into the Victorian-era Sherlock Holmes’s bed,” referring to the badfic I&#39;ve claimed on the wiki?  Or is that just a really common trope in <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> Sue fics that I haven&#39;t noticed?</p>

            <p>Um... Hi. I&#39;m Sevenswans. I read a lot of books. (The second part is probably par for the course around here, I have no idea about the first.) I like talking about books, and sometimes even movies. Provided they don&#39;t ruin the book. If you trap me in a linking book I&#39;ll probably die of geeking out before anything else catches up to me, since I&#39;ve been playing the Myst series since I was about seven.<br><br>Oh yeah. I should say how I got here. I&#39;ve done some sporkings with friends, (never give a room full of sarcastic college girls mountain dew and access to the internet at the same time,) and wandered over here after appearing one day at the original series after a prolonged wiki walk that involved TV tropes and a rubber chicken. <br><br>I&#39;ll be on the lookout for badfic and probably pop in here occasionally for other semi-constructive stuff. <br><br>If this is the wrong place to post, I&#39;ll scoot over. </p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC, please leave your shoes and sanity at the door. As a new member you are entitled to a number of things, some of which you have already received like discussions of fandoms and pleas to read the Constitution and the Original Series. One thing that you have yet to receive is a gift from me which I always try to make as relevant or ironic as possible. Since the only fandom I&#39;ve seen that we have in common is Discworld and I can&#39;t think of anything related to that, I grant you some Pockets of Holding* for storing all your new gifts and books that you&#39;re looking to read.

It&#39;s the sequel to Night Watch, so if you&#39;re reading in order you might want to read that first, if you haven&#39;t already.  Anyway, have a diurnal owl.

            <p>All sorts of things, really. Fantasy, mystery, scifi, steampunk... about the only thing I don&#39;t generally read are romance novels or anything categorized as drama.

            <p>It&#39;s the fire marbles that had me stuck in Riven for years. Literally years. I actually finally managed to get Channelwood finished (it&#39;s like twenty times as big as it looks, which is amazing - and I think that Teledahnn (found in Uru) is a deliberate callback to it, since it has a fairly similar aesthetic,) but I can&#39;t get the spaceship opened up.

            <p>Yeah, I can&#39;t even get the rocketship Age open... when I&#39;ve got Myst re-downloaded, I&#39;ll pester you if I still need it. I do remember how to beat Channelwood and Stoneship, at least. <br><br>Oh, and the grate-with-boxes thing. That was really hard the first time. <br><br>After I&#39;ve done Myst I&#39;m going to try to do all the newer ones in order, because I&#39;ve still got Exile and it should run on something in this house. Hopefully my laptop, but you never know.</p>

            <p>Hi there! If you haven&#39;t done so already, read the Constitution (there&#39;s a link in the top of the page). Also, what SingingTheThunder said. Last but not least, have a gift: a cup of green tea. Just don&#39;t let the leaves eat you.</p>

            <p>Oh, so you really want the list, do you?<br><br>In the last few months, I&#39;ve read <br><i>Codex Alera</i> (by Jim Butcher, I&#39;m up to book four)<br><i>Dresden Files</i> (I&#39;m on book five or six)<br>Most of the fourth Pellinor book (not entirely certain I&#39;ll make the effort to find it and finish it out of the library,)<br>A lovely book by Christine Hinwood, called <i>The Returning,</i> which I still need to write my review of, <br>Some noir fantasy detective books by Mark Del Franco (<i>Unshapely Things</i> and <i>Unquiet Dreams,</i>) and <i>Nightlife</i> by Rob Thurman<br>And assorted Terry Pratchett books, along with rereading the Neverending Story again. <br><br>Some of my favorites in the fantasy category will always be the Young Wizards and Diana Wynne Jones (Year of the Griffin and Conrad&#39;s fate in particular stand out among those as favorites,) as well as the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. Oh, and I&#39;m always looking for good steampunk fantasy or non-medieval era fantasy.<br><br>I read a lot of fantasy, sci-fi and mystery, for which you can blame the librarian at my elementary school when she twigged to the fact that books written for first graders annoyed me. <br><br>I&#39;m trying to catch up on the Dresden Files and Codex Alera in particular, as well as... well, I have a list somewhere. Likely taped to the underside of my last desk. I eat a lot of books. I don&#39;t finish all of the series though, because some of them either I forget about when it&#39;s time to find the new one or the first book just doesn&#39;t make an immpression on me.<br><br>So, mention a book, I&#39;ve probably heard of it. Especially in the fantasy genere.<br><br>One book I haven&#39;t read and probably won&#39;t read is any of the sequels to Hunger Games. They&#39;ve been spoiled for me very thoroughly.<br><br>That was probably more information than you really required. At least you didn&#39;t try to pawn man-eating food off on me. :)</p>

            <p>Dark Warrior Rising - No<br>Lord Demon - No<br>Inversions - I swear I&#39;ve seen it, I&#39;d probably remember if I read it.<br><br>Hmmm... I must resume my habit of wandering randomly through the library. On the other hand, I&#39;ve read all the Witch World books, so a lack of randomness for a bit hasn&#39;t hurt me much.<br><br>Have you read <i>Sargasso of Space?</i> (Andre Norton. Except that you can still find it under her pen-name Andrew North.) Or how about <i>The Blue Sword,</i> by Robin McKinley or <i>Sunshine</i> also by Robin McKinley? I can recommend all of those. And <i>The Thief</i> by Megan Whalen Turner, but I know better than to ask about that one. People  either have read it or they get it mixed up with some other book with the word &quot;Thief&quot; in the title.</p>

            <p>I normally read medieval era fantasy, but one good series with a more technical setting is the Engineer trilogy by K. J. Parker.<br>Also have you read any non-Discworld Terry Pratchett books, e.g Nation, The Carpet People or the nome trilogy?</p>
