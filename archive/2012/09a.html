            <p>Hello there, welcome to the PPC. I don&#39;t seem to possess super-magical pockets of awesome that allow me to pull out incredibly awesome, albeit fictional, objects that will bring enlightenment to you and allow for greater understanding of the universe. However, I do possess something slightly less awesome sounding, but still rather useful.<br><br>Here, have my everlasting friendship. All you have to do is sign this contract I&#39;m holding with my wings.<br><br>Anyway, the most important thing to me when writing fiction would be to make your characters three-dimensional. No matter how decent the mechanics of your writing are, no matter how gripping the plot may be, they are worth nothing if you do not have good characters for the audience to root for, or hate, or even just sympathise with.<br><br>Without good characters, your world is nothing.<br><br>And to avoid creating an OC Mary Sue? Don&#39;t do anything to the character that makes it ridiculously unique compared to the main cast, don&#39;t give it all the attention, and make sure everything about it is reasonable according to the laws of the fictional universe you are writing in.<br><br>By the way, here&#39;s a pen for signing the contract.</p>

            <p>Ooh look, a shiny newbie! -tosses graduated cylinder-<br><br>As for your questions, hm. I think one of the most important things to remember when writing fanfiction is the Canon. Always remember the characterisations, the general plotline, even, perhaps, the style of the author if it&#39;s literary. Try to stay true to it, even when you&#39;re writing something extremely AU or cracked up. And for fiction, I&#39;d say find your own voice and stay true to that.<br><br>And with Mary Sues? The surefire sign of a Suvian is when the plot ceases to be about overcoming conflict and centres instead on the problems of one particular character - and those problems are usually petty or something that gets overcome very easily through Authorial Fiat. The form of the character never determines their Suvian status (unless it&#39;s something extremely implausible for the canon they&#39;re in, like anime hair in BBC Sherlock and stuff); the function does.</p>

            <p>Hello! You have little to say about yourself, yes? ^^<br><br>I would say the most important thing when writing fanfiction is to attempt to to write a piece that will display your love for the fandom and glorify rather than mangle the canon - so stay true to the characters and attempt to create stories and original characters that are not detrimental to the integrity of the characters and stories that already exist.<br><br>As for fiction, remain true to your vision, but try to have a fair amount of logic (or whatever would pass for logic in that world) and write with the knowledge that most things in your story should have some reason for happening - be it character development, story advancement, or a show of what is at stake/has been lost/has been gained because of the plot thus far. Some randomness is okay, but even that should have some purpose, however small or &quot;insignificant.&quot;<br><br>I would say the best way to avoid writing a Mary Sue (or Gary Stu) is to remember that no one is perfect and most people have an about-equal mix of good and bad qualities - so instead of a gorgeous, omni-adored, good-with-all-weapons-and-animals character who trips on her own feet at odd times, write a character who some might consider pretty, possesses enemies and reasonable acquaintances, might be reasonable with taking care of cats and handling a smallish knife, and who trips when she&#39;s excited, is socially awkward, and sometimes says things she should keep to herself. And try not to make a karma-Houdini - if the character goofs in a way that would be reacted to in the Real World, have the other characters react reasonably (if she breaks something, they shouldn&#39;t necessarily flog her, but they should be upset if it was important.)<br><br>It&#39;s also useful to remember that writing nobles, royalty, and those with ties to the aforementioned upper classes might be fun, but those in the middle- and lower classes are just as capable of having wonderful adventures of their own - just as long as those adventures are reasonably within the boundaries of a canon&#39;s reality.<br><br>Also, as a shiny newbie, I present thee with a wooden arrowhead I carved with my shoes. Don&#39;t ask how - the story would give you nightmares.</p>

            <p>... but I reckon have several characters and spread your focus between them. That way none of them get all the spotlight and relevant stuff (literal and metaphorical). However, don&#39;t overburden yourself with characters as you end up ignoring most of them and making one or two slightly Sueish.<br>Anyway, newbie gift ... hmmmm? Ah, yes, I brewed my first batch of CAFfine today, so have a couple of flasks of that. Guarenteed to contain only the cutest of Cute Animal Friends.</p>

My email, once again, is guvnorofspace AT SYMBOL HERE gmail DOT PERIOD THING com.<br><br>Ideally, I&#39;d like everyone to have their post card into the mail within a week of getting the address of the person they are sending it to. This is because procrastination is bad! Please let me know when you mail your post cards.<br><br>As to the question of how to address them: If you are not comfortable giving your real name, that is probably okay. Real names are of course ideal, but just a first name and a last initial should work. &#39;Current Resident&#39; I know will work, but that means its legally addressed to anyone living at home with you, so I would discourage that.<br><br></p>

And I don&#39;t mind mailing stuff far! Mailing to Britain (and anywhere else that&#39;s not U.S./Canada) costs $1.05 US. As long as everyone knows that&#39;s a &#39;risk&#39; they&#39;re taking.

            <p>That I had already heard of the Dragon Ball Z/ Anne Frank one. I had been looking for dramatic readings of bad fanfics and when I listened to that one I couldn&#39;t stop laughing. It&#39;s just too horrible not to be funny. Also, that Death Note/ Tetris one is both the weirdest and the most plausible in my opinion because Mello already acted like he was on something during the manga.</p>

            <p>In a weird juvenile way, I guess it kind of makes sense. When you read her diary and you know she died in the holocaust, you want to save her. And if you happen to be a Dragon Ball Z fan, maybe you write a story where Goku goes and saves her and they live happily ever after. However bad the writing, I can sympathize with the desire to change history and make it all better somehow.</p>

            <p>So I got to thinking, these flash patches our favourite agents use - they&#39;re pretty old, right?

However, I hope that everyone can still perceive the originals that have been reduced to their essential components in this long-overdue revamp.<br><br>Ladies and gentlefolk, I present for your (hypothetical, since I really doubt this would fly) approval, the <i>new</i>, <b>sleek</b> and <u>modern</u> symbols of... the Departments of the Board of Flowers.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ModernPatches.gif"><br><a href="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ModernPatches.gif">Here</a><br><br>hS, muckin&#39; about</p>

            <p>Are mostly that they don&#39;t really mean anything. They&#39;re just a bunch of fancy squiggles, no offence meant. They&#39;re pretty, but people wouldn&#39;t look at them and say, &quot;Oh, a potted cactus.&quot; or &quot;Oh, it&#39;s a rubber duck with three eyes.&quot; they&#39;d say, &quot;Oh, what a nice pin you have there, what department are you from?&quot;<br><br>I understand that some (read: most) of the patches don&#39;t have any meaning that correlates with their jobs but they were funny and we could pretend they had metaphorical meaning. The ones that did make any sense, like DoGA and the Department of Technical Errors, will lose their meanings to the squiggles.<br><br>Also, the DoSAT one looks like a slightly crooked treble cleft. Just putting that out there.</p>

            <p>The Uncommon Comma was hopping mad.<br><br>Bouncing agitatedly on its tail, the Comma finished cataloguing the monstrosity. Even the Division of Multiple Offenses wouldn’t suffice for this…plague…upon not one canon, but <i>four</i>. Besides, there was often no Sue for the DMO to kill. No, this was a job for the Department of Technical Errors. <br><br>Unfortunately. Very unfortunately.<br><br>The Uncommon Comma was inwardly divided between urging its agents on to greater heights of pain and destruction for the unholy spirit of Author-Wraith, and bemoaning the fact that it was the DTE’s responsibility alone. There were only four agents and two recruits—and the recruits were still in Medical, being treated for Post-Mispelled Monkey Distress Disorder. <br><br>Feeling what was not quite a twinge of regret for dumping this odious task on Mara and Isaiah, the Uncommon Comma sent the report.<br><br>*   *   *
<br><br><b>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeuuuuuuurghargle!</b><br><br>Isaiah was startled from his nap by the heretofore unheard-of sound of the Console throwing up. Patting the abused piece of machinery consolingly, Isaiah plopped down in his chair, and somewhat fearfully brought up the mission report.<br><br><b>Will’s Lover.</b><br><br><i>Oh, great,</i> thought Isaiah. <i>Another POTC bad slash fic.</i><br><br>Then he saw the link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1422531/Wills_Lover"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1422531/Wills_Lover">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1422531/Wills_Lover</a></a><br><br>“An <i>author?</i>” wondered Isaiah. “Why would I get a link to an author? And hey, why is there no mission summary here? I mean, it can’t be so bad that the console can’t process it…”<br><br>He clapped his hands over his mouth. He could hear the Laws of Narrative Comedy give him a smirk of triumph.<br><br>*   *   *
<br><br>Bang. Bang Bang. BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG.<br><br>Mara was trying to beat her sock drawer into submission when her partner started pounding on the door. At least, she assumed it was Isaiah. The only other time someone had hammered that loudly was when a line break of rogue tildes had followed her back from a mission and she’d…borrowed…a tazer from Techno-Dann. <br><br>The agent had barely opened the door when Isaiah shot through the opening like a rabid squirrel. Even more disturbingly apropos to this analogy were the wild chittering noises he was making. Without the slightest reserve, he grabbed her chair and brought her console out of “sleep” mode.<br><br>“Panic attack or manic attack, partner?” Mara asked him.<br><br>“B-b-b-bad…grammar…”<br><br>“Yes, I gathered that.”<br><br>“P-p-plot makes no sense…”<br><br>“Which holds true for most of our missions.”<br><br>“Unreadable.”<br><br>Mara blinked as Isaiah gained coherency. Unreadable. Well. That was something one didn’t see every day. “What’s it called, Isaiah?”<br><br>“They. What are they called.” Isaiah swiveled around to meet her gaze. “It’s an author’s name, Mara. There are <b>35</b> stories on this mission report. Here, have a sample.”<br><br>Mara squinted at the excerpt, trying to translate it into something coherent.<br><br><b>Miley&#39;s Prov:<br>I said &quot;well baby…. I am just scared I mean what if we mess up on raising our son/daughter? Or even now we could mess something up. What do I do Baby?&quot; He chuckled and said &quot;Who needs a hug?&quot; I said &quot;Me&quot; I fell into his arms and he put his arms around me and said &quot;Calm down We won&#39;t mess up on it I promise.&quot; I pulled away and smiled. Then Lily and Oliver came in. &quot;Hey Lily Oliver&quot; Jake and I said happily. &quot;Hey. Guess what.&quot; They said. &quot;HMMMMM You and Oliver are idiots?&quot;</b> <br><br>“<i>Thirty-five?!</i>” Mara tried to steady her nerves. Even a veteran PPCer wasn’t used to something like this. “Which fandom? Who’s Miley?”<br><br>“Shows how much you know about the pop culture scene,” Isaiah chided her. “We’ve been recruited into Hannah Montana.”<br><br>“Urk.”<br><br>“And Pirates of the Caribbean.”<br><br>“No way!”<br><br>“And Mulan.”<br><br>“She defiled a non-Sueish Disney heroine? How dare she!”<br><br>“And…” Isaiah bit his lip, hoping she wouldn’t shoot the messenger. “Little House on the Prairie.”<br><br>Mara’s entire body tensed. “Please tell me you mean the TV show.”<br><br>“No. I mean the beloved children’s classic, Little House on the Prairie. Just one of the badfic author’s 35 little banes to canon.” <br><br>“LITTLE? This is some of the worst language I have ever seen!”<br><br>“Uh, I mean the length.” Isaiah turned back to the screen and scrolled down. “Not one of these is over five pages.”<br><br>“So, let me get this straight. The Uncommon Comma, may it rot in the bog of eternal stench, has asked us to go fic-hopping through thirty-five atrocities? We’ll never survive all of that!” Mara fumed. “I’ve grown rather attached to what’s left of my sanity.” Her eyes gleamed as a diabolical plan began to hatch. “Unless…”<br><br>*   *   *
<br><br><b>Attention, New Recruits!</b><br><br>The Department of Technical Errors has decided to assist the Department of Personnel with agent training! The missions in question will be much shorter than your average PPC’d fic, as part of the DTE’s plan to bring the newcomers gently into the fold. The mistakes are also very easy to spot in these missions, and cover a wide variety of fandoms. <br><br>It is our belief that these “training missions” will be useful to help new agents adjust to the PPC. Veteran agents may also apply if they wish, but do so at their own risk.<br><br>Please volunteer in the thread below! (And do ignore the evil cackling emanating from this post. It is completely unrelated to you.)<br><br>~Araeph<br></p>

            <p>(By the way, if any new victi--er, recruits--still want to volunteer, there&#39;s still time!)<br><br>Since most of these abominations are short, I was thinking that we could assign three of them apiece to you : your agent pairs will be split up for training. For one mini-mission, each recruit will be under the supervision of Mara and Isaiah, and for the third, the two recruits will have a go at the author-wraith/canon Sues together. (For the more experienced agents, they can just have Mara and Isaiah around for mental support for two missions to prevent insanity. Ah, the perks of being a veteran.)<br><br>To help facilitate writing, I suggest meeting with the volunteers in the IRC - maybe a group chat for whoever&#39;s available, followed by individual chats scheduled whenever we have time. That should give us a good foundation for this mission-training exercise.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>...there&#39;s a difference between someone who has not yet applied for Permission using this as a Permission request piece, and someone who has been denied Permission three times doing the same thing. <br><br>Your last Permission request was two and a half weeks ago. I hesitate to believe that your writing--or anyone&#39;s writing--can make a dramatic improvement in that short amount of time. In fact, I don&#39;t think you believe it, either.

Participation in this literary criticism implies that you are not only familiar with the basics of grammar, storytelling, and your chosen canon, but that you understand all three at an <i>advanced level.</i><br><br>There is nothing wrong with not being at an advanced level. However, several Boarders on multiple occasions have told you that you have not reached that level yet. I will respect their wishes, and I ask that you do the same.<br><br>Araeph</p>

            <p>This post comes very close to outright flaming and advocation of violence against authors, neither of which the PPC condones - or, even more importantly, neither of which the PPC <i>is about</i>. I&#39;m already a little dubious about &#39;We must destroy everything this author has written!&#39; in principle - specifically the potential for author-bashing it introduces - but your post has edged a little beyond that. Only a little, so I&#39;m not going to start demanding immediate retractions/abdications/self-immolations or anything - but a little. So keep an eye out for that next time.<br><br>hS</p>

And she possesses an improbable weapon and magical talismans that give her the mana of a demi-god at least...)<br>--An OOC Rhonin who does not get angry when she beats the tar out of several magi of the Kirin Tor and allows his &quot;dear friend&quot; to be stupid and go through her newly-created portal to who-knows-where<br>--A mucking-about of the timeline of the <i>Naruto</i> continuum and the lifespan of at least one major supporting character - Jiraiya was <i>not</i> alive to have Naruto cut a waterfall in half, much less teach him what element his chakra <i>is</i><br><br>There are probably a lot more, but it&#39;s taking me a while to finish chapter one.

            <p>I keep on seeing it as a Sue-trying-to-change-Sherlock-Holmes sort of song, even if it&#39;s a lovely piece (a lot of these songs are good yeah?)<br><br>B-side is mostly just a general Sue parody side, from the Sue being viewed as a prima donna slut (first two pieces), to confused canon characters (I&#39;m So Sick and You Don&#39;t Know Me), to pissy canons whose relationships were messed with (Better Than Revenge), to the PPC (I Can&#39;t Decide).</p>

            <p>I know! That&#39;s what threw me off at first - I really, really like most of these songs, but then I remembered the lyrics to &quot;Give Your Heart A Break&quot; and applied them to Boromir (not sure why he came up first), and I realized the awful truth.<br><br>-sighs resignedly-</p>

            <p>Using a pair of agents who haven&#39;t gotten out much... and are actually quite fun to work with.<br><br>(Disclaimer: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7780218/1/Black_Rose">Black Rose</a> belongs to its author. LotR belongs to Tolkien. Takua and Jareth created by Rath, written by me)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;I still say you cheated.&quot;<br><br>The voice was a low rumble - even lower than you&#39;re imagining. It was followed by an exasperated tut from a different source.<br><br>&quot;You would say that, Naz-mini - you lost.&quot;<br><br>In the darkness, the owner of the first voice growled. &quot;I would not have lost had you played fair. I am by <i>far</i> the superior player.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your logic is circular,&quot; the second voice told it bluntly. &quot;I won. You clearly-&quot;<br><br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP]<br><br>A white light filled the room as the console screen flickered into action, revealing the pair of DOGA agents seated on the floor, various playing cards scattered across the floor between them. The smaller of the two - a woman with distinctly green colouring - rose with a sigh and looked at the message.<br><br>&quot;A Mary-Sue,&quot; she said, rolling her eyes. &quot;Oh Jareth, catch me - I think I shall quite faint with shock.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In your dreams, Takua,&quot; her Uruk-Hai partner sniffed. &quot;What are we going in as?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aren&#39;t you even going to ask what canon?&quot; Takua protested. Jareth growled.<br><br>&quot;I assumed the disguise would contain a hint or two about that. Was I wrong?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... not really,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Kyaris from Intel recommends Nazgul.&quot;<br><br>&quot;An excellent choice,&quot; Jareth declared, &quot;provided, of course, we take real swords, not those foolish dissolving things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, Naz-mini,&quot; Takua grinned, &quot;homesick, are we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Please do not call me that. I might be forced to do something you&#39;ll regret.&quot;<br><br>-<br><br>Aragorn and Faramir rode across a landscape that couldn&#39;t seem to decide on the weather. Takua threw back her hood, revealing her distinct lack of head, and scowled at the Words. &quot;Snow on the ground two months after the end of the War? That makes it May, sweetie. Learn to count.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I fear that may not be her worst offence,&quot; Jareth murmured, as Aragorn and Faramir passed, peering at the ground. &quot;Have you noticed? They&#39;re out here because they &#39;just want a brake&#39;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I doubt they&#39;ll find one,&quot; Takua agreed. &quot;They- what in--?&quot;<br><br>Turning to find a quintet of black horses flogging themselves behind a bush was not on Agent Takua&#39;s to-do list when she joined the PPC. &quot;Okay, &#39;horse beats&#39;, I get it,&quot; she muttered. &quot;But the cloaks...?&quot;<br><br>Aragorn and Faramir, champions of Animal Rights, charged towards the bush - and the horses leapt out on their hind legs, the black cloaks hiding their shape as they surrounded the pair.<br><br><i>five horses bursted from their hiding places, surrounding the men,</i> the Words declared. <i>They were the Nazgul, or Ringwraiths.</i><br><br>&quot;That... is not entirely normal,&quot; Jareth said faintly as Aragorn leapt from his horse, grabbed a nearby mini-Balrog (wincing at the heat) and threw it at the Nazgorses - and <i>then</i> reached for his sword. The sun, as if realising what kind of story it was in, plummeted towards the horizon, setting just in time for the battle to start.<br><br>Takua called to the bewildered-looking mini, Aduril, and then swore softly and ducked into the bushes for the arrival of the Sue. It was... probably not entirely how the writer intended it.<br><br>Aragorn and the lead Nazgorse charged each other - and then slowed, bringing their swords gently into contact. At the first touch, a rider rode up on a (quadripedal) black horse, wielding a blue short sword. The lead Nazgul took a step back, slashed his sword at the air - and then all five Nazgorses collapsed. Faramir, who until now had managed to stay in the saddle, leapt to the ground - only to find the Nazgul back on their feet, ambling vaguely towards him. The two Pyros glowered at the offending passage:<br><br><i>When their two blades began to meet, another person came galloping up on a black horse. His blade was glowing blue, much like Sting. With a slash, the Nazgul fell down, dead. The ranger jumped off of his horse. The Nazgul walked toward him.</i><br><br>&quot;Run! Make it safely to Gondor, Heir of Isildur,&quot; Faramir commanded - and, for some reason, Aragorn obeyed, climbing back onto his horse and galloping off. Faramir, in a twist that should have been far less surprising than it was, dropped to all fours and galloped after him. Takua exchanged a look with Jareth as the Nazgul eyed the one remaining character - the mysterious arrival who was sitting quietly in his saddle, staring at the ground.<br>&quot;This is the Sue, right?&quot; Takua said uncertainly. Jareth nodded slowly. &quot;Right. Then she&#39;ll catch up with us. Come on, let&#39;s portal.&quot;<br>-<br>The portal brought them out a league away, where Aragorn and Faramir had settled down to lunch - or supper, given the sun&#39;s earlier antics. Jareth scowled at them from behind a rock. &quot;Three miles and they think they are safe?&quot; he hissed (he would rather have growled, but Nazgul disguises are tricky things). &quot;Do they remember nothing about the War?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Apparently they remember that the Nazgul ought to be dead,&quot; Takua said, eavesdropping on their conversation.<br><br><i>&quot;It is impossible.&quot; Faramir mumbled.<br><br>&quot;Not quite. There is someone else controlling them, a new Dark Lord.&quot; A voice said from behind them.</i><br><br>&quot;Oh, hey, survival instincts,&quot; Takua commented as the pair jumped up, drawing their swords. At her side, Aduril did a little dance at seeing his namesake weapon. Jareth scowled and shook his head.<br><br>&quot;Not so,&quot; he said. &quot;Her - I beg your pardon, <i>his</i>, since two wilderness-hunters are apparently incapable of discerning her gender - eyes emit that ghastly green glow, and yet they...&quot; He trailed off as the two men lowered their weapons in response to the Sue&#39;s apology. &quot;Well, that, in fact.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And I&#39;d just got my hopes up and all,&quot; Takua muttered. The Sue gave the canons an &#39;elfish&#39; greeting, which they apparently recognised enough to return it, and after some inane, badly punctuated dialogue, they sat in merciful silence while the King of the Reunited Kingdom did the cooking. Takua shook her head in disgust. &quot;There is <i>so</i> much wrong with that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Surely it should please you,&quot; Jareth pointed out. &quot;Men doing traditional women&#39;s work - is that not one of your, ah, &#39;things&#39;?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but unlike some Sues I might name, I know the difference between reality and canon &#39;verses,&quot; Takua retorted. &quot;Feminism is awesome-&quot; Jareth let out something that sounded suspiciously like a laugh, and Takua scowled at him before continuing, &quot;-but this is Middle-earth in the early Fourth Age. The most feminist character around was a suicidal cross-dresser; the concept of &#39;women&#39;s work&#39; is definitely alive and well. And don’t get me <i>started</i> on the class issue-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don’t intend to,&quot; Jareth cut in hurriedly. &quot;Do you have your Sindarin dictionary?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course!&quot; Takua exclaimed, affronted, but then frowned. &quot;Somewhere. Probably. Why?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She claims her name to be &#39;Tinnu&#39;, which Aragorn recognises as meaning &#39;Starlight&#39; - and elvish.&quot; Jareth shrugged. &quot;It seems unlikely to me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And me,&quot; Takua agreed. &quot;It doesn&#39;t <i>feel</i> like an Elvish word, at least - and it&#39;s a stupid name.&quot;<br><br>Jareth nodded. &quot;A charge, then.&quot; He scrawled a string of Cirth in his notebook - he never had bothered to learn the Latin alphabet - made an additional note on the summoning of &#39;Minis Tirith&#39; and the old favourite &#39;Rivendale&#39; (who joined Aduril in a game of see-who-can-lob-a-fireball-nearest-the-Sue-without-her-noticing), and hovered his pencil, waiting.<br><br><i>&quot;My name is Dinuviel, daughter of Tinuviel and Beren.&quot; She said, her voice as assertive as Aragorn&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;My lady, the rumour you say is quite only had a son, by the name of Dior.&quot; Faramir said.</i><br><br>&quot;... whaaaaaat.&quot; Takua shook her head slowly. &quot;Faramir... okay, Jareth, <i>how</i> has he managed to mangle the language that badly and <i>still</i> make more sense than the Sue?&quot;<br><br>Jareth tilted his head and watched the Gondorian closely. &quot;He fights it,&quot; he said thoughtfully. &quot;He tries to overcome her influence and reclaim his sanity, but he is overwhelmed.&quot;<br><br>Takua&#39;s invisible lips set into a thin line, and she half-pulled her Morgul blade (&#39;borrowed&#39; from an uncanonical tenth Nazgul on a previous mission) from its sheath. &quot;Then we&#39;ll help him out,&quot; she promised.<br><br>Jareth shook his head and reached across to stop the motion. &quot;Not yet,&quot; he said gently. &quot;We have to wait for the geographical charge.&quot;<br><br>Takua blinked. &quot;I thought that was the messed up Gondorian climate,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;No. There is worse to come. She-&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;The Shadow Sword is the only person who can kill a Nazgul without catching the black breath. In the first age, a young maiden called Aranormidel was abducted by the Nazgul on the day of her wedding. They took her to Mordor, after killing the rest of the guests. When they struck her with a one of their blades, she knew she was to become of the shadow. With her last strength, she raised her blade and pierced her own heart, causing her death. The Valar never had seen such sacrifice and let her become the first twice born. Now the blade and wielder are the only things that can kill a Nazgul.&quot; Aragorn said.</i><br><br>&quot;... by the Kindler and the Weeper, you are <i>such</i> an idiot.&quot;<br><br>Aragorn, Faramir, and their companion turned to stare at the dark shape stalking out of the bushes - or shapes, since there were two of the cloaked figures, not to mention a trio of burning creatures behind them. &quot;The Nazgul return.&quot; Tinnu gasped. &quot;I thought I had killed them all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Like I said, you&#39;re an idiot,&quot; the first Nazgul repeated in a strangely feminine - and coherent - voice. &quot;Jareth, charges, quick form.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tinnu,&quot; the second Nazgul snarled, and <i>his</i> voice was far more what they were expecting, &quot;AKA Dinuviel, AKA the Shadow Sword of Gondor, you stand accused by the Protectors of the Plot Continuum of altering the climate and history of Middle-earth, mutilating every language you come into contact with, abusing the characters of those around you, and claiming powers far beyond your right.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And,&quot; the first hissed - but not a proper Ringwraith hiss, Aragorn and Faramir noted with distress - &quot;being so utterly devoid of even the least modicum of understanding as to think that Gondor, the Nazgul and the land of Mordor existed <i>during the First Age of the Sun</i>! It is <i>not</i> hard to understand the histories involved, and the very concept of Ringwraiths more than a thousand years before the Rings were forged-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I had actually covered that under &#39;altering history&#39;,&quot; the second Nazgul noted, &quot;and your concern for the &#39;quick form&#39; would be more believable if you hadn&#39;t just ranted for longer than my entire charge list.&quot;<br><br>Tinnu had had enough. She drew her blue-glowing sword and charged the Nazgul - who, quite unfairly, blocked her sword.<br><br>&quot;Oh, really, how rude,&quot; the Nazgul said mildly. &quot;I didn&#39;t even get to sentence you to death.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the name of Aranormidel,&quot; Tinnu gasped, &quot;yield and die!&quot;<br><br>&quot;By Elbereth and Luthien the Fair,&quot; the Nazgul retorted, &quot;and for the honour of all Arda... <i>you first</i>.&quot; She shoved against Tinnu&#39;s sword, giving her the opening she needed. The Shadow Sword of Gondor drew her blade back for a high, decapitating swing, and never did figure out why her arm came off at the shoulder before Takua&#39;s blade flicked back and took off her head.<br><br>The PPC agent poked the body with her toe and sniffed. &quot;Idiot,&quot; she said again. &quot;Doesn&#39;t have the faintest idea what an &#39;opening&#39; actually looks like, and thinks huge sweeping moves are the way to fight. Pure pointless grandstanding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;On which subject,&quot; Jareth replied, watching as Aragorn and Faramir - now released from the Sue&#39;s influence, and once more unaware of the Protectors&#39; presence - made their way to their horses and rode off towards Minas Tirith, &quot;might your, ah, impromptu banter with the Mary-Sue be considered &#39;grandstanding&#39; also?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Impromptu, nothing,&quot; Takua corrected. &quot;She insulted Luthien and the Valar, so I invoked them at the end. It was all planned, my dear Jareth, every word.&quot; She looked at the corpse and sniffed again, before turning to her attention to her Remote Activator and muttering with an air of finality, &quot;... <i>idiot</i>.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>Nicely done.  The grammar was absolutely awful - I have no idea how your Agents got through the &#39;fic before the world turned upside down (or something equally crazy) as a result of bad grammar.

            <p>Though it can be hard, the ideal situation is one where the character has flaws that go beyond the superficial, such as prejudice, bitterness, or lack of empathy, and they slowly attempt to create it through out the story. Most good characters are not bad people just because of their character flaws, just not as good as they could be. By the end of the story, the character should have developed to be a better- or worse- person. They will still have their flaws, but they will have changed in some shape or form. Static characters are the exception of course, but no one wants a static character as the focal point of their story. <br>     Even a static character should be well balanced though. In the end, there&#39;s a lot to mess around with, so experiment with different types, backgrounds, and things &#39;till they begi to fit into place.<br>    If this had nothing to do with the question, I&#39;m just going to hide behind my balrog now.</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve seen of anti-Sues, most of them are written by people who have written Mary Sues before and have received negative criticism, so they try and make their character as non-Sueish as possible. Unfortunately, most authors focus on the physical traits: making their characters ugly screw-ups who have no manners, and don&#39;t realize that they still have a character that gets everything they want, has their lust object fall for them, and totally one-ups the canon characters. The only instances I can think of for a good anti-Sue would be if the character was used for comic relief (my mind drifts to Nobby Nobbs).</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a point of principle with me that <i>everything</i> is possible to write well and believably. Girl Falls Into Middle-earth? <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1690622/1/Dont-Panic">Easy!</a> (Actually I doubt it was easy - Boz put a heck of a lot of work into that story). So yes, I would say it could definitely be done - but it would take, as you say, a character-driven author to do it, and most authors aren&#39;t. Plot twists take precedence over character growth. Heck, I&#39;m currently actively trying to write a genuine evolving character, and I&#39;m still finding most of his change turning into Epiphany Moments. That&#39;s <i>not</i> how people actually change - but it&#39;s an easy literary shorthand.<br><br>(For my money - and I&#39;ll have to poke at this on the next draft - the way to do it is to make his <i>actions</i> separated by epiphany-type shifts, but to make his <i>thoughts</i> change gradually in between. Thus keeping the narrative convenience of &#39;Gasp! You&#39;ve never said you cared before!&#39;, but without the audience reaction of &#39;Gasp! Why in the world do you care now?&#39;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Basically an anti-Sue is rather obvious (and a bit mistaken) attempt to be as much the opposite of a Mary Sue as the author can manage.<br><br>For example, if a Mary Sue is beautiful, wonderful with all living creatures, and perfects every skill within a matter of hours at most, an anti-Sue is hideous (for many reasons), hates all living creatures with a possible exception of a few people he/she respects, and fails miserably when trying to learn a new skill (and has taken literally years to learn to, say, tie his/her shoelaces).<br><br>From what I can tell, an anti-Sue comes from the mistaken belief that the opposite of perfection is perfectly opposite, rather than imperfect. I&#39;ve seen one or two reasonable anti-Sues, but most of the ones I&#39;ve come across are somehow even more annoying, as the canon still goes out of its way to make things easy for them, and despite the increased amount of wangsting, the canon characters are all still fawning over them.</p>

            <p>I was walking through the &#39;net one day...<br><br>...When I bumped into the PPC along the way.<br><br>Hello, fair people of human, elven, dwarven, and whatever-you-are-en descent! &#39;Tis I, everybody&#39;s favorite Teh Specs! (I didn&#39;t spell that wrong. My full internet name is Teh Almighty and Glorious Specs of Poor Sightedness. But that doesn&#39;t apply here!)<br><br>So, I was perusing some websites once upon a three years ago and came across one called TV Tropes, wherein I discovered the PPC. It was not until quite some time later that I wanted to join, but alas - I possess naught but a cell phone!<br><br>It is extraordinarily hard to internet on my phone, so you can imagine the amount of difficulty I had in writing this note.<br><br>Nonetheless, I will endeavor to not become a lurker like I usually tend to do.<br><br>Also, it was totally KittyNoodles&#39; fault that you are now forced to put up with me, so righteous eggings are indeed in order.<br><br>Again, hallo!</p>

            <p>Welcome a-Board, newbie of some relation to sort-of-newbie KittyNoodles. I feel somewhat belated in posting this, but I think that&#39;s just because of the posting spree you went on while I was away doing stuff in places. <br><br>A few links I feel I should point you towards would be the the ones for the Constitution, the IRC, and the Wiki, up top. The Constitution contains pretty much all of the rules for our community and should be worshiped with the utmost piety (unless of course you know how to detect a joke, in which case just follow the rules). I see you said that IRCs aren&#39;t really your thing, but it&#39;s a good place to go if you just want to talk or share random links like you&#39;ve been doing above. The Wiki is a place for information on basically everything. If you ever have a question, the Wiki is the first place to go, especially about stuff like Permission and other procedures. Other than that, this is the Board where I lurk most of the time. Beware of carnivorous plants.<br><br>So to end my rant and fulfill the tradition of gift giving for newbies, I hand you this bag-o-stuff that I got from my journey to the dark forests of nowhere. I includes a water gun, an oar, and a Italian-English dictionary. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Season 3 of MLP:FiM starts sometime soon. We have not been given a definite release date, but it&#39;s coming. After the opener is aired I can say with a great degree of certainty that there WILL be a fanfiction explosion, especially with the comics coming out in November. People, keep an eye out for sporkable badfic on all possible sources, maintain a watch on known and repeated badficcers, and write goodfi...il your hands cramp. I don&#39;t have permission yet, so I rely on others who work the continuum to make fun of badfi...il I <i>can</i> come in and spork.<br><br> Also, Glyph, Iron Gall, if you can see this, please update the OFU. I&#39;m dying for a new chapter of that. Burnsie, Kit, if you see this... Work on OFUR? Please? I know you guys have life to attend to, because so do I. But please, try and find time. Even updating once in a month...<br><br> I know I haven&#39;t been on the Board in a while, but I&#39;ll be trying to hang out here more- get known, you know? Well, happy sporkings!</p>

            <p>The third generation of &quot;My Little Pony&quot; was poorly done.  The characterization was shallow, the episodes didn&#39;t have any good plots, and the animation was so cutesy that it was hard to look at.  <br><br>Lauren Faust, the lady who created the current generation of MLP, noticed this.  She had grown up with and enjoyed the first generation of MLP and didn&#39;t like what G3 was doing.  When she started her work of G4, she focused on such things as good characterization and good writing.  She also designed the show so that older people could watch the show without feeling nauseated.  Ms. Faust also made the show funny, which helps a lot.  <br><br>That&#39;s about as best I can explain it.  </p>

            <p>So, I am an avid writer of stuff. Most of it is fantasy stuff, but I&#39;m willing to tamper elsewhere if I feel up to it.<br><br>Many of my stories, written, finished or hanging, are ridiculous, nonsensical and just plain impractical, all for the sake of comedy value.<br><br>However, there is one thing that I try and enforce in most of my work: a steep avoidance of really popular tropes listed on TV Tropes.<br><br>Like, for example, Katanas Are Just Awesome, wherein having a Latasha makes you instantly the greatest character in the story. I went out of my way to make katanas sucky and impractical if I can.<br><br>My big question is: is my tendency to veer away from popular cliches a bad move on my part, akin to botching a continuum and writing Mary Sues?<br><br>I still plan to follow this trend of mine, but I want to see how people respond to it is all.</p>

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s another clarification question, but as I fear I will not be able to last the four months I initially planned to wait before asking for Permission, I&#39;d like to understand things as clearly as I can. (On a side note, my eyeballs are sore from reading so much...)<br><br>So I know non-mission stories about our agents are fine - and look to be just as entertaining to write as missions - but I see on the wiki that it&#39;s &quot;recommend[ed that I] write a few missions first.&quot;<br><br>Which is completely understandable. Better to practice the harder stuff before you rest for a while on your laurels. I was just wondering if I could introduce my first agent pair - I&#39;m fairly certain I know who they will be - to the readers and to each other by means of a prelude story. You know, something like, &#39;Okay, we&#39;ve just wandered into HQ, gone through all the training, been assigned, great, but why is -she- my partner?&#39; It wouldn&#39;t be long (probably) but I thought it might be a fun way to introduce the two all around.<br><br>Any thoughts or pointers?</p>

            <p>One reason for that recommendation is that, well, we&#39;re here to read about PPC Agents: fitting someone into that slot without writing missions about them is a tricky thing to do. I&#39;ve actually got several stories with no missions in them - and heaps of characters who&#39;ve never had documented missions - but that&#39;s because I&#39;m very clever (or something like that). The &#39;Wandering around HQ lookin&#39; at the stuff&#39; type of story has been done a lot (usually as interludes), and you need something special to make it work - which, again, usually means your agents go on missions beforehand.<br><br>That said, a prelude with their meetup is a common thing to do (<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">my page</a> is full of them - Narto and Lou have one, and Dafydd and Selene used to have two!) - and from what I&#39;ve seen, it often serves as a Permission writing sample. It lets people (PGs, really) see your agents, your writing style, and your understanding of the PPC all in one swell foop - and, as you say, it introduces them for readers of your entire catalogue, too.<br><br>But be careful. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m your partner, and we have IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES which oh, hey, you like the same music as me and we are now chums forever&quot; has been done a lot (going back to Agent Jay Thorntree, actually), and while most people won&#39;t remember them all, it&#39;s always best to create something unique...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Probably the best way to do tropes is to try not to let them influence you one way or the other, and just make absolutely certain to keep a firm grip on the logic of your universe. For example, if you can think of reasons why a katana would be impractical, (Such as, most people have guns, they&#39;ll just shoot you when you pull it on them, you can&#39;t take it through an airport, few people know how to use one properly, it can&#39;t be concealed) then don&#39;t use katanas in that setting. It can still be funny, if, say, despite all that, someone <i>does</i> use a katana well, if someone delivers a funny lecture on why they&#39;re impractical, or if someone who swears by them gets shot by the practical gunman instead. </p>

            <p>Now there&#39;s an idea.<br><br>Actually, in my comedy story (read: blatant ignoring of all probabilities and physical capabilities for the sake of humor while blaming it all on a wormhole or something) about a space-faring band of mercenaries, one of the smarter crew members is a Guinea pig testing a prototype lightsaber/katana hybrid out. Its downside is that due to an enormous energy draw to keep the magnetically-charged laser blade stabilized, it overheats within a matter of five hours, and its battery only holds charge for about a day.<br><br>So, in a sense, I&#39;m kind of already employing this option - just in the most outlandish method possible.<br><br>Good advice!</p>

            <p>They shouldn&#39;t dictate your writing style. As you said in your post, you decided to defy &quot;Katanas Are Just Awesome&quot; by <s>nerfing</s> significantly downplaying the efficiency of this weapon.<br><br>The question you have to ask yourself is: is this really necessary? Katanas are very sturdy and reliable weapons in real life, so there is really no need to exaggerate their weaknesses. The weapon just needs to have a plausible explanation to be in the story, that&#39;s all.<br><br>The same concept should apply to whatever you&#39;re writing. You should be able to write a logical, solid plot with convincing and relatable characters without worrying about tripping over overused tropes. Do not think in terms of defying tropes, because it&#39;s painfully obvious to the reader when you do so. <br><br>I suggest you have a look at <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools"> Tropes Are Tools</a>. I found it to be quite helpful.<br><br>Besides, the only reason katanas are so cool is that they&#39;re Japanese and that their blade is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fnp91gg1j0"> curved</a>. </p>

            <p>... such as, for instance, me... they tend to break down into a few types.<br><br>-Broadswords. Big, clumsy things used for hacking strokes by men in heavy armour.<br>--Laser swords &amp; lightsabers. Used the same as the above, only substituting robes for armour.<br>-Fencing swords. Pointy, wiggly things with no blade and no chance of hurting anyone.<br>-Scimitars. Hulking great curved swords (often with a notch out of them!) used by people in turbans.<br>-Katanas. Sleek, elegant things that can take a man&#39;s arms off before he gets his broadsword unsheathed.<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s a bit of an exaggerated simplification, but it&#39;s pretty much the popular view.<br><br>Personal note: I would make the following changes to the above list:<br>-Fencing swords may include some with actual blades, which are basically western katanas.<br>-The Roman-style gladius stabbing sword is a distinct prospect from the broadsword.<br>-It is possible to move a broadsword (using the term horribly incorrectly to cover everything) fast. :P<br><br>But that&#39;s because I read the wrong things (specifically a fencer&#39;s LJ, various Roman-era books, and Michael Crichton&#39;s <i>Timeline</i>). I would, however, look things up before writing them... which many wouldn&#39;t bother.<br><br>So. Katanas are cool because they&#39;re elegant, pretty much.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Also, modern sport fencing foils do hurt, especially when you&#39;re me and decide to take up fencing in college with no idea of anything besides pointing the tip at the target and keeping your feet in the right place. I used to get tiny eraser-sized bruises all over my body, and epee will give you some nasty welts. This, and many more reasons, are why I no longer fence. I&#39;m a wuss. <br><br>The rest of your list made me laugh.

            <p>Fencing and kendo are rough if you go in completely unaware. I don&#39;t practice either, but I know what they&#39;re like.<br><br>And with Skyrim hot on Japan&#39;s tail in terms of popularity, you can imagine a lot of the swords in that game are considered pretty near as well.<br><br>I admit, I am part of this bandwagon - Travels of a Wandering Adventurer uses weaponry and settings similar to Skyrim&#39;s way of doing things.<br><br>On a side note, you know what&#39;s fun?

            <p>Yeah, that&#39;s about the size of it, huh?<br><br>It really kind of makes sword nuts, like me, agitated to learn that people just can not find it in themselves to stop and truly appreciate the blade as it should be.<br><br>But, them&#39;s the breaks.<br><br>If you want my rendition of a similar list, it goes a bit like:<br><br>1.

Katanas, sabers, and the like were your standard warswords for officers or well-attuned fighters who didn&#39;t need two edges on their blade, or were horsemen who needed a weapon for lopping heads off on the saddle<br><br>3. Daiklaves, Zweihanders, Claymores, Dai-katanas and the like were swords for heavier infantry, meant to tear through baddies by substituting speed for weight + inertia that ended up being nigh-unstoppable when you got going.<br><br>As I&#39;m not the most studied in blades myself, despite my nuttiness, this list is understandably flawed.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m trying to destroy the quality and truth behind the tropes - I&#39;m just trying to write them in a realistic manner is all.<br><br>But I understand what you mean. I still have a character (so far) that prefers a katana over other weaponry, and is quite fluent with it.<br><br>Another hard point for me is always managing cast members. My ongoing blog story, Travels of a Wandering Adventurer, follows the life of young Ethan Brynn and the friends he meets along the way, but already I&#39;m starting to see several Sue traits coming out in the characters of Ethan, Kraig Lescarr, and the aged Samuel Brynn. Since there are so many characters that I will be focusing on in the future, how do I prevent from the cast becoming an army of Sues by mistake?</p>

            <p>I think the authors have a good idea - I certainly found a lot of it very funny - but they don&#39;t seem to really grasp what makes a Mary-Sue a Mary-Sue, or a Mary-Sue Hunter a Mary-Sue Hunter.  Several of the &quot;Mary-Sues&quot; get a decent enough characterization that I actually sort of start to like them, while the Mary-Sue Hunters are mostly portrayed as men (There is canonically <i>one</i> female Mary-Sue Hunter, and she&#39;s an ex-Sue who mainly wants revenge for being bullied at the Mary-Sue Academy) who don&#39;t like other people having fun and kill Sues just for the sake of killing Sues.  They&#39;re not <i>really</i> out to protect Canon, they just... hate Sues.  (And they can very easily be won over by Sue seduction.  Like, immediately.)<br><br>Only one Sue-Hunter (their leader and founder, though) is of the Just Hates Women type, as far as I can tell, but honestly, most of the Sues are better-characterized than the Sue-Hunters.<br><br>I can&#39;t tell whether the authors are making fun of overly-dramatic Mary-Sues, playing the devil&#39;s advocate just for the challenge, or genuinely believe that Mary-Sues are a good (or at least cool and fun) thing.  Either way, though, the Mary-Sue Hunters are, for the most part, presented in a really unflattering way.  The whole comic is, while funny, sort of uncomfortable after a while, because I keep wondering, <i>is this really how people see Mary-Sues and the people who hate them?</i></p>

            <p>... eg <a href="http://www.drunkduck.com/Mary_Sue_Academy/5166123/">here</a>, it seems that the author thinks &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; is a synonym for &#39;OFC&#39;... or &#39;fanon version of female canon&#39;.

            <p>I agree - after about the third page, I found myself wondering if this is what Mary Sue-haters look like to the rest of the community.<br><br>And then I remembered how I <i>used</i> to react to Twilight-bashing - how I used to look at anyone who went about trumpeting their &#39;anti-Twilight propaganda,&#39; which usually included pointing out the Sue-ishness of the whole thing - and (while I am now able to laugh at what is becoming less and less of a fandom for me), I find the answer to be yes...conditionally.<br><br>Since most of my old run-ins with anti-Twihards were on deviantART - and I&#39;ve discovered that this is the comic&#39;s place of origin - I can&#39;t help but wonder if maybe some of the characterization for the Mary Sue Hunters comes from the comments, pictures, and forum posts made by deviants (members of the site, not rogue PPCers or anything like that). If you look, a lot of them - though not necessarily a majority - are less &quot;why Sues are unhealthy for canon&quot; and &quot;how to avoid creating a Sue,&quot; and more &quot;OH MY GLOD WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING SO STUPID YOU FAIL AT WRITING FOREVER!&quot;<br><br>So, maybe the authors have only ever encountered the out-of-control Sue-haters who are fire and brimstone and BLARGH YOU SHOULDN&#39;T BE ALLOWED TO WRITE. Maybe they don&#39;t even know the PPC <i>exists</i>, and think that all Sue-haters are psychotic and don&#39;t actually base their Sue-hate on anything logical, like canon breaking or character defiling.<br><br>Or...maybe it&#39;s just meant to be silly all around.

            <p>Some of the recent events have got me a bit worried, so... how many Permission Givers are currently/still actually around? I know I am, but... anyone else?

            <p>This has come up before - usually right when the balance between People Waiting For Permission and People Tired of Answering All The Requests hits critical mass (though fortunately, not this time, I think). It&#39;s not a bad idea to call roll and figure out where we are <i>before</i> we reach Torch-and-Pitchfork status, and props to hS for doing so.<br><br>The main two reasons I am a fan of more PGs rather than fewer are fairly simple. First, selfishly, less stress on the PGs- shared burdens are halved and so on, and it just means less of a workload per person in general. Second, on an entirely different front, diffusion of power. Yes, I&#39;m paranoid. But the more different, trustworthy people we have filling the position, the less likely we are to ever wind up with a monolith.<br><br>--VM, who tried to post this three times from various devices last night.

            <p>With the emphasis on &#39;different&#39;. I know I have a distressing tendency to view the PGs as a government-of-sorts (even though we have no actual power, a couple of PGs suggesting something tends to get it taken very seriously), and sometimes I even start viewing it in terms of party politics... but that&#39;s wrong, and thank you for saying something which helped me remember that. PGs, like any other people, will agree and disagree on things at various times - but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a conspiracy to promote The One True Way. If several of us are promoting something (say, free cookies for all!), that just means several of us approve of something.<br><br>And yeah, that goes for the PPC as a whole, too. And any other group you care to name... but yes. Diversity in PGs - outside the core responsibilities - is very important.<br><br>(All that said, I still firmly believe Kaitlyn should be one - but I may be a little biased there :P)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The problem is, a fair number of us aren&#39;t all that active (including, most of the time, me), and there is, among those laughingly called &#39;humanity&#39;, a common tendency to say &#39;Oh, someone else will deal with it&#39;.

            <p>I have some interesting feelings about Johnlock. I mean, I love most of the fics I&#39;ve read with it, and when it&#39;s done right I adore it. At the same time I have a hard time not reading Sherlock as asexual, but not necessarily aromantic. And John has a huge man-crush on him.

            <p>Because just because someone is asexual doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t somehow find a soul mate. And because soul mate does not necessarily equal sex, sexual attraction, or any of that stuff. Yet, it seems that 90% of people who write fanfiction are unaware of the fact that there <i>can</i> be any sort of close relationships besides sexual ones, and ignore the romantic aspect entirely. <br><br>As an asexual I do have some pretty strong feelings about this, in case you couldn&#39;t tell. (Though, I&#39;m not 100% certain that BBC Sherlock is asexual: he&#39;s usually very observant of when other people are in relationships, when that information seems useful to him, and he certainly <i>notices</i> Irene, though throughout that episode their interactions did read kind of oddly. Personally, I once got lost in my school gym because all the other girls had stopped to watch the guys play basketball with no shirts, which I hadn&#39;t even noticed was going on. I had to go back and find them and ask them why they&#39;d stopped, but I suppose  I can&#39;t be a completely representative sample for every Asexual.)<br><br>Seriously, though, that&#39;s why I love BBC Sherlock so much. The Sherlock/John relationship is, human heads in the freezer aside, pretty much an ideal slightly romantic friendship. And next season needs to get here <i>now</i> before I annoy the heck out of my friends going over last season with them. </p>

            <p>Oh dear <i>Eru</i>, there are so many things wrong with just the first chapter, let alone the rest of the story. I&#39;d personally say that Sherlock&#39;s character is mangled beyond recognition in the first chapter alone, given his canonical distrust of people that aren&#39;t well known to him being in his flat; I highly highly doubt he&#39;d just give a key to his flat to some random girl who just so happens to related to John. <br><br>So, we&#39;re obviously dealing with a Replacement!Sherlock, and probably a Replacement!John and Replacement!Lestrade as well. Hmm... I&#39;ll think about it, but I&#39;m not claiming this fic at the moment.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed reading this. I also found the swear jar funny, although I felt that it was kind of abandoned during the second half of the fic. I was disappointed that there was no Buffy the Vampire Slayer, despite it being in the list of canons. Although, I suppose the fact that the sue was killed before she got to BtVS is a good thing.</p>

            <p>...but she&#39;s not quite free of it yet. (In her previous missions she was dropping a LOT of F-bombs, so this was an in-story way for me to tone that down.) And the BtVS was in the previous fic with the same &#39;Sue, who made reference to her time in Sunnydale during this fic. This one was more egregious, but I think that one was just worse (counting the quality of the writing). The &quot;buffy the vampire slayer&quot; tag on her journal should link to it.</p>

            <p>((  I&#39;m not familiar with your spinnoff, so I might have missed some context on the jokes. ))<br><br>There was a lot of funny things in your mission. Kitty&#39;s attempts to avoid triggering the swear jar, especially in situations where profanity is generally used, were definitely chuckle-worthy. I really liked the agents&#39; banter (and their opposing personalities). The execution method was also very much in the PPC spirit. Stabby and shooty things are all well and good, but sometimes you have to do something funny like drowning the Sue in ice cream that your partner&#39;s been telling you to put down for half the mission. <br><br>The post-mission scene, especially the &quot;kill people and get drinks&quot; line, was also funny because of the contrast between the violent (though friendly) banter and the happy, &quot;they&#39;re reconciling&quot; ending. <br><br>I did catch one thing that <i>might</i> be a typo, though. In:<br><blockquote>Then tell me, o glorious arbiter of all things invective-y,</blockquote> I <i>think</i> that &quot;o&quot; should be &quot;O&quot;.</p>

            <p>Some random thoughts have been going around my head, inspired by an old thread I ran across somehow, and this seemed to be as good a place as any for them. So, here goes.<br><br>We&#39;re a writing community. What&#39;s more, we&#39;re dedicated to <i>good</i> writing. You generally can&#39;t improve your writing if people don&#39;t tell you what they think about it. If no one leaves any reviews, you don&#39;t know what other people thought was funny, boring, lame, cool, et cetera. Without that information, you can&#39;t make your next mission better. <br><br>I&#39;ve been here for about a year and a half, and I&#39;ve seen many (not most, but many) mission threads pass off the front page without substantial comments from anyone. That&#39;s not good. I think we, the PPC, should make an effort to review each other&#39;s missions more. The reviews don&#39;t have to be long — a few sentences generally suffices. I realize that many people are busy and don&#39;t have time to review while the mission is on the front page. In that case, I propose replying with something along the lines of &quot;Will review later. Real life&#39;s in the way.&quot; and then actually reading and reviewing later when one has the time, even if the mission thread has dropped off the front page. Of course, if the mission is somewhere that supports comments, delayed reviews could be put there instead.<br><br>I&#39;m not proposing that everyone review or comment on every mission, just that we make an effort to help each other improve. </p>

            <p>That&#39;s a good point, but from the missions I&#39;ve read - which, admittedly, is only around...maybe 35, counting the Original Series? - it looks like the missions are mostly posted on sites where people can leave comments on the mission post(s). And on these such pages, it does appear that people are leaving scattered bits of advice - a capitalization pointer here, a SPaG note there.<br><br>That said, some people post on sites where that isn&#39;t possible (Jay and Acacia certainly did!) I think those ones should definitely still get some concrit, either on the Board or...eh, wherever the author(s) can read it.</p>

            <p>The author&#39;s talk page on the wiki is probably a good place to post concrit, if the author was around after the wiki was created. If you can somehow search up the Board post where the mission was first posted, you might be able to post there, even though that means <b>only</b> the author will see the corcrit. You could also try emailing the author (same drawbacks). If those methods don&#39;t work or you don&#39;t want to use them, posting to the Board seems like a good idea. In fact, I&#39;m reminded of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2514;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">Nesh started last March</a>, though that didn&#39;t get much traction.</p>

            <p>Welcome a-Board! As the local twin in this neck of the internet I feel I should warn you that evil twins are not always that blatant. Your twin may have made a clone of his or her self as backup in case of sudden homicide and may currently be biding their time until the moment they can ruin your life. Or they might be like mine and just copy 90% of what you do. It&#39;s dependent on whether they&#39;re identical or fraternal. Also, *voice drops to a whisper* don&#39;t make any sudden movements. She could be anyone.<br><br>*Straightens up* Well then, now that&#39;s out of the way I would like to present you with your newbie gift. It&#39;s a Reality Simulator* for when you&#39;re stuck in a virtual world of monsters and murders and you need a good dose of the mundane. Enjoy!<br><br>*Reality Simulator is a generalized simulation and cannot fabricate real people. Any relation to real people found in the Reality Simulator is entirely coincidental, unless of course they are the real people we have kidnapped in order to simulate an actual reality which we have never experienced, we being robots from the 8th dimension.
