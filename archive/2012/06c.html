            <p>Greetings, <br><br>My name is Alex and I have just went through the massive walls of text that I found in the Wiki... Gosh, there sure are a lot of rules in regards to the PPC community aren&#39;t there?<br><br>My goal at first was to perhaps join the agents and eventually partake in missions, but right now I am still a little hazy about the whole process and honestly reading the original PPCs from first to last (yes, even the dark elf) proved to be a task so arduous I feel I should take a break from the entire setting for a little bit. <br><br>All that said and done, I thought introducing myself should be done. After all, there&#39;s an estimated month-long period before anything can actually get done right? So I hoped that this would help get that over with... <br><br>I probably messed up somehow in this whole introductory business and my brain is little save for a puddle of lethargic goo right now, so I&#39;d love it if some of you could point me in the proper directions while I&#39;m still shiny. </p>

            <p>Thanks, I always wanted to have something constituting of a physically impossible color... Does this mean I get to use a light-saber canonically?

            <p>Don&#39;t be daunted, those walls-o-text are only there to make sure that nothing gets out of hand and so that everyone can enjoy this board. In fact, it&#39;s great that you even read it. Some newbies seem to miss it entirely. Anyway, since you said that you like anime, I now present you with a pair of 2-D glasses.

So, rather than &quot;getting that over with,&quot; you should just focus on getting to know folks here!  Get in conversations, play in RPs (like the one below, for example) and just generally hang out!  We do a whole lot more than just look at badfics!<br><br>The Original Series?  Arduous?  Not the word I would have used.  I hope you still enjoyed them!  (They are kind of important for us.  After all, we&#39;re technically writing fan fiction of the world Jay and Acacia created!)<br><br>So!  Good to have you a-Board!  Welcome to the PPC!</p>

            <p>I was so focused on doing this right I completely forgot mentioning the basics. ^^&#39;<br><br>I&#39;m a fan of Star Wars/Trek/Gate (I know that grouping them like this will make some fan-boys shudder, I AM doing it to tease you guys), a vast number of anime series, LOTR and many many things. I&#39;m also a huge fan of fan-bases in general, so if you ask me if I ever heard about (insert series here) you can be sure that if the answer is no I will have researched it and watched a good dose of its material by the next day. For the sake of making this easier to remember; assume I know about everything.<br><br>I have dwelled in fan-fic and have also occasionally role-played in series-based universes, I have no particular preferences when it comes to the fan-fics I read, as if someone writes well enough I could even enjoy a story involving the disco-ball vampires of Twilight.<br><br>I currently study in psychology and while I am generally a well-behaved person I think I am legally obligated to tell everyone present I anger easily. This is supposed to be a friendly board however, and I take constructive criticism very well, so unless you&#39;re actively seeking trouble this should not be an issue.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC oh lethargic goo brained one. I&#39;m guessing from your complaints you&#39;ve already read the Constitution and found the wiki, so we can skip those formalities. We are re-establishing the Big Sib/Little Sib program, so please tell us about yourself and we can place you in a house or something. For example, what are your fandoms?<br><br>Also, we seem  to be in the middle of a water war at the moment so for your present I&#39;ll give you a water balloon. It&#39;s filled with urple paint. Feel free to join the fun and throw at anyone but me.</p>

            <p>I corrected myself by adding in my fandoms just as you replied, its amusing to see how things like that work...<br><br>Ah yes, I saw that program in the wiki... Big Sibling / Little Sibling sounds like a very good way to make everything seem more welcoming, I&#39;m glad it was re-instated.<br><br>Well, since I have your permission to jump in I will make good use of your gift TO (if you will in turn allow me to shorten your name in such a way).<br><br>Thank you for your welcoming attitude as it is most welcome...

            <p>Now, I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t go around actively searching for badfic, but the title still applies.<br><br>It&#39;s Phineas and Ferb... supposedly. Or should I say PHENIAS AND FERN. Or maybe penas and fren. Anyway, from what I can gather, Phineas and Ferb recreate Evangelion and it leads to a full-scale robot war. Isabella dies, Phineas IMMEDIATELY bursts into an angsty song about it, and there&#39;s a highly implausible climactic battle. Oh, and established characters from the show become death magnets (and are almost never spelled right).<br><br>Hopefully a troll.

            <p>-sob- I just finished reading the Bionicle fanfic currently on the Unclaimed Badfic page (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2681339/1/A_new_world">A new world</a>, capitalization theirs entirely) through sheer force of will, a lot of snarky comments, and promises of Sue-death in a Notepad document interspersed between a rudimentary charge list. I had Googled the Sue&#39;s name at one point because I hadn&#39;t seen the author&#39;s username then and found the author&#39;s ff.net profile via that Google. Three fanfics: my eventual prey, and the... things... I&#39;m presenting now.<br><br><b>Thing one:</b><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2429975/1/New_Team_Member">New Team Member</a>, a Stargate SG-1 fanfic set at the beginning of season 2 according to the author.<br>Quoth the summary:<br><i>A young girl enters the SGC claiming to be from the species who built the Stargates.</i><br><br>Fifteen year old girl described as having perfect white skin. The prose is less beige than the Bionicle thing... but not by much. At all. According to the summary she&#39;s an Ancient, and I&#39;m side-eying her already just from that and her perfect skin. Also she&#39;s in Pompeii and had moved there <i>&#39;a few days ago before the volcano had erupted&#39;</i>, quoth the fic. Has a probably-a-jumper-but-too-vague-to-be-sure. Goes to the SGC, OOCs everyone into just taking her to the Stargate instead of pointing guns at this nut. 1,324 words over two chapters and a chapter/author&#39;s-note. Author&#39;s abandoned it.<br><br>Charges, you ask? This Sophie&#39;s a Mary Sue, of course. Being described as perfect. Causing beige prose. Causing Glodforsaken abuse of the English language: to whit, dialogue by a new speaker not being put on a new line and other wanton cruelty to the common nearly everything punctuation related. Having ill-described and seemingly omniscient tech: to whit, that ship of hers, which showed her <i>&#39;all the history I&#39;ve missed since I was asleep&#39;</i> and also told her about the SGC and made her modern clothing. Going to Cheyenne Mountain and asking about the Stargate and not getting looked at horrifically suspiciously. More abuse of the English language: to whit, your/you&#39;re confusion, put into the mouth of <i>Daniel ******* Jackson of all people</i> er um yes where was I. Being an Ancient without good reason for being on Earth and in a body. Causing godawful sudden shifts in the story&#39;s current location in space-time without even a horizontal rule to warn us, though it is on fanfiction.net so it could be that the site ate those. Causing OOC in the form of blithe introductions to main cast members with only token suspicion from Jack O&#39;Neill and I&#39;m pretty sure that was only put in so he could have seen the error of his ways though, again, abandoned. Causing mental injury to an Intelligence agent: to whit, ME. Ow.<br><br><br><b>Thing Two:</b><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5642523/1/AllSpark_Reborn">AllSpark Reborn</a>, a Transformers fanfic.<br>Quoth the summary:<br><i>The Decepticons kidnap Sam and Mikaela&#39;s baby until eighteen years later...</i><br><br>I don&#39;t know much about Transformers, but this is certainly confusing with what I do know. Why do the Decepticons care about a little sprog? What is even going on in the second chapter? Oh right, beige fog of DOOM. I have nigh-on no idea what&#39;s going on but it smells like badfic. The dialogue is at least readable due to proper conventions being followed, but the prose is bland as the other two and seriously, seriously what is even. But there&#39;s this one Transformer that the Sue is friends with or something who was pretending to be a Decepticon but then took off a disguise creator and his coloring changed and he had an Autobot logo... yeah I give up I&#39;ll just put this in the capable hands of someone who knows the fandom, it is utterly incomprehensible to me.</p>

            <p>But I&#39;ve been looking at the author&#39;s page on FF.net, and... I don&#39;t know what to think. I enjoy My Immortal because it&#39;s a) so ridiculously biased and niche that I can laugh at it, and b) it could be a troll, but it could be real, and that adds mystery and also humour. I enjoy the works of Sue Mary because she&#39;s a) so ridiculously over-the-top that it&#39;s hilarious, and b) obviously a troll, but quite possibly doing it to mock other trolls, which makes it a million times more enjoyable. The guy behind THIS (dave-carpenter123) seems, if he&#39;s a troll, to be aiming for the best of both worlds, and hitting all over the place. The other interesting thing about him is that he&#39;s produced nine fanfics so far, all of them dated June 21st. Nine in one day. ONE DAY. None of them are good (at all), but none of them are particularily funny, either (with the possible exception of his Tom and Jerry fic - my reaction was essentially &quot;That&#39;s it?!&quot;) Truly, this is a remarkable human being. Maybe. I&#39;m probably about to be alerted to a dozen authors just like him, but in my mind, he&#39;s an impressive troll. Unless, of course, he isn&#39;t a troll at all, in which case all bets are off.</p>

            <p>Hi! I have been awkwardly stalking the PPC since I was a lil sprog just barely hitting double digits, but it is only today that I will be given a na -- whoops, my Homestuck is showing -- but it is only today that I will be introducing myself!<br><br>Anywave. On the PPC side of things I&#39;ve read Jay and Acacia&#39;s original series a gazillion times, can&#39;t recite the Constitution but I&#39;ve read it at least a couple times, and what I don&#39;t know off the top of my head I can probably search for on the Wiki.<br><br>On the fannish side, as I think of the various and sundry things I&#39;ve dabbled in... -takes deep breath-<br><br>Bionicle (half my life. I&#39;m 16 and I&#39;ve been in this fandom HALF MY LIFE. Oh and Worf is God. Er. Michael Dorn voices one. Someone who&#39;s sort of a god. He saved the end of Bionicle from being a totally worthless wreck with his voice alone and that&#39;s what matters.)<br><br>Harry Potter (:C Hufflepuff gets no love. I&#39;m a Gryffindor but GO BADGERS GO!)<br><br>Runescape (Half my life...?! Lore fiend and also SO -EXCIT-ED for the combat overhaul, I can&#39;t wait for the beta on the 26th~)<br><br>Stargate (Daniel!! er. you did not hear me squee.)<br><br>Star Wars (VWOOM VWOOM VWOOM VWOOM just in it for the lightsabers, also Darths &amp; Droids is hilarious)<br><br>Star Trek (sort of...? precious little canon seen but I am interested.)<br><br>Doctor Who (can&#39;t sleep angels will eat me -- but seriously, I think I hate Steven Moffat for creating those THINGS. How I managed to watch Flesh and Stone twice I&#39;ve no idea because even the idea of them freaks me out now.)<br><br>World of Warcraft (starter editon n00b but I have Opinions on Garrosh Hellscream, all of them &quot;I miss Thrall&quot;)<br><br>The Hunger Games (guys who thinks part of District 13&#39;s bargain with Panem was to create the Hunger Games? My mom thinks so, why can&#39;t I forget she said that)<br><br>Avatar: The Last Airbender (this also includes LOK, and though I&#39;ve only seen the first 2 episodes so far I REALLY LIKE KORRA)<br><br>Homestuck (I will pick through Equius&#39;s appearances to look for things about him that aren&#39;t solely creepy sweaty hemocastist douche, I kinda feel obligated since he&#39;s my patron troll and all)<br><br>Hero Factory (but only because I have headcanon connecting it and Bionicle. Depressing headcanon involving all my favorite characters dying and their species dying out with them and Akiyama Makuro being the only remaining direct creation of the Matoran and only one who remembers them -- goddammit I really need to WRITE this thing already -- but I&#39;ll take that over similar and out of universe definitely related but totally not connected in the story.)<br><br>Young Wizards (Third place seniority after Bionicle and Runescape, first real fannish interaction. Went for the first book because yes, yes I do want to be a wizard. I have alllll the books. Except A Wizard Abroad, I think. :C)<br><br>Lord of the Rings (okay seriously how did this one take this long. I saw all three of the LotR movies on three consecutive birthdays. I plan to see the Hobbit movies on two consecutive birthdays. THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY FANDOM. oh yes and I&#39;ve read it too. I even have the Silmarillion somewhere.)<br><br>The Inheritance Cycle (Only here because I have Ideas for AUs. And I like Murtagh. And Nasuada, I like Nasuada. And combinations of the two... okay so the last book may have given me a new ship for my armada.)<br><br>Twilight (Because Luminosity, and Reasoning With Vampires.)<br><br>Tamora Pierce&#39;s stuff (I have all four Immortals books. Or I did, I have no idea where Wolf-speaker is. :C Weh.)<br><br>Artemis Fowl (/Holly Short oops my ships are showing. Got a few of those, haven&#39;t really been in this lately but I have The Atlantis Complex on a shelf nearby and it reminded me I like this criminal mastermind.)<br><br>Marvel stuff (Runaways, Runaways I think I&#39;ve actually read all of because the library had it. Also a little Spiderman.)<br><br>DC stuff (Green Lantern. Ish. I want to get into this but I have naught but pocket lint.)<br><br>Comic book stuff in general (Or do they call &#39;em graphic novels now... whatever. THOSE THINGS. I want to, I do, but pocket lint buys very little and the library kinda sucks for this sort of thing so I&#39;m stuck watching AT4W and pining.)<br><br>Firefly (-sob- WASH -sniffle-)<br><br>Neopets (I could only be a worse mother if I didn&#39;t check my Neopets back into Cockroach Towers every 28 days, but on occasion I bother to mess around.)<br><br>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (SOOOO COOOOOOOOL)<br><br>Discworld (Somewhat...? Okay, I&#39;ve read Wintersmith, the Nac Mac Feegle are hilarious. I&#39;ve read a billion really, really funny things ABOUT Discworld, namely hedgehogs. I&#39;ve seen a couple recs for which books to read first. I haven&#39;t yet got off my ass and actually put in a hold for any of those so I can&#39;t bloody remember any of them. HALP!)<br><br>Diana. Wynne. Jones. (Tough Guide to Fantasyland especially.)<br><br>Narnia (I FORGET ABOUT ALL THE CLASSICS)<br><br>A Wrinkle in Time, et al. (Been so long since I read this but I love it still; I twitch whenever I think about Meg Murray getting something related to math wrong, though that&#39;s a wrong Authoress problem. And &quot;tesseract&quot; being used when &quot;wormhole&quot; would probably be more appropriate, but Madeline L&#39;Engle isn&#39;t a mathematician so... yeah no I can still grump.)<br><br>Huh. Wow. That&#39;s a lot more than I thought I had. I really only dabble in a few at a time, though. Homestuck is my main Thing right now, I think my AO3 reading history is 95% Homestuck fanfic. I guess one could say Bionicle is my primary fandom for having posted stuff in, but there&#39;s only one gorram data point and it&#39;s a Bionicle fanfic of COURSE it&#39;s my main fandom if you go by what I&#39;ve posted.<br><br>I like headcanoning, and filling in plot holes, and worldbuilding. When writing I have an unfortunate habit of insisting on making everything perfect, which gets really annoying when I&#39;m just trying to get an idea down on paper. Or binary. Mostly I type, really. I also draw, the human figure pretty much exclusively, learned through trial, error, and using siblings as grudging models. I&#39;m good enough that I can sketch out a character design and have it look more or less like what I meant, in an anatomically accurate but simplified style. Except hands. I hate hands, they&#39;re fiddly and have too many moving parts that splay all over everywhere.<br><br>I am, as is likely very obvious by now, verbose. Well, either I&#39;m verbose or I&#39;m hiding in a corner doing a fair imitation of Fluttershy, one of the two states. Clearly this isn&#39;t the Fluttershy one. I suspect I&#39;m making up for lost time or something. I also tend to fall into a somewhat formal pattern of speech when not writing at top speed and while somewhat nervous... like... right now, for instance. Blah. Blaaaaah.<br><br>Okay seriously this is getting ridiculous, <a href="http://www.wordcounttool.com/"><a href="http://www.wordcounttool.com/">http://www.wordcounttool.com/</a></a> says it&#39;s 1413 words long.<br><br>I am introducing myself. I write a lot and draw some. I would like to integrate myself into this very entertaining group of people instead of lurking in the shadows. I would like to work towards being known enough to get Permission so I can put the fear of the Great Beings into that unclaimed Bionicle badfic instead of just pining after doing so. I have a massive number of fandoms that have various and shifting claims on portions of my soul and the list above is almost definitely incomplete. I am a science geek and a mathematician and I will learn everything ever purely to make my writing accurate. I love building worlds and making things make sense, and if I care enough about a plot-hole-riddled work -coughBioniclecough- I will go out of my way to try to fill those plot holes. I am neither a flower nor the color of one, but you may call me either, and I get you mean me more quickly if you use the spelling with an e, which isn&#39;t a misspelling but don&#39;t ask me beyond that because I was EIGHT when I named my Runescape character Lielac.<br><br>Okay, I&#39;m done. -puts away the paint and pets the newly dark cyan doe-</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Board!  Have some chocolate, won&#39;t you? That&#39;s a long intro you got there, lemme see if I can put my two cents in...<br><br>Bionicle- Oh WOW do I miss this series! My favorite arcs were the original... and the Hordika arc... the latter for my own reasons. (And yes, Michael Dorn has a great voice, doesn&#39;t he?)<br><br>Hero Factory- It&#39;s okay... but not as good as Bionicle, in my opinion. Though I did buy the bad guy toys, mainly because I thought they looked cooler than the hero ones...)<br><br>Harry Potter/Young Wizards/Discworld/Lord of the Rings/Chronicles of Narnia/Artemis Fowl- Good books, &#39;nuff said.<br><br>Star Wars/Star Trek/Doctor Who/Firefly- Good shows/films... even if they have their flaws (I still can&#39;t forgive Joss Wheadon for what he did to some of my favorite characters...)<br><br>Twilight/Eragon- I think what bugs me the most about these books is that they COULD have been good, but as they are, they&#39;re just... Meh.<br><br>Marvel/DC and comics in general- I love comics, even if I&#39;m indifferent to the recent Marvel and DC titles... (also, AT4W for the win!)<br><br>Homestuck- I like the series... but it&#39;s so long that I prefer to read/watch the comic in short bursts.<br><br>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic- What else is there to say, but great show (crazy fans not withstanding)?<br><br>Avatar: The Last Airbender/Legend of Korra- Loved the first series, haven&#39;t watched much of the second (I should really get on that...)<br><br>Neopets- I like the concepts they have, though the guilt-causing measure it implements is a real pain...<br><br>Anyway, you have some good taste in fandoms, I hope to see you around more!</p>

            <p>Ooh, chocolate! I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s dark chocolate, I love dark chocolate. But not the stuff that&#39;s got sugar instead of milk, that causes acute nausea.<br><br>Bionicle - aaaaah, me tooooo. I think my favorite has and always will be 2001-2003, though I like certain elements of 2009 such as <s>Worf&#39;s voice</s>Mata Nui and Kiina. And the pair of them. Also Berix&amp;Kiina strained sibling relationship, I have a whole complicated head canon for that with one story actually posted and another forming to get the explanatory backstory down. Mostly I do AUs at this point, though; I have one WIP where the Matoran who would have become the Chronicler&#39;s Company became Toa with the Toa Metru&#39;s Toa stones instead of Takua using the stones to summon the Toa Mata...<br><br>Hero Factory - Agreed on Bionicle being better. I have Stormer, Breez, and Surge (all 2.0) on my desk, and my sibs have a couple of villain sets. Von Nebula and Fire Lord, I think. I mostly got into this due to my sudden urge to write that story connecting it and Bionicle.<br><br>Dem 6 different books what are fantasy - Aye. I&#39;m currently about two-thirds through <i>Soul Music</i>.<br><br>Dem 4 sci-fi vidya things - Ooh, speaking of Joss I&#39;ve been sort of half-heartedly trying to get into Buffy and I really need to watch Dr. Horrible&#39;s Sing-Along Blog before I spoil myself completely.<br><br>Dem bricks - Edward is a stalky creepy person and Bella is too stupidly romantic to be likable, in my opinion. I actually liked <i>Eragon</i> the book, but I can&#39;t remember if I even finished reading <i>Eldest</i> and have vague recollections of frustration and throwing with great force that were probably due to Murtagh being forced into Galbatorix&#39;s service. I liked <i>Inheritance</i> only because Murtagh freed himself, but I hate Eragon and his actions (-ahem- MERCY, DRAGONRIDER) to pieces.<br><br>Comics - Whoo, AT4W! I did get a tip recently that a comic shop in town has cheap prices, so if/when I get money again I&#39;ll probably go down there and clean it out some, see what catches my eye.<br><br>Homestuck - I managed to read the whole thing over a few days in early October, then flailed around until [S] Cascade and rode the high from it and Intermission 2 to write 35,000 words in the first week of November.<br><br>MLP: FIM - Great show indeed. I&#39;m not so much in the fan part of the fandom so I&#39;ve missed personal interaction with crazies, and I think I might skip out on the Google search... hahahahahahahaha who am I kidding I&#39;ll do that eventually.<br><br>ATLA/LOK - ATLA was indeed awesome and I also need to continue in the LOK-watching. If nothing else I can kick myself into gear by reminding myself that I find Kiina and Korra so similar I sometimes say one&#39;s name when talking about the other and I should really see how similar they actually are...<br><br>Neopets - I have it set to sent me e-mail notifs whenever my pets check out of the NeoLodge, so I just go back every 28 days and toss &#39;em back in, occasionally refilling my bank via a trip to the games room.<br><br>Thank you, and I plan to be around more so your hopes will hopefully not be dashed!</p>

            <p>Yessss about everything you just said about <i>Luminosity</i>. Also, it actually explores the cool parts of the world that SMeyer created (and though I am not a fan of hers at all, I will give credit where credit is due, her world is pretty chill) and not just the bits of it that are whee, teenage angst!

            <p>That was easily the longest newbie intro I have ever read. Granted I haven&#39;t been here very long (A month or two, I think) but it very much surpassed the word count on mine and I thought mine was long. It&#39;s alright though &#39;cause now I don&#39;t have to ask you any questions like if you&#39;ve read the constitution or found the wiki. Looking at your list of fandoms, I see a lot that I&#39;ve read or heard about. I just watched my first episode of MLP when I was babysitting my neighbor&#39;s kid a couple days ago and I finally see why people are so obsessed. The characters seem really well developed. Also, as many people have said before, it&#39;s really worth it to read the rest of Discworld, even though there are a ton of books. I still haven&#39;t finished them all but my favorite so far is <i>Night Watch<i>. <br>Wow, your wordiness has rubbed off on me. I must be moving along now. As a gift, take this Generic Writing Tool, because it seems you would make good use of it. With a little imagination and some programming it can become any writing implement you like! I personally prefer the crayon option. </i></i></p>

            <p>Ah, the Pyros... Yes, I can see you fitting in well there when the time comes. Personally, I&#39;m more of a lightning person.

            <p>Lightning is awesome too. It&#39;s one of the official Elemental Powers in Bionicle and one of the three that are female <s>which would have been four if not for a freaking TYPO thanks a LOT gregf</s>. It&#39;s my favorite in terms of what the element actually does.<br><br>-googles- Ehe. Ehehehe. Ehehehehehehehehe excuse me I need to go steal something.<br><br>I&#39;m trying to decide between Floaters, DMS, and DoGA for my gradually coalescing agents. Floaters would keep my options open, but I think the best catharsis would be in killing godawful Sues so I&#39;d gravitate towards those so maybe DMS, but DoGA gets flamethrowers and Sun Crushers and Do Want...</p>

            <p>Would that &#39;something&#39; be a Sun Crusher, by any chance?<br><br>I think DoGA definitely has some fun potential. Besides, if you like hunting &#39;Sues they&#39;re bound to run into *some*. I can imagine one type of aberration you&#39;d be dealing with would be the kind created as a &#39;new, exotic homeland/planet&#39; for a Mary Sue to come from. Even other types are pretty likely to come with a Mary Sue attached to the same fic.</p>

            <p>Sun Crusher? What is this Sun Crusher you speak of? I know of no crushed suns...<br><br>Ay, yeah. The fic I have my eye on for after Permission has a whole noncanonical island and city underneath it to reduce to charred remnants, and it also has a Mary Sue who I would really like to throttle. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t want to limit myself to Mary Sues that have also brought uncanon places into being, I want to hit <i>all</i> the sparkly little monsters that catch my eye.

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Have some of my hydrophobic water to commemorate the event. Like trinitrotoluene, but better!<br><br>Discworld recommendations, eh? Well, for starters you should definitely pick up <i>Guards! Guards!</i> It&#39;s the first in the City Watch arc and gives you a good introduction to the <s>sprawling mess</s> glorious city that is Ankh-Morpork. <i>Night Watch</i> is my all-time favourite and features Vimes and young!Vetinari. <i>Feet of Clay</i> is also worth your time.<br><br>Pottermore placed you in Gryffindor? I was placed in Hufflepuff, that house with the most members and the lowest number of House Points. Not that I care really: ironically enough, it actually echoes canon...<br><br>Inheritance Cycle? I&#39;ve read that and actually enjoy the over-the-top-ness and overall idiocy of the protagonist and Roran. Have you ever read Kippur&#39;s sporkings of the books? They&#39;re absolutely hilarious and make you see the novels in a new light. I can toss you a link if you want.<br><br>I see we got another MLP fan! You&#39;ll fit right in: we&#39;ve got a lot of those on the Board, myself included. Who&#39;s your favourite character(s)?</p>

            <p>Er. Is this stuff dangerous? It is &#39;TNT only better&#39;, according to you, and TNT <i>explodes</i>.<br><br>I put <i>Guards! Guards!</i> on hold! :D I also have <i>Feet of Clay</i> in my backpack (also <i>Going Postal</i> and <i>Unseen Academicals</i>), to be picked up whenever I finish <i>Soul Music</i> because evidently I can&#39;t read since this particular Death book was clearly on the shelf when I got to the library. :D Susan Sto Helit is <i>awesome</i>, by the way. I&#39;ll keep your recommendation of <i>Night Watch</i> in mind!<br><br>Ye-up, I&#39;m a Gryffy. Hufflepuff, however, is awesome and dearly needs some more House Points because of that awesomeness.<br><br>Ooh, yes, Roran, I forgot I actually liked him too in Brickingr! Er, Brisingr. The third one. He&#39;s pretty cool, since apparently heeeee didn&#39;t need magical guardian angel dragons to do all his crazy feats of improbability like <i>193 kills</i>. I agree with you on Eragon being an idiot, though I think Roran still had at least one sensible bone in his body by the time <i>Inheritance</i> finished with him.<br><br>I know where Kippur is on the net, but thanks for reminding me the sporkings are funny! I might go re-check them out, actually.<br><br><i>I used to wonder what friendship could be / &#39;till you all shared its magic with me~</i> Eh? Favorite character(s)? Roll 1d6 and pick whichever of the mane cast you want, I can&#39;t decide. Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle are probably a liiittle higher because I see more of myself in them, though. I need to actually finish watching the first freakin&#39; season before I get completely spoiled for everything... (Or cave and go looking for spoilers.

            <p>It depends on what sort of characters you like. There are several casts which take it in turns to be the main one and occasionally interact. There&#39;s Rincewind the Inept Wizard who is the main character in The Colour of Magic, The Light Fantastic, Sourcery (Yes that is the right spelling), Eric and several others. The witches of the Ramtop mountains who first appear in Equal Rites and Wyrd Sisters. Death who has Mort and Reaper Man. The City Watch with Guards! Guards!, Men at Arms, Jingo and various others. Moist von Lipwig with Going Postal and Making Money.<br>All of that isn&#39;t even including the one off cast books like Monstrous Regiment and Pyramids.<br>What I did was get them out of the library at random and this worked fine. I&#39;ve read all of the main novels, but not much supplementary material.</p>

            <p>Mort is the first Death book, then Reaper Man, he has a part in Soul Music, then there&#39;s Hogfather. On a related note there&#39;s Thief of Time.<br>Vetinari turns up in most of the books, but is rarely a main character. His early appearances aren&#39;t anything like how he is later.

            <p>It&#39;s nice to finally meet you, Lilac Lielac, after all that alleged stalking. :P Words are good, too! Especially if you use them correctly, which you do. If you want Permission, you&#39;ve probably seen the guide but I&#39;ll reiterate it here: hang around and participate long enough for us to get to know you fairly well (a month is about the usual length of time), and develop your ideas for agents in the meantime. Then, when you&#39;ve been here a while, post with your Permission request, your agent ideas (with description and backstory) and a sample of your writing.<br><br>You have an impressive list of fandoms. I am with you on the Harry Potter front: Pottermore declared me a Gryffindor, but I still have lots of love for the other houses. And it&#39;s rare for me to meet another player of RuneScape; howdy, buddy! :D Totally agreed with you re: the Stone Angels, too - those things have been a source of terror for me since <i>Blink</i>. <br><br>And yay, a LOTR fan, too! Read more Discworld, and you will have completed my Holy Trinity (LOTR, Harry Potter, and Discworld). XD<br><br>I think you&#39;re going to fit in pretty well here; you&#39;ve read the Constitution, you know how to use the wiki, and you&#39;re clearly a fan of fandoms. I am rather with you on the headcanoning/worldbuilding aspects of writing in canon, too. I think I like you. :P<br><br>I might point out, though, that Twilight and The Inheritance Cycle aren&#39;t generally very popular around here, so maybe don&#39;t expect <i>too</i> much enthusisasm for them. But we won&#39;t look down on you for liking them. :) <br><br>Oh, I knew there was something I was forgetting. *rummage* As a gift of welcome, please accept this bag of pebbles and Random Shiny Object. They are very good at being distracting, both for yourself and for fanfic creations you want to deal with.<br><br>So, uh... I never do know how to finish these things. :P Glad to have you on Board!</p>

            <p>Yep, I know the Permission guidelines. If I&#39;m still around here in a month I&#39;ll probably be staying for a while longer anyway; funny how my gauge of steady attention is about the same length of time as getting known here. :D<br><br>Impressive... ehe, I just read all the things and get attached.<br><br>Runescape, yes, yesss, I do play that. Even if I am greatly annoyed by that Squeal thing, I am a sucker for excellent content and the combat overhaul looks to be just that. I might even forgive them for the recent dearth of quests, I want to have to keep working for my quest cape!<br><br>Blink didn&#39;t scare me much. I mean, I watched it at night like a fool and I only got a little unnerved, but The Time of the Angels and Flesh and Stone are full on hide behind the couch terror just thinking about them. That which contains the image of an Angel itself becomes an Angel, and all that.<br><br>I want to read more Discworld, really I do! Do you have any recommendations?<br><br>Yay! ^.^ It&#39;s always nice to find kindred spirits, in headcanoning especially.<br><br>Oh, those? Those are only on the list because I participate in their fandoms in some way: Twilight by consuming what other people have made, and Inheritance because I have ideas for fanfic. I think the sources are as fail as anything, though if I had to choose I&#39;d say I prefer Inheritance because while I prefer Problematic Gary Stu Murderer Guy to Problematic Stalker Boyfriend And Also Pedowolf. Also I actually kind of like the first book of Inheritance, and Brom, and Elva, and Nasuada and Murtagh. Those few gems don&#39;t make up for a pile of dreck with an urple centerpiece of Eragon Drecksson Shadeslayer, but they&#39;re enough for fanfic material.<br><br>Pebbles? Ooo- Random Shiny Objects! -yoink-<br><br>Finishing? What&#39;s that? I mean, I think I did that once, but ...</p>

            <p>I get confused enough by regular combat sometimes, I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ll handle a whole new system. I&#39;m not an especially hardcore RuneScaper, I don&#39;t even have membership for any of my accounts (it&#39;s too expensive). :P<br><br>Blink played into one of my biggest phobias - I have a horror of things creeping up from behind to <i>get</i> me. I&#39;ve not watched much Doctor Who, though, which is probably just as well given the creepy things I&#39;ve heard about.<br><br>Hm, Discworld... I recommend the Night Watch arc books as a way to get really stuck into the setting. Beginning with Guards! Guards!, it goes through seven more books where the Night Watch are the main focus, and they also appear in... well, pretty much any book set in Ankh-Morpork. I also heavily recommend the Lancre Witches books, beginning with Equal Rites; the Tiffany Aching books are a sort of spinoff/sequel to the Lancre Witches arc.</p>

            <p>Hrmm. From what I can tell from the Behind the Scenes videos it doesn&#39;t look that complicated, just a bit more like WoW&#39;s combat system. Which I&#39;m not complaining about at <i>all</i>, because one of the things one can do with the new action bar is put potions and food on it. And then you press the hotkey applied to that particular icon on the hotkey bar and your character drinks or eats that item. And then I don&#39;t have to worry about going over all panicky and clicking the wrong way with my mouse and dragging instead of drinking when I&#39;m trying to do the 3 saradomin brews dose then 1 super restore dose thing and I&#39;m dying a little too quickly for comfort.<br><br>Hrmmm. Too bad, RS has the most awesome quests I can think of any MMO having. (OK so I&#39;m a little uninformed. RS is about the most expensive MMO my family can afford, and that only because I proved to my mum waaaay back when that I really did want it by slaving my butt off getting $30 bucks as an initial payment.)<br><br>Ehee. I&#39;m more about the inability to see them move and the inability to see them <i>at all</i> if it&#39;s dark, though even that didn&#39;t scare me too much until the whole &quot;oh yes and they also reproduce through images of themselves. Including images of them IN YOUR HEAD&quot; thing and also the &quot;and if you record them and there&#39;s static they can move between the static...&quot;. That kind of terrified the living daylights out of me, since I&#39;m a pretty visual person. Now I&#39;m unfortunately jumpy at night.<br><br><i>Soul Music</i> had made its way to Ankh-Morpork by the time I had to put it down or fall asleep on it, and I&#39;m pretty sure I saw a mention of the Night Watch. I also have <i>Feet of Clay</i> and <i>Going Postal</i>. :D  I also saw <i>Equal Rites</i> on the shelf but decided not to get it... and the library&#39;s closed today. Bah, I can always put another Discworld book on hold.</p>

            <p>When you put up chapter three, I felt inspired and <a href="http://uneducatedopinionsonthings.blogspot.co.at/2012/06/fifty-shades-of-grey.html">rambled</a> about it a bit. Seems like I foresaw how it would play out.<br><br>I just binged through all the new chapters, and wow, you should rename it to Fifty Shades of Wrong. Seriously, if this wasn&#39;t written from Ana&#39;s perspective and played totally straight, it would work as some kind of psychological thriller.<br><br>Also, ligaments: I&#39;m currently sitting out my second ligament injury. The first was at the ankle. I was basically announcing myself by giving off a variation of &quot;ow&quot; at every second step. The splint helped, though. Dang, I can&#39;t even remember which ankle it was any more.<br><br>The second, more recent one&#39;s at my right knee. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s permanent, since, if it&#39;s been overstretched, it most likely won&#39;t shrink down again, but it got better to a certain degree. I was able to walk home (very carefully), but I did take some wrong steps and ended up on my rear end once. I wrapped my knee up, which helped a lot. Again, I could walk, I just had problems with sharp corners. While I still feel it, I can walk around normally and run. Let&#39;s see what the MRI says.<br><br>Bottom line: Nobody had to nurse me back to health. In both cases I was able to walk back home (down a mountain/up a hill, respectively). In both cases I was almost free of pain as soon as the injuries had been taken care of. Hell, for the second one (which was worse, in my opinion), I went to work. Two days after it happened.<br><br>He should have broken his leg or something. That would have been a <i>reason</i> for mom to stay at home.</p>

            <p>CoC is a game though. A decently well-programmed one, and a fairly well-written one. I&#39;m pretty sure it falls more under the Your Kink is Not My Kink rule, unlike 50 Shades, or Twilight, which actually are poorly written.</p>

            <p>I found the fanfic 50 Shades is based on a few weeks back.

Universal has apparently picked up 50 Shades for a movie deal. I can&#39;t really wrap my head around how they&#39;re going to get less than an NC-17 rating, and keep a runtime longer than 30 minutes.</p>

            <p>John Green of Nerdfighters fame did complain about this, but not the novel itself. He claims that Amazon.com business plan of cutting out the editor hurts novels&#39; quality. He thinks that bookwriters need editors, and the traditional business model of writer-editor-writer-editor-publisher chain works really well for 500 years.

            <p>I found an article about it in our local newspaper. It was praised for being so taboo and edgy because it dared to talk about BDSM. Oh, and it called Ana an educated woman. Does that show in the book? Like, in any way?<br><br>The &quot;critique&quot; (and by that I mean &quot;plot summary plus praise for talking about BDSM in detail&quot;) awarded it 4 of 6 stars, while also calling it the Twilight saga for grown-ups.<br><br>Oh, and the main article called it soft porn for women.

            <p>Oh, it talks about BDSM. In detail. It just gets a lot of it wrong. Christian Grey is a terrible dom- seriously, anyone who gives their prospective sub alcohol before negotiating terms of their lifestyle does not deserve to have a sub. <br><br>As for Ana being educated- well, I&#39;m only up to chapter three, but so far she&#39;s about to graduate, and she wrote an essay on Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles. So basically, it&#39;s a token attempt to show her intelligence, while giving no concrete proof. I think. I&#39;ll keep you updated. <br><br>So far, I&#39;m awarding it no stars, but that&#39;s mainly because I can&#39;t get over James having Grey&#39;s office building contain sandstone floors and solid sandstone desks. It&#39;s possibly the most stupid thing I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. I haven&#39;t reached the sex yet, but so far this book has grated on my nerves in every possible way. </p>

On that list is also That Series, Sweet Apple Massacre, and quite possibly Cupcakes.<br><br>I haven&#39;t read this 50 Shades of Gray, although I read a story with the same title about a retired soldier who went nuts and killed himself and 49 other people after he was shot in the head and survived but was left colorblind. The latter wasn&#39;t too bad, even if it needed a touch of work. The former sounds so horrible it might make even the toughest of us break down and cry. Or, if we still have some will to live left, break down and get the TF2 Pyro to help us. (Reminding me that, and this is off topic by a million miles, Meet the Pyro is out tomorrow.

            <p>Yes. Yes you should have. Think. When Sporky stands up and warns you away, STAY THE HELL AWAY. You&#39;re talking to a guy who can say he has happily daydreamed about ripping people limb from limb and gutting them (I should see a psychiatrist about that). When I say it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s bad. When I say &quot;it made my stomach churn&quot;, you know you&#39;re going to vomit.<br><br> Y&#39;know what&#39;s scary? I mentioned to my mother I heard a lot of bad about 50 Shades of Gray, and she said she heard nothing but good. And I was given a brief description of the book, so... Yeah. Not sure if it&#39;s funny or disturbing that the people who say good are mostly women, either.</p>

            <p>Aye. See, my own morbid curiosity knows no bounds. I wanted to spork Cupcakes personally until I found out Fritz (I can&#39;t remember the Boarder&#39;s name; I have a funny tendency to call people by their Agents&#39; names) already did it. I was gonna do SAM for my first once I found out Cupcakes was taken, but then I found out that was done too. I don&#39;t want to touch on the Molestia Trilogy- the sporking would be over a hundred chapters, quite possibly- but I want a Legendary Badfic for my first target.

You never had sanity to lose, dearie.<br><br> I find it quite disturbing that people could call this good writing, based on what I&#39;ve heard. Maybe worse love story than Twilight, from what I&#39;ve heard. Oh Celestia, I have an idea. I&#39;ll get it done later. I must read it for myself someday. Even if only for the sake of actually being able to diss the stuff later. I won&#39;t truly knock anything until I&#39;ve tried it. That&#39;s how I became a Brony.</p>

There are several reasons for this, but they all basically come down to the fact that you&#39;d 1) kill your spin-off before it even starts because you&#39;d never finish the first episode, or 2) kill your spin-off a bit later because starting off at that level of drama/awfulness means that you either have to settle for less in later episodes, or you have to maintain that high level or escalate it, and risk getting drummed out for having no clue what the PPC is really here for.<br><br>That&#39;s laughs, if you weren&#39;t aware. The PPC isn&#39;t about torturing each other with the most awful things we can find, it&#39;s about having fun. Legendary Badfic is notoriously bad for fun because it is so offensively god-awful. You have to really know what you&#39;re doing to pull off making a mission of it, and I promise you that not one of us really knew what we were doing with our first missions.<br><br>Just... don&#39;t do it. It will not end well.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Eeyup. Trilogy. Three books, entitled <i>Molestia, Lunaughty,</i> and <i>Twilust</i>, written and to be read in that order. Streakz is still working on <i>Twilust</i>, but the first few chapters are up.<br><br> Thus far, I&#39;m not sure if <i>Lunaughty</i> or <i>Twilust</i> is worse. On one hand, the former was full of bondage. On the other hand, the latter is quite a bit creepier. At the moment, they&#39;re all trapped in Blueblood&#39;s house while Twilight hunts them down one by one and seduces them. Yeah, not molests but seduces. Streakz&#39;s explanation for the change is long-winded, but it basically comes down to that forcing them won&#39;t accomplish her goal of bringing the Elements closer to one another. It&#39;s weird to say the least.</p>

            <p>Due to various factors, I&#39;m doing high school by correspondence courses. (This is really annoying when I&#39;m procrastinating everything under the sun... yay, I&#39;m 16 and still in grade 10 due to my own laziness.) When I was doing grade 9 courses I had a choice between applied, applied, or applied, so just for a change of pace with my maths I did applied. (The other option&#39;s academic, which is what I <i>want</i> if at all possible but it wasn&#39;t available then.) This didn&#39;t look like a problem until last December. Then I wanted to enroll in a new grade 10 course, specifically academic maths, and the gorram thing required specifically academic grade 9 maths where all the other academic grade 10 courses had a prerequisite of the grade 9 course but didn&#39;t care if it was academic or applied.<br><br>I was <i>annoyed</i>. This, for the unaware, is pronounced <i>shriekingly furious.</i><br><br>Okay, a little backstory. I&#39;ve been going to a monthly/weekly (depends on the level) enriched maths thing since I was 10, learning maths we wouldn&#39;t get taught at our grade level, or at all until university, and getting past contests as homework so we can do well on the yearly ones and impress people and get scholarships and whatnot. In November I did a contest for grade 9/10 called the Canadian Intermediate Mathematics Contest (CIMC) and got 41/60, which is apparently a really good score because I got a certificate of distinction.<br><br>Since I really, really didn&#39;t want to settle for grade 10 applied maths because I&#39;d be in the same gorram boat with course-taking come grade 11, I went to the main instructor for the enriched maths, told him my problem, and asked if he&#39;d write a letter saying I was good enough to do the grade 10 academic since I&#39;d heard he did that sort of thing. He agreed, suggested sending a photocopy of my CIMC certificate would help make my case (The phrase &#39;definitely enough&#39; was used. He was pretty emphatic about it.), and I sent off my request to enroll and the various things to make my case.<br><br>Cue a wait, and then a [BLEEP]ing boilerplate letter saying (paraphrased) &quot;[Apology], [student name here]. [Course name here] is unavailable because: out of textbook copies.&quot; Yeah, I was back to being <i>annoyed</i>, because I didn&#39;t even know what level refusal this was so I had no idea if a second request would be met with &#39;you don&#39;t have the prerequisites&#39; when the first request had been entirely &#39;Yes. Yes I do. I&#39;m serious about this, too.&#39;<br><br>I sighed, enrolled in grade 10 science, and went on my merry way until I sent off my first unit of science about a week ago and could enroll in another course. Grade 10 academic maths, you guess? You would be correct!<br><br>Guess what e-mail I got in my inbox today. Go on, guess. I&#39;ll give you a hint: <i>I&#39;m finally enrolled in grade 10 academic maths yes yes yes yes yesssss!!!!!</i><br><br>... that was five exclamation points, wasn&#39;t it. Oops. -takes the underpants off her head-<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve already burst the eardrums of my nearest and dearest, so I&#39;ve come to babble at you, oh PPCers. To make this more than a congratz party, I&#39;ve a question: what sort of courses do you like to take, for whatever reason? Or liked to take, if you&#39;re no longer in any sort of schooling?</p>

            <p>I would have liked to have done more math, but I date back to when teachers could get away with telling all the female students that we were genetically incapable of learning it (instead of, you know, actually explaining things).  This wasn&#39;t exactly an incentive to take more than the minimum requirements.  If I had bothered to remember the names of all my junior high and high school math teachers, I might be tempted to photocopy my math-check credits in a few Hero System books and send the copies off to them.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t get into &quot;Physics For Poets&quot; in college, that course always filled up fast.  And yes, that was the real course name, in the catalog and everything.  It was a 100-level physics course meant for non-science majors.  I did get into the equivalent chemistry course and a 100-level astronomy course, both of those were fun.<br><br>I&#39;ve also enjoyed history since grade school.</p>

I don&#39;t know whether to laugh or get annoyed. I write poems when the mood strikes me, I suppose that makes me a poet, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not also a scientist at heart!

            <p>The reason I ended it with -/nitpick- is because &#39;bravo/brava&#39; is one of the things English ganked without accompanying grammar <i>but</i> I&#39;ve seen/heard the grammar sometimes used anyway.

            <p>It&#39;s always good to get news like that. :D<br><br>I remember back when I was doing my A-levels, I had to go through a bit of an annoying wait to find out what courses I could do.<br><br>In my first year at college, I&#39;d wanted to study German as an AS level. Sadly, due to my high school teacher being an utter incompetent, I didn&#39;t have the required grade and was instead told to try a fast-track Spanish GCSE and do a fast-track Spanish AS/A level the next year instead so I&#39;d still have two languages on my record (I was taking French too, and was rather better at that). I was kinda gutted, but agreed.<br><br>For various reasons, that year of college was rather a disaster. I pretty much failed all my AS courses (French, Sociology and Business Studies) but got a pass on the Spanish GCSE. I ended up requesting to re-sit my first year of college and swap Business Studies (which I loathed and had taken only because I thought I should) for Drama and Theatre Studies. They weren&#39;t too keen on me doing either - in England resitting an entire year isn&#39;t something that&#39;s done very often - and tried pointing out that I had no previous Drama qualifications.<br><br>I had a bit of a tussle with them over it, but eventually they relented and allowed me to re-register as a first-year, on the proviso that I&#39;d only get into the subjects I wanted if there was room after all the &quot;legitimate&quot; first-years had got what they wanted.<br><br>The phone call saying I&#39;d got into all four of the AS levels I wanted was <i>awesome</i>. I think I deafened my mum and her friends when I got off the phone.<br><br>I&#39;ve had a love for drama activities since I was in my teens and my friends gently bullied my extremely shy and withdrawn self into taking part in the annual school musical. (I say bullied, they just dragged me along to auditions, got me to practice the songs with them - no hard thing given I love singing - and then poked me through the door when it came time to actually audition.) It did a lot for me, and it was fun, so I rather fell in love with the idea.</p>

            <p>Mathematics has always been my favourite subject, along with physics and chemistry. This might explain why I&#39;m enrolled in physics at the University this year... <br><br>So, grade 10 math, eh? I think you&#39;re going to take on trigonometry this year. A word of advice: SOHCAHTOA. Let it be burned into your soul. If you&#39;ve got that down, then most trig problems aren&#39;t going to pose any problems... unless you&#39;ve set your calculator to radian mode, which one of my friends did for an exam. Answers come out <i>very</i> differently if you enter things in radians.<br><br>Oh, that reminds me... if you&#39;re considering taking physics in the future <b>take calculus first</b>. Seriously, I took IB physics without the power of calculus, and realized one year later that I could have simply differentiated and integrated my way though 70% of the problems (darn you, simple harmonic motion!).<br><br></p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve got a good teacher, they can show you how to work out a problem without using calculus, but that&#39;s the &quot;long way around&quot;. For example, instead of calculating bit by bit the total displacement of a moving object when given its velocity equation, you can just differentiate the entire thing and obtain the answer in one go. Simple harmonic motion problems become ridiculously easy when you can differentiate the position equation to find the velocity equation (differentiate again to find acceleration) but become a nightmarish tangle if you haven&#39;t memorized certain relevant equations. <br><br>But don&#39;t worry. Everything gets a whole lot more interesting when you talk about nuclear physics... THAT unit was made of pure awesome.</p>

            <p>All right then, mini calculus lesson.<br><br>Differentiating is essentially finding the slope of a line or curve. Suppose you&#39;ve plotted Y = 9X on a graph. You will get this nice straight line with a slope of exactly 9. That slope is an indicator of how fast your Y-value is changing: in this case, it is increasing at a rate of 9. <br><br>Now plot Y = X^2 and take X=2. Your coordinate pair is (2,4). You want to find the slope of X^2 at X=2. The first time I saw this, I thought: &quot;But it&#39;s a curve! How am I supposed to find the slope of a curve?&quot;<br><br>Now, the interesting stuff starts: try finding the slope of the line between X=3 and X=1. The answer is a slope of 4. Repeat it again using smaller increments closer to X=2: X=1.5 and X=2.5, X=1.75 and X= 2.25, etc... Now, you&#39;ll realize that you can&#39;t find it precisely at X=2 because the values would cancel each other out (a single point cannot have a slope), but you can get <i>really, really</i> close to the exact value, and that value is 4. If I take X=3 and do the same thing to it, I&#39;ll always end up with a slope of 6. If I take X=4, I&#39;ll get a slope of 8. <br><br>Do you see a pattern emerging here? The slopes of X^2 are determined by the function 2X. I have just differentiated X^2 and can predict the slope of any point on the X^2 curve! This means that I know how fast the Y-value is changing at a precise X-value, and it applies anywhere within the function&#39;s domain.<br><br>If I take X^3, I&#39;ll find that the slope of the X^3 curve is predicted by 3X^2. If I take X^4, I get 4X^3. See another pattern?<br><br>I have just demonstrated the power rule to you: the derivative of any function raised to a power can be represented as such:<br><br>Derivative of X^n is nX^(n-1).<br><br>This is but one of the many rules of differentiation but just as long as you remember that you are looking for the slope of an equation, it&#39;ll make a lot more sense.<br><br>A practical example: a car&#39;s position can be plotted using D= t^2. Find velocity and acceleration at any time <i>t</i> if speed at t=0 is 0 m/s.<br><br>1st derivative of position is speed: d/dt= 2t m/s.<br><br>2d derivative of position is acceleration (differentiate speed): d^2/dt^2= 2 m/s^2. </p>

            <p>In England I&#39;ve just finished my first year of AS Levels.

Next year I&#39;ll drop Drama and Theatre and if I don&#39;t get good enough grades to continue the other three as A Level, do an AS in something like Media.<br>The first year of A Levels is known as AS and three or four subjects is typical. The second year is known as A and three subjects is typical. You have to do a subject at AS to continue it at A.</p>

            <p>So in the first year of A levels you can take only AS courses, and then in the second you can take A courses based on your first year of AS courses and/or more AS courses?

            <p>It&#39;s so frustrating when bureaucratic nonsense gets in the way of school like that.  I definitely had a bit of that in college.<br><br>Let&#39;s see, courses I liked to take.  Once I had the backbone of requirements-for-my-major set up each year, I would usually grab an extra life science course and a literature course for fun.  Then, for a few extra course credits, I would grab an elective that felt interesting to me, like Anthropology or Psychology.<br><br>At NAU, I also volunteered to help reorganize the jarred animals in the Invertebrate Zoology specimen collection, which netted me three credits over three semesters!

            <p>We had lots and lots of preserved octopi and squids, and starfish, and all kinds of crabs and lobsters.  (Including our mascot, Skippy the slipper lobster!  So named because he had been stored in a former peanut butter jar.)  Also a few insects and spiders, one of which was a disturbingly large tarantula found in a local garage, according to the label.  Also, bedbugs from actual students&#39; dorms!  There was also a dry collection of seashells, which a Native American cleaning woman once stopped me to tell me about their significance in her culture.  Very cool!<br><br>Most of the collection was from the seventies, and had fallen into disrepair before my Invert Bio teacher inherited it.  Two girls and I volunteered to help him out with cataloging and re-preserving things that had run out of formaldehyde.  There were some sad sights.  Crabs that had dissolved into a puzzle of limbs and carapace bits.  Sea slugs that had lost all their formaldehyde and shriveled into teeny little raisins (although amazingly, adding new formaldehyde actually restored some of those to the point where they almost looked living again).  Also, we finally figured out why the room smelled <i>just</i> a bit worse than it should: a bucket of squids whose lid had never quite been fastened on all the way had been sitting behind the door under a pile of other buckets since about 1990.<br><br>. . . That kind of got long-winded.  Sorry!</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve just finished school – in fact, I had my last final today. Now, the system here in Israel works this way: You have to take some mandatory subjects (other words: English, Math, PE, History, Bible AKA Reading Comprehension, Literature AKA Mostly Horrible Poetry, Civics, and Grammar), as well as at least two optionals.<br>English and Math you get to choose the level – three points is the easiest, five the hardest. I took five English (though it&#39;s still, like all other levels, three finals and a project, which I wrote on JS Bach) and four Math.<br>My optionals were Cinema – three points theoretical, which is pretty fun (if the movie is good) and laughably easy (100s with no preparation at all, ho!), and two points practical, which is really hard (especially if, like me, you&#39;ve an incompetent editor and a lazy cameraman. Oh, and irresponsible actors) but fun and satisfying; and Philosophy, which is really fun, but hard – I think the philosophy tests were the hardest I had ever. Sad thing is, I wrote eight pages for each of the last two tests (the semi-final and the final) and probably I was the most laconic person in the classroom.<br>Also, instead of doing a test in Grammar, I decided to do a project in Linguistics (it ended being Discourse Analysis, which is slotted between Linguistics and Sociology, but eh). It was supposed to be large, but not university-large, highschool-large. It ballooned to the 25-page area (with the appendices, it is a whopping 61 pages) and is large enough (and has enough material, original research etc), AFAIK (and so my mom tells me), to be a BA project. It&#39;s in its closing stages; I&#39;ve just some small fixes to make. Hopefully I&#39;ll make it to the deadline (it&#39;s a long story, but the project&#39;s belatedness can be chalked down to three major factors: the Ministry of Education&#39;s bureaucracy – other words,  the Grammar department head taking weeks to read a page-and-a-half-long research proposal, communication problems between my advisor and me and her accursed perfectionism).<br><br>PS: I live in Israel. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagrut">Here</a> is a link to a Wikipedia article that gives some background info. </p>

            <p>Congratulations on finishing school!<br><br>Mandatory subjects are also something I have to do. Four English credits, one per grade; three math, one in either 11 or 12; 2 science... ah screwit <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/extra/eng/ppm/graduate.html">have a link that says the requirements for a high school diploma</a>. I&#39;m going with the highest level courses I can (academic in 9 and 10, university prep for 11 and 12) and I&#39;m only not taking every single math, science, and English course because taking anything not in the most academic stream would be a waste of my time. I&#39;m also taking 4 extra courses to take shameless advantage of the 34-course maximum which incidentally was only added recently. Boo, hiss, my options are already limited and I still had to flip coins to decide on my final courses.<br><br>Among my 12 planned whatever-you-want elective courses are pretty much all the science, most of the math, a course on Canadian law because it sounded interesting, and two history courses (world history to 16th century and world history from 16th century to now) to follow on from the required one (Canadian history since World War 1). For my first group of limited electives I&#39;m going with the Writer&#39;s Craft, which I am <i>very</i> happy about having available because creative writing is my lifeblood.<br><br>There&#39;s also a provincial literacy test, supposedly to be taken at the end of grade 9, that as a student outside of a school I can&#39;t <i>actually</i> take until I&#39;ve got eight credits. There are only 6 available grade 9 courses so even though I&#39;m already done with those I can&#39;t do the durn thing yet! &gt;:( [Bleep]ing bureaucracy. All the more reason to just get my schoolwork done, though, I know I can do things both incredibly fast and very well...</p>

            <p>Thank you. I am really glad this is behind my back. Next thing is either university (if I can get into the Academic Reserve) or Army service, preferably in the Air Force (both my father and his father were in the Air Force; granddad was a technician and dad dealt with computers).<br>Regarding bureaucracy: Just when you think a bureaucrat can&#39;t get more incompetent, he will. Example: I got a new mobilisation order today (it&#39;s for October 21st, though, so no rush). The only difference from the last one, sent three months ago? The ink&#39;s hue.<br>Or take this for an example: They sent me an invitation to a conference. The conference was four days ago, at the 25th. I got the invitation three days ago, at the 26th. &gt;.<br> </p>

            <p>Though, the jewel in crown is this: I tried to get into the IDF Spokeperson Unit. I passed the first sorting easily enough, and waited for them to summon me to the second stage. Usually, they send a summons by mail. They didn&#39;t do so. They informed me twelve hours before the second stage, by SMS, that I have to be at a certain army base. Just... eh.<br>At least I live two hours&#39; car-ride away. Someone I know lives in a hole in the middle of nowhere in the Golan. Got the same twelve-hour warning; they had to wake up in the middle of the night and rush to the car.</p>

            <p>...Y&#39;know, it&#39;s fics like this that make me wonder what the holy hell is *wrong* with some people!

            <p>This is much improved from your older reports!  Gaspard&#39;s personality and feelings come across much more strongly than they have in the past.  His dialogue/narration helped bring me along through the badfic and the awful revelations it produces, rather than just responding to the badfic itself.  (I like how you did this using very minimal badfic excerpts, too.)  Gaspard&#39;s emotional change, from the initial denial of the fic&#39;s nature, to the final moment of shock at Orion&#39;s murder, also has an excellent progression as the report goes on.<br><br>I also like that your actual post above feels like something that slipped out of an HQ computer, fitting in with other recent events.  I only just caught Gaspard&#39;s one-week leave below, which would have been some frightening foreshadowing if I had caught it in advance, considering how hard vacation time is to secure in the PPC.<br><br>Couple of issues.  Early on, Gaspard describes the Rainbow Factory as a &quot;factory-like building&quot; quite a bit.  This feels a little generic for me, since factories can be all kinds of different shapes and sizes.  As it is, I&#39;m imagining a Generic Factory, and I imagine even the badfic gave it more description than that.<br><br>Also, in the sentence, &quot;Now there’s a speech being given to the crowd by the some of the factory officials to the traumatized crowd,&quot; you&#39;ve got a &quot;to the crowd&quot; phrase in there twice.</p>

            <p>Okay... first of all, I have no idea how that ended up here. It was supposed to go right to Intelligence. That&#39;s a severe security leak here.

            <p>Hi Jack! Do you now how many things the name/word jack can mean? It could be an object used for raising things short distances, or a playing card, or a connecting device in an electrical circuit, or a name, or it could be short for jackdaw, which is a type of bird. Or jackrabbit. I&#39;m going on a tangent aren&#39;t I? Oh well, the PPC isn&#39;t really known for sanity.<br><br>So, back on topic. Welcome to the PPC! Please check out the links above, they contain helpful things like our rules and guides. One doesn&#39;t actually become an agent but after a certain  amount of time you can apply for Permission and write stories about agents.

            <p>Hello Newbie. I was wondering, have you read Warbreaker? I was considering a Lifeless agent, then remembered I&#39;d given a character a fear of zombies, which she wouldn&#39;t let me take away.<br>The thing about the Mistborn is that they are going to win if there is metal about. It might be interesting to have your character only be able to burn one metal or have limited supplies. That way the agent can&#39;t simply rely on one skill.</p>

            <p>I have read all of Sanderson&#39;s published work, so yes, I have. The reason that I was thinking mistborn was if I wasn’t to go into ESAS, He/she would need strong magic. Also, I can envision a lot of ways the laws of narrative comedy could affect allomancy. Besides, the agent would only have as much metal as he brought with him from HQ. Same thing with the Radiant agent, he would have limited stormlight in the same manner.</p>

            <p>I could not think of a tl;dr for this: please bear with me. This continuity is near and dear to my heart, and as such I am delighted with the idea of agents from it. As such, I couldn&#39;t help but give this as much thought as I could.<br><br><b>&#39;Wow&#39; I:</b> yay, Sanderson fan! I&#39;ll admit to not having read everything by him--haven&#39;t read the short works or Alloy of Law yet, and I refuse to touch Wheel of Time with a Standard Adventurer&#39;s Ten Foot Pole, but he is one of my three favorite authors, at least in genre.<br><br><b>&#39;Wow&#39; II:</b> I&#39;ll attempt not to use spoilers here, but we shall see.<br><br><b>1: Mistborn)</b> Mistborn have special cloaks that tell people walking past them, especially at night, &quot;Hey ho a Mistborn passes here.&quot; It&#39;s as much a warning as any Scalloped Bat-Cape throwing a shadow in the dead of night, giving the heads &quot;and some Bat-operative, the Man himself or not, will stop All Crime Found Here.&quot; Noble houses <em>covet</em> Mistborn. Hell&#39;s bells, they covet any kind of Allomancer. Allomancers can seem very common in the books, but remember that we are following a group specifically gathered to <em>be</em> a combat strike team of Allomancers, and against groups which similarly gather them. Consider the non-nobles/government/Kelsier-gathered population: <em>the numbers of Allomancers are much lower</em>, let alone Mistborn.<br><br>Mistborn are a commodity. They are precious. Unless in a situation with many of noble houses are in attendance--and we know how few people are actually in noble houses--very few people will actually see more than one Mistborn at a time in their whole lives. Kelsier and Vin are The Notable Exceptions To The Rule, as they <em>should</em> be by being PCs.<br><br>Besides, as far as being Mistborn goes, if I am not mistaken by Alloy of Law being Mistborn proper is not something that really happens anymore. Twinborn seems to be slightly more common than Mistborn had been in Vin&#39;s time, though still quite a bit rarer than single-metal Allomancers or Feruchemists.<br><br>Addendum: um, having only the metal brought from HQ is... not a limitation. Any Allomancer or Mistborn only has as much metal as he&#39;s brought with him on any given excursion, or else that he scrounges up between resupplying, and the latter can be dangerous. That isn&#39;t a Special Limitation, that&#39;s just life as usual. Besides, a lot of Agents carry bags, or even Bags of Holding. You could dump a LOT of Allomancy metal in there. Not the best sell on that one.<br><br><b>2: Radiant)</b> There <em>used</em> to be many. They are, however, figures of legend, and being a Shardbearer is incredibly rare. Remember what some of the lengths gone to obtain them are, and how high the value stakes of what people have given up or demanded in exchange for a Shardeblade or Shardplate armor is. I&#39;m specifically remembering the truly poignant incident towards the end, regarding the fate of a platoon. Radiants are currently legends, and one reason several characters in that book are so visibly pivotal is because of the implication that they <em>are</em> Radiants, which haven&#39;t been seen in... a very long time, possibly centuries, that I do not recall off the top of my head.<br><br>Beyond that, we don&#39;t actually know yet how Stormlight works, thanks to Sanderson&#39;s brilliant ability to have us learn along with the characters how their magic works. I&#39;d hesitate to make a ruling on use of it in any direction until that is elucidated; at best I&#39;d say &quot;He gets a supply brought with him from home but it will run out if used.&quot; After all, we have no reason to believe at this point that Stormlight is found outside that universe, or even on that particular planet (as we have seen no indication of it in the other three worlds of that continuity).<br><br>Even if there were thousands of Radiants once, consider how many people are in the Stormlight world. There feel to be far, far more, population-speaking, than in Elantris or Mistborn (though Warbreaker feels to have rather a lot too). Even if by numbers this were more comparable to, as you have liked bringing up, the Harry Potter population ratios: They are <em>integrated</em> into society, and remember, the prologue tells us they were practically worshiped.<br><br><b>&#39;Wow&#39; III:</b> Based on your reply below, which I will respond to here: you&#39;ve gone about this the wrong way.<br><br>From section 1 on Mistborn, we can conclude an Allomancer (or, depending on when/where the character is from, a Feruchemist) is special, but only in the HP Wizard sense. Twinborn are rather more so, more like Special, but arguably (given the state of Scadriel by the time of Alloy) in the sense of the lead PCs of HP.<br><br>However, Mistborn are <em>Special Snowflakes</em>.<br><br>From section 2, we can conclude Radiants are Super Special Snowflakes. No, really.<br><br>All that said? I cannot in good conscience say &quot;Ahahaha no uberoverpowered&quot; off the top, not least because I&#39;ve had at least one agent on that scale. (Well, theoreticallyI do: I have a bad habit of not writing. Oopsherpderp.) It is easily possible to write an agent with remarkable powers and special backstory, and possible powers to go with it--Makari&#39;s Samuel, for instance, or the even more obvious Dafydd. In the former case, this was nicely underplayed; in the latter, he paid for it hard in spades by the end. It <em>can</em> be done. It just takes care.<br><br><em>However</em>--and this is the big &#39;however&#39;--for those two (as with most of the best Agents we&#39;ve had) having the powers wasn&#39;t the reason to construct a character, it was part of character development. Your problem is that you&#39;re thinking the powers explicitly for the sheer sake of Being Specially Awesome. Remember the original Agents were just plain <em>human</em>.<br><br>Referencing the thread below to which I first responded: you said you were thinking only in terms of &#39;personality traits,&#39; but actually it was SingingTheThunder who suggested personality traits. You did not. You asked for ideas for personalities for two characters with powers. That advice you took, and then back-pedaled asking for powers for a personality someone else had suggested. You hadn&#39;t even thought of it yourself. Even that idea, of &#39;a slightly cracked Mistborn who forgets about his powers&#39; is still focusing on the Allomancy, not on the Agent.<br><br>This is not a good way to construct any character, Agent, fic, or original work. You <em>can</em> make those overpowered characters work--I&#39;d still say hold off on the Radiant, too little information and too high a status in Roshar&#39;s mythology--but don&#39;t think about the powers. Think about what kind of <em>person</em> would be interesting to read about, what kind of person would be entertaining to challenge and make jokes with. Either the powers will come naturally or they won&#39;t.<br><br>The right touch could manage it. As you&#39;re currently approaching it, I would caution against doing so.<br><br><br>(A brief appendix: Dude, you just hopped on board. Kick back, relax, get to know us and learn better how we work--and how our style writing works and how our Agents click. Making Agents comes in a little while. Don&#39;t think about it now. Let ideas bubble, let them brew, let them steep into a richer solution. Let the excitement ease up into something slightly less volatile.)</p>

            <p>No. <br><br>You&#39;ve already said more than enough here to make it clear that you should not have agents that have powers at all. <br><br>&quot;Well, the ESAS handels the really bad Warrior! and GOD MODE!Sues, so your agents can have pretty strong combat cabailites, so thats one thing.&quot;<br><br>Your interest in ESAS, as stated here, isn&#39;t in what it does, but what it allows you to do- which is have powerful characters.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m working on a few agents, a mistborn agen from the mistborn trilogy, a shardbeared/Knight Radiant from Stormlight archives, and Asha&#39;man from Wheel of time, and some others.&quot;<br><br>Asha&#39;man, for those not in the know, can access the &#39;male&#39; side of magic in the WoT &#39;verse. It then proceeds to corrupt the unpleasantly and drive them insane in bad ways if they use it too much. This is something of a Stu alert. <br><br><br>Mistborn, for those who haven&#39;t read Brandon Sanderson at all yet, are ridiculously powerful and/or ridiculously rare. In the time period of the Mistborn trilogy, Mistborn are very rare; their counterparts who can use only a single metal are more common, and even then they aren&#39;t everywhere either. Mistborn are able to influence emotions, propel themselves through the air, and make themselves super-strong and fast, among other things.<br><br>I cannot state with regards to the Shardbeared/Knight Radiant whatever since I&#39;ve not yet read.<br><br>So, again, no. </p>

            <p>Let me just say that, as someone who has read the Wheel of Time multiple times over, roughly, 13 years, I really really REALLY think you need to re-evaluate what an Asha&#39;man is.<br><br>&quot;Part the first: Read. Book. Nine.&quot;  Done that.  Multiple times.  Doesn&#39;t make the idea of having a living weapon around any more palatable.  See, taking that away doesn&#39;t make them less dangerous.  There are two choices in this case: 1) Pre-Book-9, where they go crazy and potentially lay waste to a large area with lots of fire and explosions that react to their every broken thought.  2) Post-Book-9, where they are still a <b>living weapon</b> with <b>fire and explosions at their fingertips</b> and lots of training to use it to solve <b>ALL their problems</b>.<br><br>&quot;Part the second, it appered that all PPC agents were mad.&quot;  The problem is that you seem to think all madness is equal.  It isn&#39;t.  Someone whose insanity manifests as them breaking down into tears at the first hint of bad grammar, is one thing.  Someone who permanently loses all grasp of reality and goes on a killing spree, is quite another.

I haven&#39;t read the book, so I don&#39;t know about the canon. But true insanity is actually something PPC agents try to stave off. With Bleeprin and other stuff. (Not to be confused with Stuff.)

            <p>There&#39;s no yes or no to that question. They can, but these powers should be handled reasonably. They shouldn&#39;t be easy plot devices. After all, what do you do when your agent&#39;s not human to begin with? Just... don&#39;t make your agents speshul. You&#39;ll get the gist of it soon enough.</p>

Mistborn make up a (small) precentge of the nobility in the final empire and an oddly large percentage of the illegitimate children of said nobles.

            <p>I can&#39;t say about the Stormlight one, but I think a slightly cracked Mistborn, similar to Kelsier, Zane or with trust issues like Vin at the start would be good.<br>It would be best for the character to be one of the nobility, as it was more likely for their powers to be discovered. If your character was say arrogant and thought they could do anything, then were constantly proved wrong, that would be amusing, especially if paired with an agent who relies a bit too much on common sense and expects everything to work logically.<br>You could go the opposite way and have a character who underestimates their power or forgets they have it (e.g not eating metal, not looking out for bits of metal to use).<br>On the subject of a partner it might be amusing to pair them with for example a werecreature, who is vulnerable to silver. Really you could give them any personality, but try to pick ones that cause tension when they meet.</p>

            <p>I have been following the PPC for a month, and have read the original series. It’s epic. I personally enjoy OFUs as well. I am currently working on an agent pair. One is a mistborn, meaning he eats metals to gain various powers (i.e. Push/Pull metal, Emotions, Boost strength/ senses etc.) The other is a Knight radiant, with some gravitational manipulations. They would probably be ESAS or heavy duty assassins.</p>

            <p>Eugh, it really does get annoying when the Mary Sues try to marry their lust objects. Especially when said lust objects are... say... <i>Aragorn</i>. Say it with me... Ar-wen E-ven-star! (Or if they&#39;re Faramir. <i>Eowyn* exists</i>, thank you!)<br><br>The general advice for newbies who want to write missions is stick around for a month or so, join in on conversations, make yourself a face people recognize so the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> Givers know who you are. Use the time to create an agent or two and make a writing sample, it&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.

            <p>Well, the ESAS handels the really bad Warrior! and GOD MODE!Sues, so your agents can have pretty strong combat cabailites, so thats one thing. I really like Wheel of Time, but that is a very small fandom, despite its popularity, and has very little badfic, due to the fact that it is not very fangirl-attractive.  Also, the Stormlight Archives (Brandon Sanderson) is a favorate of mine, but it is only on the first (thousand page) book of 10, and dosn&#39;t have a fandom yet.<br><br></p>

You don&#39;t need to be ready to write tomorrow. You won&#39;t be writing missions for a while. This isn&#39;t a time-critical, world-shifting event. This isn&#39;t a paying job or school assignment with a deadline. Don&#39;t get sucked in by nonexistent urgency.</p>

            <p>Missions aren&#39;t the only thing TO the PPC. You don&#39;t NEED to have an agent right away. Relax. Read people&#39;s missions. Get to know the people here.</p>
