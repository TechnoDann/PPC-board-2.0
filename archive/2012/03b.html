            <p>Regarding point A,<br><br>I really don&#39;t think I could handle the mental images that would come with this fic if it was properly descriptive.  It&#39;s bad as it is, and I don&#39;t think I could handle a higher level of description.<br><br>Still, it isn&#39;t mind-meltingly bad, just very, very, very bad.  I recommend an Eversor Assassin be injected into the world-construct to deal with Voldemort.  Gandalf can be healed with logical arguments, and this particular Sauron should be <em>nuked</em>.</p>

I&#39;m an avid gamer, especially with the Fallout and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. I&#39;m also a brony, and could probably talk a Sue to death on that subject matter (Rainbow Dash is best pony). I read too much for my own good, especially Terry Prachett, Douglas Adams, Michael Crichton and Stephen King, as eclectic as that selection is.<br><br>I have a mind composed mainly of Adamantium, and can stand fics that have made others run screaming for the hills. I invite the internet to give me the best (of the worst) its got.<br><br>I come prepackaged with my own insanity, so fitting in shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Just glad to be here!<br></p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Some of you guys may have already heard about E.L. James&#39; <i>50 Shades of Grey</i>, and its sequels <i>50 Shades of Darker</i> and <i>50 Shades of Freed</i>, which have been burning up the romance world lately. It&#39;s been called &quot;<i>Twilight</i> for adults,&quot; among other things, and has a light BDSM flavoring that&#39;s gotten a lot of attention in the romance community. What&#39;s equally well-known is that the trilogy began life as a <i>Twilight</i> AU fanfiction called &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; (anyone else imagining Edward Cullen in furry underwear now?) and had the protagonists&#39; names and details changed before publication. It seems to have replicated <i>Twilight</i>&#39;s success, if nothing else; 250,000 copies in various formats have been sold.<br><br>It&#39;s also . . . well, not very good, in my humble opinion. <a href="http://dearauthor.com/book-reviews/f-reviews/review-fifty-shades-of-grey-by-e-l-james">This review</a> on Dear Author sums up the situation far better than I ever could.<br><br>A followup <a href="http://dearauthor.com/features/industry-news/master-of-the-universe-versus-fifty-shades-by-e-l-james-comparison">article</a> compared the text of <i>50 Shades</i> with the text of the original fanfic, and found an 83% correlation between the two; the biggest changes were in altering the <i>Twilight</i> details, like the protagonists&#39; names. A publisher&#39;s representative called the fanfic and the published product &quot;two distinctly separate pieces of work,&quot; but the data doesn&#39;t exactly support that conclusion. Stephenie Meyer&#39;s people don&#39;t appear to have filed any lawsuits at this time, but given the correlation and the fact that E.L. James is sort of indirectly profiting from Meyer&#39;s work, it&#39;s possible. <br><br>So my question is: where does the PPC stand on this? Given its popularity, it&#39;s likely that we&#39;ll be seeing <i>50 Shades</i> fanfic at some point in the future. Do we treat it as a separate original universe, or as fanfic of a fanfic? Is it even possible to PPC fic of a fic? And how the hell can I publish <i>my</i> fanfiction for loads of money?</p>

Acacia Byrd pulled the sheets down and glowered at her onetime partner. Jay just beamed.<br><br>&quot;We have to stop meeting like this - people will talk.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What are you <i>doing</i> here, Jay?&quot; Acacia demanded. &quot;It&#39;s been ten years, can&#39;t you just leave me alone?&quot;<br><br>Jay pouted. &quot;Oh, you know you don&#39;t mean that, Acy.

This is not my idea of fun!&quot; She shook her head and sat up, rubbing her eyes. &quot;I suppose she&#39;s back again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;For once, no,&quot; Jay said. &quot;This is something else. A romance novel.&quot;<br><br>Acacia stared. &quot;We&#39;re in a <i>romance novel</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not as far as I know,&quot; Jay said. &quot;One&#39;s just been published - Fifty Shades of Somethingorother?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve read it,&quot; Acacia muttered. &quot;It&#39;s not very good. So?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Apparently it&#39;s just a Twilight fanfic with all the names changed, aaaaaaand I got an email from, wow, from over a hundred agents asking us to-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you didn&#39;t even-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. A thousand times no. We&#39;re <i>retired</i>, Jay. No more PPCing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not even-&quot;<br><br>&quot;NO.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay.&quot; Jay shrugged. &quot;That&#39;s what I thought you&#39;d say. Now, onto more important business.&quot;<br><br>Acacia&#39;s eyebrows went up. &quot;There&#39;s more?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There sure is... <i>you</i> read <i>romance novels</i>?&quot;<br><br>The flying pillow hit her neatly in the head. &quot;Just go downstairs and start the coffee, Jay.&quot;<br><br>------------<br><br>hS, muahaha</p>

            <p>And this is why some forms of literature should not be rewritten and published.<br><br>If the series had indeed began as fanfiction, then subsequently altered for the general public, hen I think it was done poorly for one critical reason: the underpinning tones and ideologies. <br><br>In fanfiction, IMO, it&#39;s relativly fine to, say, have these strange fantasies and whatnot about relationships and how they would turn out, etc. But if an author is writing for the general public, then that needs to entail the maturity and responsibility that can be expected of such a writer; real world experience needs to come to the fore here.

            <p>Heh, I&#39;ve been here for five years and I still don&#39;t know the answer to questions like these. I doubt we&#39;ll ever reach a solid conclusion.<br><br>And you have an interesting point. Fanfiction occupies a very different niche from published fiction; it presumes a certain level of familiarity with a preestablished setting, for starters, and is much more of a personal exercise in indulgence. (I say this as someone with eleven years of fanwriting under my belt. XD) Stripping fanfic and publishing it as original fic may not be illegal, but it&#39;s questionable and ethically unsound.</p>

            <p>...Well, since Bram Stoker is the father of Dracula, and Dracula was the vampire that basically defined vampires... *eyetwitch* Bram Stoker/Steph Meyer? Lolno.<br><br>Heh. Good luck with the marrying-off thing. Most of my!vampires have RAGING commitment issues. RAGING. Because, you know, it&#39;s a bit hard to hold down a relationship when you&#39;re both just trying to stay sane. (My friend and I do a lot of World of Darkness stuff, so our vampires are... ya know. XD}<br><br>Not to mention that in some of these &#39;verses, vampire&#39;s... um... parts don&#39;t work? And in most of them, they&#39;re either not interested in sex, or obsessed with the kinkiest, creepiest kind.<br><br> Either way, I feel sorry for Bella&#39;s grandbabies. XD</p>

            <p><u>Vamp War I</u><br><br>&quot;... all possible efforts have been made to bring this crisis to a peaceful resolution. Their having failed, we have no option but to resort to military force. As of noon today, this nation is at war with the Empire of Rice.&quot;<br><br>Bella switched the TV off with a sigh. &quot;How did it come to this?&quot; she asked the empty air. &quot;It wasn&#39;t so long ago we vampire nations were allied against the world.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They blame us, you know,&quot; a voice said from the shadows. Bella squinted, trying to make out the hooded figure she knew had to be there, but to no avail. &quot;They say we corrupted the noble race of vampires - something like that.&quot;<br><br>Bella grimaced. &quot;I know, Grandmother,&quot; she said. &quot;The Stokerites have always had it in for me. Us. Whatever.&quot;<br><br>&quot;At least we have allies,&quot; Grandmother pointed out. &quot;All the newer nations are firmly on our side.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what use are they?&quot; Bella despaired. &quot;With Rice against us, the Butchers and Lukyanenkoids will rally to her flag. We are so massively outnumbered we need a new word for it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Court the Whedonites,&quot; Grandmother suggested. Bella snorted.<br><br>&quot;Them? They hate us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But they hate Rice as well,&quot; Grandmother pointed out. &quot;If we make concessions - some influence in the new nations, perhaps - they may fall in line.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work,&quot; Bella said glumly. &quot;Isn&#39;t there anyone else?&quot;<br><br>But Grandmother was gone.<br><br>-------<br><br>Muahaha.<br><br>hS</p>

He didn&#39;t want to get, say, eaten alive by a swarm of bats.<br><br>A wave of blood-hot anger engulfed him. Stokerites thought they were better than every other kind of vampire, because they came first and were stronger. Well, from where Lorcan was standing, they seemed like just another clan to him. And he HATED the way they looked down at him and his for being &#39;younger&#39;.<br><br>He fingered the two-bladed knife on his belt, and took a deep breath. It would really suck if he let the Beast out now. Stokerites were freggin&#39; NASTY. <br><br>Lorcan scowled. Why couldn&#39;t he have had a Pratchettian as his partner? They had a sense of humor at least. Or a Whedonite, they were awesome. H*ll, even a Whovian vampire would be better, and they were giant fish-aliens in disguise.<br><br>/Allied High Command is a b-/<br><br>The mark rounded the corner.

            <p>I have to admit to having read some of these books. There is no sex in the book series until one scene in the very end of book six. Book seven is where it starts to be in more, and also where she starts becoming more Sue-like. I read I think up to book nine maybe, by which point she was a complete sex-crazed Sue.<br><br>When she first appears in book one, she&#39;s much more of a badass normal. She has some talent with her necromancy powers, but is a fairly low-level minion at a company that provides necromancy services. If memory serves (it has been a long while since I read them), she was about on par with the average PPC agent. <br><br>By book nine she&#39;s the most powerful necromancer in history, part of an extremely rare triumverate, then the leader of an even rarer secondary triumverate, leader of a clan of were-panthers (I think, it was definitely some kind of smaller Big Cat), infected with several strains of were-things, but not shifting, infected with vampirism, but not showing the symptoms, infected with the armour which requires that she have sex constantly, and apparently it continues to get more grandiose in the books beyond nine.<br><br>She actually makes a really good warning as to what not to let our agents become.</p>

            <p>The Armour is my attempt to spell the French word for love. It was supposed to be a rare effect in that canon that some vampires had that made them need not only blood, but also sex/emotion. Like her primary vampire boyfriend (by book nine she had a whole harem, or whatever the term would be when it is applied to males), had this, but he is old and has it under control, and is sustained quite well by regular sex and being around a lot of emotion. He isn&#39;t required by the power to have sex immediately and constantly. Since she doesn&#39;t have it under control, she is. This is where the books devolved rather quickly into porn (and got pretty boring in the plot department. the last one I read was pretty muchly PWP.)</p>

I think I recall a rather awesome survey that was done at one point... could someone just copy and paste and do it again? Could we have another PPC newspaper?<br><br>Also.

            <p>This has been nagging at me for a long time, but is there any definitive scale for the size of animals, trees, and buildings in Redwall? About how tall would an agent native to Redwall be? In the cartoon you could clearly see a size disparity between the species, but not in the books. Is the cartoon considered canon? </p>

            <p>*adjusts unneeded glasses*<br><br> Well, yes, unfortunately, the cartoon is canon. It&#39;s published and authorized. As much as I hate to say it, the cartoon is part of the world. In a way, it is a world unto itself- as you say, there&#39;s a large size disparity. In the books, there was also a difference, but it wasn&#39;t quite so large. I&#39;d say mice and rats would have had no more than a foot or so of height difference, or equivalent. Badgers probably would have been eight or nine feet tall or equivalent. Maybe ten for larger ones like Gorath. Hares might have reached six and a half as opposed to a mouse&#39;s five and a half, and I&#39;d put foxes as five-foot-nine.<br><br> It all depends on whether you&#39;re writing for the cartoon or the books whether the sizing is correct. A mouse from the cartoon would probably be actual mouse-sized in HQ, like a mouse from Narnia, Celestia damn the place, while a mouse from the books would be able to look you or me in the eye and then claw it out if ze so desired. Good luck!</p>

            <p>I&#39;d suggest looking up the Redwall missions and agents on the Wiki. IIRC, the agents are all roughly around the same size as a human, and the buildings and trees in the canon seemed to be the same size to the animals that real world buildings and trees are to us.</p>

            <p>That is a problem.  There isn&#39;t a comprehensive history.  Your best source for the broad strokes is the wiki, specifically <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:PPC_History">this page</a>.<br><br>The incident you are referring to is probably one of the Mary Sue Invasions.  Both can be found on the above page, but I am thinking you probably want <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/2008_Mary_Sue_Invasion">this one</a>.</p>

            <p>AnnaBee asks for a history of the PPC &gt; You say there isn&#39;t one &gt; You link to a page which links to an article called &#39;History of the PPC&#39;. See?<br><br>I&#39;m aware that it&#39;s not comprehensive, since a comprehensive history is more accurately called a &#39;story&#39;, and I wrote most of those.

Following this, he was caught in the act by several PPC agents, and was recruited soon after. Marikane is eccentric, believing that The Flowers all take part in underground cage-fighting, getting rid of the common housefly by firing at it with Paul‚Äôs Fat-Man and, in one case, getting rid of a door-to-door salesman by using a portal generator to summon a Daedric Warrior. Marikane often insults works he‚Äôs sporking in a dry tone, often skipping to scenes where there‚Äôs crime being done so he can get out of the badfic before his alcohol supply runs out. Marikane is strongly against any form of abuse, and counts it as a crime above being a Mary Sue. <br><br>Sexual Orientation: Asexual in the sense he doesn‚Äôt want a permanent relationship, but he still has no problem flirting with people.<br><br>Fandom(s): Works of BioWare and Joss Whedon, Assassin‚Äôs Creed, Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Campaign only- despises the multiplayer), How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, Family Guy, The Simpsons. <br><br>Lust-object(s): Rachel Berry (Glee), Barris Offee (Star Wars).<br><br>Favourite(s): Most of the above, alongside Muse, Queen, Requiem for a Dream (His favourite movie soundtrack of all time), Sherlock (TV Series) and Sherlock Holmes (2009/2011 Movies).<br><br>Appearance: Marikane has disorganised dark-brown hair sticking around his head- he often tries to tame it by threatening it with his lightsaber and/or covering it in a big fedora, which he claims he snatched off a Stu in the Dresden Files universe before meeting Paul.<br><br>Weapon(s): Liberated Gauss Cannon that resembles the Gravity Gun from Half-Life off a Sue (‚ÄúShe was dead when I got there!‚Äù), one lightsaber, The Force (Or his ‚ÄúLightning hands‚Äù) for backup.<br><br>Paul Clarke:<br><br>Written by: Gone Rampant <br><br>Age: 27<br><br>Species: Human <br><br>Sexual Orientation: Straight.<br><br>Home Continuum: Fallout: New Vegas.<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters.<br><br>Division: N/A <br><br>Response Centre: 9777<br><br>Partner: Marikane Cananvi.<br><br>History: Paul was a version of the Courier in Fallout New Vegas, who, like Marikane, fell into a plot hole, landing on Marikane. He quietly became a member of the PPC in the resulting months, quickly settling into a Response Centre with Marikane. Paul is more quiet when off-mission, enjoying most, if not all, of the things Marikane enjoys, although while Marikane‚Äôs DVD rack is ‚ÄúOrganised chaos‚Äù in his words, Paul arranged all of his gear he had on him falling through the plot hole into a single corner, and it hasn‚Äôt had to be moved since.   <br><br>Fandom(s): See Marikane‚Äôs for the list- part of the reason they‚Äôre partners is because they have a lot in common. <br><br>Lust-object(s): Cortana (Halo), Black Cat (Spider-Man).<br><br>Favourite(s): See &quot;Fandoms&quot;. <br><br>Weapon(s): FN-FAL, Hunting Revolver, Maria (Benny‚Äôs 9M pistol).<br><br>Appearance: Paul wears the Vault-Suit Doc Mitchell gave him after he was shot by Benny at the start of New Vegas when not on missions. Right before he fell through he fell through the plot-hole, he found an Elite NCR Ranger outfit (Mostly for the duster, which has become regular clothing for whenever a mission allows it). <br><br>Sample (From my Glee story, ‚ÄúTattoos- Yes or No?‚Äù)<br><br>Hi there!

Mitchell and Jack glare at him, and he shrugs.<br><br>&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll stick to the script,&quot; he says. &quot;But you know what?&quot; he says more loudly, oblivious to the people behind him. &quot;We&#39;re not here to talk to you as gods living among mortals, who also happen to be very attractive and have large harems under false name. Don&#39;t deny it!&quot; he yells at the people behind him, who mumble incoherent sentences, except for Puck, who nods brightly.<br><br>&quot;You two scare me,&quot; Mitchell deadpans. &quot;Moving on...&quot; Jack says from behind the camera. Mitchell sighs heavily.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s right, we&#39;re here today, to tell you how to run your life,&quot; he says.<br><br>&quot;You know, a lot of you out there are probably considering purchasing a tattoo, or as young idiots like Finn call it, a (Clears throat) &quot;Tat,&quot;&quot; Daniel says in an informative manner.<br><br>&quot;Or,&quot; Mitchell buts in, &quot;Adding a tattoo to your already impressive, yet slightly pathetic, collection of random junk you&#39;ll never need.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So today, in this desolate corner of the world, where most people watch Justin Bieber videos on repeat,&quot; (Everyone stops to shudder at Daniel‚Äôs statement), &quot;Today we are presenting to you a very special, &quot;Point-Counterpoint&quot;, PSA,&quot; Daniel tells the audience.<br><br>Above him and Mitchell, in large white writing, the words, &quot;Point/Counterpoint: Should you get a tattoo?&quot;, and Mitchell repeats the second part of that sentence.<br><br>Daniel&#39;s name pops up in the corner, with a red line in between his name and his stance: Against.<br><br>&quot;I think it&#39;s quite clear that you should NOT get a tattoo,&quot; he tells the camera.<br><br>&quot;And I can summarise my points in this elegant, yet simple, bulleted list.&quot;<br><br>To Daniel&#39;s right, a list starts to unfold down the screen, containing his points, with him narrating as we go down the list.<br><br>&quot;Number one&quot;, he reminds everyone, &quot;Tattoos are permanent.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Number two&quot;, he continues. &quot;You are a God damn idiot.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And I&#39;d like to prove the second point mathematically,&quot; he tells the audience. &quot;Take your current age. Now take ten years off it. Were you smart back then? Of course you weren&#39;t; you were a God damn idiot.&quot;<br><br>By complete coincidence, the following words show up: Finn should die in a hole that should be filled with machine gun fire. Maybe then Rachel would notice me.<br><br>&quot;The fact of the matter is,&quot; he says, not even noticing the new point, &quot;You&#39;re just as much of an idiot now as you were back then, it&#39;s just gonna take you ten more years to figure that out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now think what would have happened if you&#39;d drawn a picture on your body back then- Would you be happy with it today?&quot; He asks.<br><br>&quot;The chances are, you wouldn&#39;t be.&quot; He says sadly.<br><br>&quot;Unless it was cool, which brings me to my main point,&quot; Mitchell interrupts happily.<br><br>&quot;&quot;Tattoos. Rock.&quot; Mason says bluntly. ‚ÄúAs long as you avoid the following idiotic designs, you&#39;ll be perfectly fine,&quot; He tells the audience as his own list unfolds, with &quot;Designs to avoid&quot;, written at the top.<br><br>&quot;Number 1: The barbed wire ring,&quot; Mason says. &quot;Nothing says &quot;1998&quot;, quite like a barbed wire ring around your biceps,&quot; he says. &quot;You&#39;ll look like a defensive lineman, and if you get one, you&#39;re probably as smart as one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Number 2: The Band Logo,&quot; at his words, the logos for bands like Metallica, Scorpions and Milli Vanilli show up to his left.<br><br>&quot;Any band logo&quot;, he says angrily. &quot;Think about it- The only pop star who remained cool for over ten years was Madonna. And you&#39;re not fooling anyone by getting a tattoo of her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Damn straight,&quot; Daniel cuts in.<br><br>&quot;Finally, and most importantly, is the tribal designs and the Asian Characters,&quot; Mitchell says.<br><br>At his word, your basic Asian character and tribal design show up.<br><br>&quot;No one gets it!&quot; Mitchell yells at the camera. &quot;And be honest- You don&#39;t either. Someone had to explain it to you, and you have no idea if they&#39;re even telling the truth. So,&quot; he says in summation, &quot;Avoid these simple pitfalls, and a tattoo can be a wonderful and rewarding experience. Minus the excruciating pain, and the needles, and did I mention the pain?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is at this time,&quot; Daniel butts in, &quot;That I&#39;d like to point out that our good friend Mitchell &quot;StoneMason&quot;, here, has a tattoo on his neck- In plain sight where we all have to look at it. It&#39;s from the movie Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, which is a fantastic movie (&quot;Pick it up now, it&#39;s dirt cheap!&quot; scrolls across the bottom of the screen as Daniel talks), right Mitchell?&quot; he asks him.<br><br>&quot;Actually, it&#39;s um, from the comic book,&quot; he says, clearly embarrassed.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s great- I&#39;m sure your boyfriend loves it,&quot; Daniel deadpans, already bored.<br><br>&quot;In closing,&quot; Mitchell says to the camera, &quot;Be sure to choose wisely when getting a tattoo. Don&#39;t repeat my mistake.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right, listen,&quot; Daniel says, dragging the camera over so it&#39;s looking at him. &quot;If, despite my points, you still want a tattoo, at least let me offer a good suggestion for a design. How about this: Why not get a tattoo of your favourite character, from your favourite online thing?&quot;<br>At this, Ben, &quot;Yatzhee&quot; Croshaw from game review service Zero Punctuation from online magazine The Escapist pops up in the corner. Daniel, finally noticing the things beside him (Which include Darth Vader, Bender from Futurama, and Cleveland Brown from Family Guy and The Cleveland Show.<br><br>&quot;I meant your other favourite online character,&quot; Daniel stresses, practically pointing at himself.<br><br>At this, Tyco and Gabe from Penny Arcade show up over Zero Punctuation. Daniel sighs heavily.<br><br>&quot;Okay Artie, you know what? Screw you and your-&quot;<br>Artie turns off the visuals, but we can still hear Daniel as though he is whispering, although it would look like he&#39;s insulting the people watching.

            <p>I know Neshomeh&#39;s already said her piece (not to mention that I&#39;m not actually a Permission Giver,) but this needs to be said. I apologize in advance if this comes off as confrontational or accusatory.<br><br>This story isn&#39;t an adaptation of the original Red vs. Blue skit; it&#39;s almost a straight copy-paste. There are only a few points/modifications that I can see where it&#39;s actually original writing. This is not an example of your own work, which is what the community wants to see from these permission requests - how well you can write. Not the Rooster Teeth guys, but YOU. This just feels lazy.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s plagiarism. Which is bad.<br><br>One final note regarding something from your character bios. Asexuality does not mean &quot;isn&#39;t looking for a relationship but still flirts with people.&quot; In broad terms, asexuals are individuals whom lack a sex drive and/or sexual attraction towards others. What you describe in Paul&#39;s bio under Sexual Orientation sounds closer to his being aromantic (that is, not interested in romantic relationships.)</p>

            <p>The whole plagiarism thing made me curious, so I pulled up Youtube and watched the original skit.<br><br>The only thing you did was convert the sketch to narrative text, change names and add the occasional jab at, for example, Justin Bieber (yes, you don&#39;t like him, we get it). Even a dozen disclaimers doesn&#39;t stop this from being incredibly unimaginative and flatout copypasted.<br><br>There&#39;s no original and creative work in transcribing a skit. The difference between most fanfic and what you did is that while others at least own their plot, you don&#39;t even have that. You posted someone else&#39;s plot under your name.<br><br><br>Now on to the writing: The transcribing shows. Is that it reads like a modified screenplay for the original PSA. Screenplays are not prose. They weren&#39;t made for being read, but for being acted out. I&#39;m not a PG either, but I think the PPC primarily looks for prose writers, not for people who transcribe videos and add their characters.</p>

            <p>In the generally accepted usage, plagiarism is taking someone else&#39;s work and passing it off as your own.

            <p>*emerges from the all-consuming awesomeness that is <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> to actually do stuff*<br><br>Erm. Like it says, concerns. Mainly, these:<br><br>1) This bit: &quot;Marikane often insults works he‚Äôs sporking in a dry tone, often skipping to scenes where there‚Äôs crime being done so he can get out of the badfic before his alcohol supply runs out&quot;;<br><br>and<br><br>2) the bits in the writing sample where people are insulted for thinking/liking one thing or another.<br><br>There are also miscellaneous mechanical issues, but I&#39;m far more worried that your missions will consist entirely of skipping ahead to the next scene and calling the characters‚Äîor worse, the authors‚Äî&quot;idiots&quot; if they happen to like barbed wire tattoos or Metallica or whatever else is arbitrarily not cool.<br><br>I am looking for evidence in your character bios and writing sample to indicate that my concerns are groundless, but I&#39;m not seeing anything. Your two agents have a lot in common when it comes to fandoms and such, you say, so I have no hope of one restraining the other when going overboard on matters of personal taste (which is one reason partners tend to be rather different, not the same). The writing sample is a bunch of dudes insulting each other and other people‚Äîand what it has to do with <i>Glee</i> I have no idea. Granted, I haven&#39;t seen that much of the show, but since it&#39;s spelled out that these characters are all your friends&#39; or your own OCs and there&#39;s no plot to speak of, I can only assume the tie-ins are references I missed, which don&#39;t really make it a fanfic. Oh, and this:<br><br>3) &quot;The Glee kids are doing... Whatever it is they do when I&#39;m not at the puppet strings.&quot;<br><br>Not only is that an in-text author&#39;s note in the second sentence of the story, which destroys any hope of a reader being drawn into it, that&#39;s a pretty off-handed dismissal of the canon this story is supposedly set in. Where from this writing sample am I to draw the conclusion that the PPC canon will fare any better in your missions?<br><br>So, those are pretty big concerns, and as such I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t grant you permission at this time. Going forward, please bear in mind that insults are not in themselves funny, and merely insulting bad writing is not what we&#39;re here to do. We&#39;re ideally lovers of canon and good writing first, mockers of ridiculous writing second, and never insulting just for the sake of being insulting.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;ll take it all on board. Just to note, I prefer Game of Thrones to the books.<br><br>The sample was based off something else, I was just adapting it from a Red Vs Blue PSA. I insist- it wouldn&#39;t be mindless insulting.<br><br>The &quot;Puppet strings&quot; thing was just making fun of the fourth wall. And not to sound disrespectful, but the Glee charatcers in Red Vs Blue makes more sense when using the actual episodes. And about RVB- it&#39;s a recurring thing me and a few authors reference during our fanfics.<br><br>And I can be a serious writer- it&#39;s just easy for me during comedy stories to kind of, pardon my language, dick around and be sarcastic at the characters.

            <p>Okay... Sorry to be an attention wh*re again, but after the reception my guilty-pleasure-more-Sue-than-I-thought got the last time, I wanna make sure this lot are HONED TO PERFECTION before I try for Permission. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Here&#39;s what I got so far.<br><br>Agent #1- Robert Vernet, formerly known as Sherlock Holmes<br>Appearance: Wild, shaggy brown hair, dark eyes, and a faint stubble across his chin. Facial expression can best be described as &#39;pensive&#39;, unless you&#39;re in the Harry Potter continuum, where &#39;thoughtful&#39; will have to do. Tends to have a meerschaum pipe clenched between his teeth, full of Longbottom Leaf. Tall and bony. Wears the black uniform of an average PPC agent, with a Floater flash patch on his right shoulder... and a dark brown deerstalker hat and a long blue scarf. If asked about these accoutrements, he simply laughs. <br>Personality: Brilliant, arrogant, and just a leetle too self-confident. Vain, when it comes to his mental capacities, and responds a little TOO well to flattery. He&#39;s originally from the Victorian era, and was originally one of the &#39;leading men&#39; in a piece of slash. He has a number of hang-ups related to this. Has a highly addictive personality, though his addictions tend to be to ward off boredom. Before coming to the PPC, he smoked like a chimney, drank too much, did cocaine and morphine, played World of Warcraft, and watched entirely too much bad daytime TV. Now, he doesn&#39;t really get bored, so he mostly restrains himself to the wide, WIDE array of bleeproducts available to agents. Doesn&#39;t make friends easily. A bit of a loner. Tries to be coolly logical, like his (original) namesake. Some days he is better at this than others. Has inherited his namesake&#39;s deductive skills, and tastes in most areas. Talks like a book, and never uses a one dollar word where a ten-dollar word would do. Oh, and his RC looks like it&#39;s a mess, but he&#39;s got an &#39;idiosyncratic&#39; <br>(read- completely batsh*t) system of keeping everything where it goes.<br>History: Robert comes from an Implausible Crossover RP- South Park/Sherlock Holmes. In this fic, instead of barely surviving his plunge from the Reichenbacher Falls, Holmes fell through a portal into South Park. General hilarity and some slash-y romance ensued. When the PPC came to clean things up, they found themselves with a problem, in the form of one Sherlock Holmes. In canon, Holmes is repeatedly stated to be rather sexless, and almost emotionless. However, while this Holmes was more than capable of emotion, and had fallen in love with a South Parkian, he wasn&#39;t a Gary Stu. He was like Paddlebrains- a legitimate, functional Character Replacement. Long story short, he decided to work with the PPC rather than die. His name&#39;s Robert in homage to Robert Downey Jr., and Vernet because he always liked the name. (It was a relative of his.) He&#39;s at the PPC for almost a year now, and has already driven two partners off (they couldn&#39;t handle his &#39;quirks&#39;.)<br>Lust Objects: John Watson and Irene Adler, from Sherlock Holmes; Christophe &#39;ze Mole&#39; DeLorne from South Park; L from Death Note; Charlie Epps from Numb3rs; River Tam from Firefly. <br>Fandoms: Anything remotely Sherlock Holmes related, Death Note, Numb3rs, South Park, Firefly, Ender&#39;s Game, and Lord of the Rings. He enjoys any canon that&#39;s big and complicated and has well-defined rules. He really loathes bad Holmes adaptations, and HATES Psych.<br><br>Right. Enough likes, and I&#39;ll post his partner.</p>

            <p>He looks good. I wonder how you&#39;ll manage writing a not!Holmes, however. One in the PPC will certainly be an interesting menace if- and you seem to suggest it- he is much like the canon he was intended to be.<br><br>That said, &quot;enough likes and I&#39;ll post his partner&quot; is bad. You either post them or not. You don&#39;t withhold for the hope of gaining attention or positive interest. That is a poor attitude, and withholding for attention is the realm of the bratty and those who feel they deserve special treatment. <br><br>Agents work in conjunction; while they may be singluar characters we also have to judge them with how they combine with their partner(s). One agent like this is interesting, PPC-wise. Two agents like this means you missed the mark, and so on. <br><br>Also, line breaks are your friend. Use them.<br><br>-July, onna phone</p>

            <p>He started out as being more or less Holmes... put it this way.

            <p>I thought I&#39;d elaborate on the whole &#39;enough likes and I&#39;ll post his partner&#39; thing, springing off of July&#39;s quote:<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t withhold for the hope of gaining attention or positive interest. That is a poor attitude, and withholding for attention is the realm of the bratty and those who feel they deserve special treatment.&quot;<br><br>It should be noted that this kind of attitude July mentioned is pretty much the impetus behind a Suethor tendency that comes up in some of the things we spork: some authors will say something to the effect of &#39;I&#39;m not going to continue this story unless you give me reviews&#39;. It&#39;s actually quite annoying when we see that, and I know I&#39;m not alone when I consider such things to be worthy of a charge in most PPC missions.</p>

            <p>Ok, so It&#39;s not a complete rewrite, but I have edited parts that July pointed out in her in her concrit of my previous permission request, which was very helpful, and thought I&#39;d let people take a look and see if the balance has been restored or not.<br><br>The permission request will come once I edit my piece for the hundredth time :p<br><br>Name: Percy<br>Age:17<br><br>Height: 6‚Äô4‚Äù<br><br>Species: Humanish<br><br>Home Continuum: Original story<br><br>Lust Objects: Master Chief, Tali (list ongoing)<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Fandoms: Spyro the Dragon, Halo, Mass Effect, AVP, <br>Adventure Time, MLP, Fallout, Elder Scrolls (so far)<br><br>Percy was a character from an original story that was scrapped in its early stages. In his home continuum, humans had decided that genetic manipulation was the next big social craze(right up there next to facebook and skinny jeans). Due to this, future generations were born with these traits, leading to the whole human race becoming not so human. With these changes came diseases, one of which affected Percy since he was born and would later be the catalyst in his unique appearance. He suffers from an advanced form of Bi-Polar disorder, dubbed Jekyll and Hyde syndrome in his homeverse, which affects the mental as well as the physical characteristics of the sufferer. Most sufferers do not live more than an average of 25 years, as the strain from the changes deteriorates their body and mind and leaves scars, and so Percy‚Äôs parents made use of a highly illegal attempt at a cure. In the process the features he sports today occurred, an unexpected reaction to the treatment. His condition is active, it is just stabilized, and In other words it won‚Äôt kill him. He is a relaxed and generally outgoing person and instead of getting angry, he just gets pitiful and whiny. Unless, he is pushed to breaking point. Slightly cowardly, he is still loyal to his friends.<br><br>He chooses to be purposely oblivious as he believes the world is far more exciting when you can‚Äôt see it coming. This has led to a few arguments with his partner and best friend, Vorce. He is also fairly intelligent in areas that he enjoys and is not stupid, even if he acts like it. He found his way to the PPC after his word world began collapsing around him, as he was the main character in the story, from a lack of storyline and plot. As the world collapses, Percy and Vorce began to argue over the best thing to do and as they argued, fell through a plothole. After stumbling through the multiverse and several badfics, they fell into HQ where they were initially separated until meeting once again at the office of the Marquis De Sod.<br>Name: Vorce<br><br>Age:17<br><br>Height: 5‚Äô6‚Äù<br><br>Species: Humanish/Bunnyboy<br><br>Home continuum: Original story<br><br>Lust Objects: Unknown<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Fandoms: Mass Effect, Discworld, JSRF, MLP, Oddworld(so far)<br><br>Vorce was a character in an original story that was created to be Percy‚Äôs friend. However, he was given very little personality beyond being grumpy or easily angered, this means he is constantly one of these two until his personality properly develops, he is slowly improving.  He met Percy when being attacked by a group of street punks. Percy accidentally wandered in without noticing and got beat up as well. This led to them helping each other back to Vorce‚Äôs place, where they became friends, Percy‚Äôs unique view on life capturing Vorce‚Äôs curiosity. They weren‚Äôt without their pitfalls however, when the story began to collapse, arguing broke out and things got physical, causing them to fall through a plothole. Adventures through the multiverse ensued.<br><br>He is a grumpy individual that is desperate for change in his personality. This leads to frustration when at people he cares about for no reason other than he can‚Äôt help it. He is a genuinely caring person, he just can‚Äôt show it. He also respects authority even if he doesn‚Äôt agree or like them, this won‚Äôt stop him from breaking rules if his friends are involved.  Some tension still resides between him and Percy around their argument leading to falling through a plothole, but neither will say what it was about. While still a steadfast friend, he sometimes questions if he is truly doing the right thing by standing by Percy. <br><br>Vorce is not one to hold back the truth, even when the <br>bluntness of his comments will hurt someone. He is very opinionated and will strongly defend what he believes in and cares about. This makes him a sort of double-edged blade, he will defend you vehemently, but might also curse you just as strongly. <br><br></p>

            <p>Whenever I see Gaspard&#39;s name, I always, <i>always</i> want to say <i>Gaspard de la nuit</i> after the trio of Ravel piano pieces. I&#39;m not sure why myself, but... there we have it.<br><br>So... concrit? Well...<br><br>This is <i>certainly</i> very different from a standard PPC mission. Of course, it <i>is</i> an intelligence report, so that would call for that situation.<br><br>I really like how it read as a journal-type thing of the Intelligence agent&#39;s thoughts on the fic as he goes through it. It&#39;s especially telling that you get a <i>ton</i> of personality oozing from the pages: you can just tell that the agent doesn&#39;t want to be there, and that snarking about it is the only way he can deal with it. I also like that the report reads like the narration of a film noir movie, since there&#39;s something dead-pan like about it.<br><br>I also like that you listed off things that were wrong with the fic at the end of the report, as well as listing characters off. That made much of it feel like a real report, in addition to being able to really get down and dirty with the fic in question.<br><br>If there&#39;s one thing I feel was lacking, it&#39;s that I felt a major lack of focus on the part of Gaspard himself, as well as the other characters. The brief blurb at the beginning of the report did a good job of establishing the scene, but I would&#39;ve liked to have them have more of a presence, if not during the report at least during the little introductory thing. I felt like the characters barely had any screen time for us to really get to know them all that well, and I think it made the report <i>too</i> depersonalized. I would&#39;ve liked to get more of a sense of Gaspard as a person before he enters the fic, and before the report begins.<br><br>But other than that, it was a <i>very</i> enjoyable read.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve enjoyed it!<br><br>I do agree with not giving Gaspard enough screen time, but I figured Intel reports were more like showcasing badfic that deserves to be sporked instead of the Agent him/herself.

            <p>I&#39;m currently in the middle of writing a trilogy which will cause a certain amount of upheaval in HQ. In order to make sure I do it right, I need a beta*. It needs to be someone who&#39;s been around a long time, and who has a good knowledge of PPC canon. A certain level of familiarity with my works wouldn&#39;t hurt either, since I&#39;m pulling in characters from all across the board. I&#39;ve got the first two stories completed, so I&#39;ll send those over as soon as someone volunteers for that.<br><br>For part 3 of the trilogy, I also need volunteers to co-write. At the end of part 2 the SO sends out a general message to the inhabitants of HQ, and I would like to see agents&#39; responses. This part <i>doesn&#39;t</i> require any particular knowledge, and is open to anyone with Permission. You can use agents from any department - I&#39;d like to see a wide range, actually - and that includes Infrastructure Departments. You can even use general-use NPCs (like Lux), or even Flowers. Everyone will see this, and everyone needs to respond. The response can be as long or short as you like - just a reaction shot, or an actual effort to do something about what the message says. You&#39;ll see ;)<br><br>If you&#39;re interested (please be interested) reply here with who you intend to write (so we don&#39;t get six people using the same character). I&#39;ll need a way to send you the Message, so please either leave your email, or email me at the address above. Oh, and when you write your scene, I&#39;d appreciate if you can find a beta for it, too. I&#39;m happy to do that for anyone who needs it (what with it being my project and all), but I would like every scene beta&#39;d.<br><br>... was that vague enough to attract interest? I do hope it was.<br><br>hS<br><br>*I know, right? When was the last time I asked for a beta? It would have been when I finally posted the account of the Fifth Anniversary Party, which was quite a while back.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been under the impression that we were in favor of the status remaining more quo than not, since the last time somebody shook it up certain repercussions were not widely appreciated. If it was anyone else proposing this, I imagine we&#39;d jump on it pretty quickly, so I feel obligated to at least raise a suspicious eyebrow here. If something is going to happen that will affect everybody, I&#39;m not sure mysterious is the right approach. More fun, maybe, but only if we like the surprise at the end.<br><br>That said, I&#39;ve never been able to resist a cameo, so I&#39;m in if I like it. {; P I&#39;d be writing for a fair bit of FicPsych, my DIC team, and my DMS team.

            <p>And I somehow knew you&#39;d be the one to raise it. :P<br><br>To face the first issue head-on: yes, there are a few deaths, but I deliberately made them people no one has thought about in a long time.<br><br>As to the Message: it will not affect anything you (or anybody else) writes unless you choose to. There&#39;s a neuralyser effect built in - unless specifically reminded of it, no character in the PPC will even remember the existence of the Message, let alone act on it.<br><br>However, there is also a method set up whereby the Message will randomly play when agents are given a mission - not every time, but every so often. If you don&#39;t like it, simply don&#39;t play it - you&#39;re the writer, you can do that. ;)<br><br>So I&#39;m not technically doing anything to the status quo. What I&#39;m doing is giving everyone else a way to do so, in a manner of speaking.

            <p>I read it, and it didn&#39;t horrify me that much, mostly, because it was so over-the-top that I never connected the characters names&#39; to the actual character. From there, it is only a really stupidly bad story. The real horror comes, I think, from connecting the names with characters that you know and love. &quot;They did WHAT to my beloved character?!?!&quot; <br><br>It was so over-the-top that it was not engaging enough to even make me see the characters as characters, even further removing any sense of horror I would have felt.<br><br>Now, one that really bothered me was a Sherlock Holmes that I sporked. It was written well-enough, about characters I liked enough, to /really/ get under my skin.</p>

            <p>Hello!<br>I&#39;ve been lurking here for some time and decided it was time to emerge from the tall grass and say hi. <br>I am a vaguely teenaged girl who was looking around TV Tropes one day and found your wiki. I then promptly read the original series and some of the other missions. <br>I mostly belong to Pokemon and other video game fandoms, though I have a great love for young adult literature. Video game fandoms are practically drowning in bad writing. I have more than enough examples of truly horrific stuff that has scarred me for life. Hopefully I can share and maybe spork some of them in the future.</p>

            <p>Oh, you should read Jim Butcher. He&#39;s done The Dresden FIles and Codex Alera, so if you like modern-fantasy or medieval (well, Roman) fantasy, he&#39;s got both covered, with a heavy coating of snark and humor in both.</p>

            <p>Vaati chiefly plays a role in stuff like Minish Cap and the Four Swords games. I&#39;m not sure what his role in the original Four Swords was, but I know that in Four Swords Adventures he was the main villain until Ganon hijacked the plot in the final dungeon. Minish Cap... I don&#39;t quite know everything since I never played Minish Cap, but from what I understand he was the central antagonist of that game too.</p>

I tend to dip in and out of fandoms, but the ones that I have stayed with constantly are Yu-Gi-Oh (even though I have only seen 3 series of it), Legend of Zelda, Dragon Age and the Shin Megami Tensei Series(or the Persona Series). I like slash (totally respect those that don&#39;t) and hate it when a slashfic is written poorly or the characters used in said fanfic are OOC. I am eager, curious to a fault and methodical.<br><br>I have read the constitution, but am at loss as to where to start. Can someone please help me?<br><br></p>

            <p>Hey. Newbie here. I personally think this is a cool concept, and thought I&#39;d just introduce myself before making intermittent appearances.<br><br>I&#39;ve never seen a Lord of the Rings movie. Never seen a Star Wars movie. Never read the Harry Potter books, though I&#39;ve seen most of the movies. Never read the Hunger Games books. Read the first Twilight book and said &quot;meh&quot;, then heard what people said about the rest of them and puked. My all-time favorite TV show is Phineas and Ferb, and I also like the Pixar movies, the Back to the Future trilogy, and everything ever written by Gordon Korman. I believe the Disney Channel hasn&#39;t made a good live-action show since Phil of the Future, though the more recent ones are at least watchable (except Jonas). I go by Qwizbo on FF.net, though I haven&#39;t written anything in a long time. Hope to change that. I enjoy reading fanfic, and hope that someday Tara Gilsebie will be more admired as a satirist than Jonathan Swift. I presently have no intention of writing PPC stories, but that of course is subject to change. And... that&#39;s about it. Happy lurking.</p>

            <p>For one, defining yourself in majority of the things you do not like and have not read rather than what things you do like and are interested in makes it difficult to approach you. You actively distance yourself that way. <br><br>Some people can be reading it as you being proud of avoiding things that are common and popular interests. That can also make it difficult to say anything. <br><br>Beyond that, waiting half an hour and then saying you&#39;re expecting hostility also doesn&#39;t really impress a favorable first impression of yourself upon others. As SeaTurtle just now noted- since this is a long reply I&#39;m writing- people are not paying attention to the board at all hours and minutes of the day. <br><br>Judging us as hostile before we&#39;ve even said anything, with a hostile attitude on your own part, again makes it less likely that people will comment or be inclined to comment. <br><br>No one likes to pet the dog that&#39;s barking angrily, so to speak.<br><br>Anyways, hi.</p>

            <p>Sorry. Two points:<br><br>First (and sorry if I get a bit overly serious - I&#39;m not usually very serious about anything), most people define themselves by the things they like, and a lot of people define other people by their opinions of things they like. For the most part, I said that because I don&#39;t want to be pestered by people asking for my opinion on something I can&#39;t form an opinion on.<br><br>Second, I had no experience with this forum before today, and most forums I hang around on move quicker.

            <p>I was thinking about this while rereading some old sporkings. Some books and movies are really, really awful; we all have our particular bete noirs, though <i>Twilight</i> seems to be the popular favorite. However, very few works are actively rotten through and through, and sometimes there&#39;s a character or two you just sort of want to . . . save.<br><br>For me, it&#39;s the Anita Blake character Edward. A professional assassin with a lot of experience and another life he keeps pretty tight-lipped about, Edward is actually much more interesting to me than Anita, who&#39;s gotten kind of--well, useless in the past few books. He has a cover identity as a good ol&#39; boy federal marshal, but wound up falling in love with a widow while in his undercover guise. Now Edward is torn about what he might wind up putting this woman (and her children) through, and actually has people to care about. A bit cheesy? Maybe. Hella more interesting than anything Anita gets up to? Definitely.<br><br>(I might have some unresolved Anita Blake issues.)<br><br>I can take or leave the entire rest of the series, but when it comes to Edward, I&#39;m dying to rescue him from the books and put him into a series where he&#39;ll be appreciated. It&#39;s actually painful to me to know that he&#39;s still in the books, because I&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll wind up joining Anita&#39;s harem.<br><br>So how about you guys? Anybody else have a character they&#39;d love to rescue from an otherwise objectionable work of fiction? Maybe a character you keep reading/watching for, even if the others are driving you nuts?</p>

            <p>Your mileage may vary in regards to the quality of the movie in question here, but I&#39;ll give it a shot anyway.<br><br>The entire cast of Nadesico: The Prince of Darkness. The movie was completely pointless, nothing any of the characters did actually mattered, and the final battle was an utter curbstomp. The entire cast had already shown that they could be good characters in the TV series, even if some didn&#39;t get as much development as they should have, and they still had some entertaining moments in the movie. However, there was no reason to bring them all together again apart from simple nostalgia, which wasn&#39;t enough to prevent it from being meaningless in the end. I don&#39;t know what went wrong between the show and the movie, but they deserved a much better sendoff than they got.<br><br>On that note, Lapis Lazuli, also from Prince of Darkness. I don&#39;t know who she is or where she came from or anything at all about her, other than that she has a ship apparently as powerful as the Nadesico and is probably from the same program that made Ruri the child genius that she is. There&#39;s just enough from her one appearance to raise plenty of questions, but all of them go unanswered. There might have been a sequel planned, but as it is, she is still a mystery wrapped in an enigma with a ribbon made of question marks, and will likely remain that way forever. Poor girl didn&#39;t even get a chance.</p>

            <p>I wanted to rescue a <i>lot</i> of characters from the <i>Nightside</i> books, just because the author has an unfortunate habit of coming up with something extremely cool/creepy and then killing them off in the next five pages. The Lamentation in particular comes to mind; it just seems like such a waste to make an abomination of that caliber and then just blow it up without it actually getting to <i>do</i> anything.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d have to say Davis Bloome from the latter Smallville seasons.

            <p>Not quite what you&#39;re talking about, but I never liked what happened to Stark&#39;s character in his later appearances in <i>Farscape</i>. I love the show to death, but it&#39;s like the writers forgot that his craziness when we first met him was an act, and he became sort of a stock lunatic to make bad decisions and mess things up (as if the crew of Moya needed help making bad decisions and getting into trouble‚Äîhah!). I was disappointed, and I would&#39;ve liked to give him a better deal. Also, I have a soft spot for dudes with only half a face. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>More on topic, Brom from <i>Eragon</i>. I don&#39;t remember much about the book and I never read the other ones, but I remember that he was interesting, and in the hands of a better writer his adventures would probably be pretty fun to read. And maybe Saphira, too. I understand she gets pretty well shafted by her rider, which is not cool. I know! Let&#39;s give Saphira to Brom instead of that dumb kid, what&#39;s his name, and let <i>them</i> be the main characters!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Alice from Twilight would be my first thought. I know, I know, people think she&#39;s just as annoying as Edward and Bella/ a Sue in her own right. But in the hands of a GOOD author (as opposed to Smeyer), the minor characters&#39; stories are actually INTERESTING. <br><br>Especially if you take the tack that getting turned into a vampire can&#39;t fix crazy. Then Alice is a BRILLIANT character. <br><br>She&#39;s been driven mad by a low-level psychic talent she can&#39;t control, and spent most of her adolescence in the nuthouse. She can see her future, and can sort of control it, but doesn&#39;t always have the good judgement to make the choices that will get her there. She is kind of manic, and makes really bad choices (e.g. stealing fast cars) on a regular basis. She&#39;s an incurable optimist, even though (Being a vampire) there&#39;s not much to be optimistic about. Oh, and she&#39;s in love with a guy who&#39;s a stone-cold killer, and doesn&#39;t understand why everyone else doesn&#39;t like him. <br><br>Maybe I&#39;m reading her character wrong, but that&#39;s how I saw her.</p>

            <p>One of my dreams is to write a mashup of Twilight and Vampire: The Masquerade, where the Twilight characters act according to the rules of the VtM verse. <br><br>This means that it&#39;d be kind of a badfic... According to VtM, there ARE no good vampires, there are just sympathetic ones and Complete Monsters. The trick is staying as human as you can, however you can. Problem is, with most of the Cullens&#39; (canon) weak, bitchy personalities, they&#39;d fall into the darkness pretty quickly.<br><br>I was thinking of doing it with Alice as the sympathetic, but batsheet insane, heroine, and the rest of the Cullens being truly nasty. Anyone up for co-writing?</p>
