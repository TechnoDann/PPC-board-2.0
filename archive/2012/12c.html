            <p>Classic Doctor Who huh? Interesting. Don&#39;t see many old Who fans, at least I don&#39;t see them.

            <p>(Sorry I didn&#39;t respond sooner.)<br>Voyager and TNG are my favorites, and while I say I like TNG best, Voyager&#39;s a really close second. The characters are so quirky and the situations they face are equally crazy. Got a favorite character? I like Seven, because she had such great development throughout, where each episode with her showed her getting closer to humanity and dealing with her Borg past. (Come to think of it, that&#39;s similar to the reason Data&#39;s my favorite on Next Generation).<br>Anyhow, hope to see you around!</p>

            <p>..the less cannon I realise I know. Oh well, I am not making fic at the moment, so I won&#39;t be ruining continuita. Still, I enjoied the mission. The fic did make me wonder though, what if there were two people worthy of the same peice of the triforce? Could it be split further? Who knows. Still, it seemed like the author was basing the &#39;birthmark&#39; after Twilight Princess rather than orcania of time. I dont know, perhaps not, perhaps the author just can&#39;t keep their cannon in check. <br><br>Again, good mission, I enjoyed it, but there was one thing I missed: why was Shiek offered life in the ppc, rather than being killed outright? I know he did not do much to break cannon, but I usualy like to see how oc&#39;s manage to worm their way out of death. If it does not matter, then fine. Just like to know.</p>

I feel that a writer&#39;s true skill lies in how he tells the story, not nesecarily his spelling. Because of this, and my... reduced care when writing on forums, you may see some more errors from me then you should on posts. That and I am naturaly slower at typing then I should, so I make an attempt at haste which is unnecessary, and causes me to mess up from time to time. Still, I do try, and if I screw up too bad, calmly point it out so I can see what I did and try to remember for the future.</p>

            <p>...so is the author&#39;s methods of communicating the story.<br><br>Don&#39;t feel rushed when writing forum posts: always give your one hundred percent when writing! Avoid writing things by ear (as a native French speaker, seeing anglophones trying to write in French by sounding out syllables is painful) since it is rather unreliable. Don&#39;t hesitate to use autocorrect to catch obvious mistakes, but apply careful judgement to words you feel iffy about. I sometimes have trouble with particular words when typing up stories so I open up a new tab on my browser and consult online dictionaries. <br><br>But most importantly: read! It helps you keep your language skills sharp and exposes you to new words.</p>

            <p>So... using my own badfic as an example for the intelligence report...<br><br>This is a Department of Intelligence Report for the story <a href="http://kit-the-wolfy.deviantart.com/gallery/41378683"><a href="http://kit-the-wolfy.deviantart.com/gallery/41378683">http://kit-the-wolfy.deviantart.com/gallery/41378683</a></a><br><br>PPC Intelligence Report<br><br>Fic: Yu-Gi-Oh: Reverse over ZERO (original version) (<a href="http://kit-the-wolfy.deviantart.com/gallery/41378683"><a href="http://kit-the-wolfy.deviantart.com/gallery/41378683">http://kit-the-wolfy.deviantart.com/gallery/41378683</a></a>)<br><br>Description: A VERY AU Yu-Gi-Oh story where Yugi Mutou and Seto Kaiba are dead. (Description is very basic)<br><br>Plot Holes: Many, many, many. Unresolved plots, beige prose, and a hefty dose of surrealism.<br><br>Problem Passages: WAY TOO MANY TO LIST<br><br>OC: (way, way too many, but protagonists listed) Leonidas McCloud, Leon Anderson, Lily Nora, Mia DuPar, Cyrus Lebarge, Clara Giuseppe, Kuma Tohru, James Noir, Haru Fulbright, Raymond Sleet<br><br>Type: Several are Mary-Sues, and some are bit characters.<br><br>Offenses Against Canon: It&#39;s an AU fic, uh... hm. Other than that... Mixing up magic systems improperly, injecting very inappropriate fetishes into the story (don&#39;t even ASK), spelling/grammar errors, Deus Ex Machina, idiotic writing, pissing off its own creator (yours truly), beige prose, Mary-Sue-ism, inept crossovers, stupid lines, switching between different moods inappropriately, random Author&#39;s Notes, etc.<br><br>Additional Comments: EXTREMELY BIZARRE/SURREAL. Handle with caution.<br><br>Like that?</p>

            <p>My favorite episode from season three would have to be Magic Duel, and I am not even a Trixie fan! It killed my fic idea, but done so much better then I ever could. It was a Once Upon a Time and MLP crossover with Trixie as Regina. Now the Trixie Twilight feud is over with, and in such an awesome way, where I don&#39;t even care about my lost opportunity. <br><br>On a second note, should we have a brony rollcall? Just so we know who has been infected with the pony bug. Obviously me, you, Kitty, and the newbie Basil are, but I dont know who else is infected.</p>

            <p>My favorite so far was Wonderbolt Academy. I like Rainbow Dahs getting compared to a similar pony whose desire to push herself went too far.<br><br>Also, I feel as though the Trixie-Twilight feud resolved kind of lazily. I mean, Trixie literally didn&#39;t show any signs of having learned her lesson until the random fireworks display at the end. I was a bit disappointed.</p>

            <p>After reading the first chapter, I can say, it is defanately fixable. The grammar aint bad, and the spelling as far as I can tell is fine. Here is the problem I see at the moment: description is lacking and the author is too involved in the story. Author&#39;s notes are slapped in the middle of the fic without any warning or true reason to exist other then sene changes. As for description, I have no idea who anyone looks like. Which, in hindsight is hilarious, seeing as characters are usualy rife with urple prose. I desided that mia has blue hair. Cuz you gotta have blue hair!<br><br>While I do not know Yu-gi-oh, and have only read the first chapter, it seems to need a story coach rather than a sporking. Still, I am sure these grammar natzis will find some things to work with. Plus, if you want it to be sporked, then who am I to juge.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply! Trust me, you have to read pretty far in the story to get to the bad parts. So Mia has blue hair now? I see. Better get a picture of her up on dA, then.<br><br><br>And believe me, the story doesn&#39;t just get bad. It gets insane. VERY insane. Kids willingly turning into Duel Monsters-level insane.

            <p>Actually, this is more of a &quot;watch&quot; -- I was checking on a suspect fic in the Parasol Protectorate section of the Pit, and decided for some reason to click on &quot;Crossovers&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Soulless Junction&quot;, Kamen Rider + Parasol Protectorate <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8330318/1/SOULLESS-JUNCTION"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8330318/1/SOULLESS-JUNCTION">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8330318/1/SOULLESS-JUNCTION</a></a><br><br>&quot;Trial 1shot; X-over of Den-O and Soulless.

Alexia Terrabotti must now don the mantle of a Kamen Rider in order to protect her timeline from the Imagin... with help from a red Imagin ... Powerful!Alexia, no pairings yet.&quot;<br><br>I can&#39;t judge the Kamen Rider part (and the author admits up front s/he&#39;s working from the manga adaptation of &quot;Soulless&quot;, not the book), but a mini in the author&#39;s summary isn&#39;t a good sign.<br><br>I also spotted this one in Movies:<br><br>&quot;Up, Up, and Away&quot;, Avengers <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8824887/1/Up-Up-and-Away"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8824887/1/Up-Up-and-Away">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8824887/1/Up-Up-and-Away</a></a><br><br>&quot;A cocky entrepreneur, a demigod who doesn&#39;t really know his way around, a man with breathtaking anger-management issues, and a couple of master assassins assemble to defend the Earth.

            <p>Many of us have probably seen the T.V. show <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. Well, apparently, there&#39;s quite a bit of Suefic in it. And the Sues go after Sheldon. Yes, Sheldon Cooper. Here are two examples, but there&#39;s much more:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711064/1/LoveHate-Relationship"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711064/1/LoveHate-Relationship">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711064/1/LoveHate-Relationship</a></a> -Nikki is energetic, hyper, loving, and loud. Sheldon is...Sheldon. Two people so different couldn&#39;t possibly get along...but could they? R&amp;R please! Sheldon/OC (Sue outsmarts Sheldon about fandom related stuff. Need I say more?)<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7496698/1/The-Cousin-Configuration"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7496698/1/The-Cousin-Configuration">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7496698/1/The-Cousin-Configuration</a></a> -Howard&#39;s cousin, Ellie, returns to Pasadena when she accepts a job at Caltech.The gang is impressed by her obvious intelligence and the way she can put Sheldon in his place.However,Sheldon can&#39;t place this weird feeling he has when he&#39;s around her.SC/OC (Howard&#39;s cousin is attractive? And Sheldon ditches Amy for her? I don&#39;t think so...)<br><br>And, of course, if you want to read any more, type &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; into the search bar on the Circle of Lemmings. Make sure you bring lemming repellent and Bleeprin.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t seen the movie yet, but my school did the musical, so I have a general idea of the plot and setting.<br>And that general idea makes me think that while Les Mis is an excellent story, you do <i>not</i> want to visit it. I mean, I almost understand Tolkienverse Sues. Rivendell is my ideal vacation spot. But why would want to go to a historical time period full of bloodshed and suffering?

            <p>(Since my username is fandom specific, it doesn&#39;t create a mini-Boarder.)<br><br>I <i>am</i> ticked off. I mean, for a PPCer, I&#39;m actually rather forgiving of Sues, because it&#39;s kind of my fantasy too, to go visit my favorite fictional location. That is, if it&#39;s a continuum that would be <i>nice</i> to visit. But I just don&#39;t understand self-inserts into continua that are hostile. I can understand wanting to go to Hogwarts and study magic. I can understand wanting to help John and Sherlock solve a case. But I do <i>not</i> understand wanting to throw yourself into the middle of a bloody time in history or into the arms of a serial killer. *end rant*<br><br>I think anything made from Sues would taste sickly sweet and leave sparkles on your teeth.</p>

            <p><i>Eat my dust, Valve.<br><br>The third installment of <s>the only</s> everyone&#39;s favourite DoI series is back with an episode to cap off the year! Want to re-read previous episodes? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-DB404M-C1J_Qhtptg_HYAwfwajC7iLonVlBaxzZW8k"> You can find them right here.</a><br><br>The usual disclaimers apply: the PPC belongs to Jay and Acacia,</i> Portal <i>to Valve Corporation, the</i> Rainbow Factory <i>to Aurora Dawn, and World One to itself. Officer Rooney belongs to Lily Winterwood.<br><br>I&#39;d like to thank Desdendelle and the Irish Samurai for their excellent beta-reading services.<br><br>Concrit is welcome, as always!<br></i><br><p><b>Episode 3</b></p>
<br><br>There comes a time in every agent’s life when they must brave the maze-like corridors of HQ and make their way to a seldom-used place. This strange pilgrimage could take place once a month, once a week, or even once a day for the more neurotic agents. The causes of this trip were varied: some cited personal reasons, some were forced by their partners (usually the aforementioned neurotic types), and some had simply gotten lost. Either way, agents made their way to this room at least once during their time in Headquarters. It was like death and taxes: the more you waited before succumbing to them, the more your life turned into a living hell.<br><br>Some called it a chore. Some called it a waste of their time.<br><br>For Agents MacFarlane, San Lorenzo and Chang, however, it was simply laundry day.<br><br>The trio hauled mesh bags filled with dirty laundry down the Hall of Many Different Obstructive Potted Plants, ducking under overgrown foliage and swatting away branches and vines that hung down from the ceiling. Penny Chang, a short Chinese girl with black hair, led the way.<br><br>“Okay, I’m sure the entrance to the laundry room is somewhere around here,” she said, checking a door half-hidden by a cactus. “Last time, there were two big rose bushes around the door... guys?”<br><br>Luisa and Angus were too busy discussing the subtle yet steady increase in the DoI’s popularity to answer Penny.<br><br>“Yeah, and I heard a story told by a pair of Assassins that actually acknowledged the fact that we took care of some of their paperwork beforehand,” said Angus. “You remember the Factory, right? The one that scared the living daylights out of Gaspard for a week? Yeah, it’s dead and the DoI was mentioned! Maybe we’re crawling out of the hole of anonymity.”<br><br>“Meh. It’s going to take a lot more time before us Spies get more credit for our work,” replied the Argentinian woman as she brushed a strand of long curly black hair out of her eyes. “But you’re right, Tubbs, it’s getting better.”<br><br>Angus recoiled as if he had been stung. “Tubbs? That was seven months ago! Good grief, are you still sore about that steak? Okay, so maybe I do keep on nabbing your food just for kicks-- you should really see your face--  but I said I was sorry, Luisa! Or should I say, Entwife...”<br><br>“Hey, I thought we agreed to never talk about this again,” hissed Luisa, her face turning an interesting shade of vermilion as she rounded on her coworker. She raised a finger and poked Angus in his rather ample chest. “If you ever mention it again, I will--”<br><br>Penny was suddenly between the bickering pair and separated the two before they tried to strangle each other. “Hey, hey! C’mon guys, can’t we all just give it up? The laundry room is right there, so can you just please give it a rest?”<br><br>The frenemies separated with a few grumbles and a few half-hearted insults (“Go back to Middle-earth, Entwife.” “Plug your pie hole with more cake, Tubbs.”) and followed Penny through a doorway half-hidden behind massive leaves. The laundry room stretched out in front of them, with a high domed ceiling dominating innumerable rows of washing machines that filled the area with a soft thrumming noise. A large marble basin near the door bubbled quietly, water gently flowing down carved grooves into drainpipes. The washing machines were arranged more or less by order of size and function (this one washes your clothes! This one washes your shoes! This one stains your clothes black!) in haphazard rows around the basin. A complex network of pipes protruded from behind the machines, literally tying the entire room together with hundreds of metres of contorted piping that rose into the air, tangled themselves, then sunk into the tiled floor.<br><br>Angus squinted and recognized a nearby figure as Officer Rooney, a recent DoI recruit. The blond man turned to his friends. “Hey, I’ll just go and see Rooney for a couple of minutes, okay? I didn’t get the chance to actually talk to him after that great big pillow fight. I’ll catch up later,” he said and hobbled under the weight of his laundry over to the former police officer.<br><br>Penny smiled and waved while Luisa simply shrugged and followed a faded spray-painted line on the floor labeled “This way to the good machines!” The pair trudged past various machines, various agents, various agents beating up machines because their clothes had been stained urple when they had their backs turned until the spray-painted line ended in front of several tired-looking washer-dryer units in a completely deserted corner of the room.<br><br>As Luisa piled her clothes into the machine and Penny hunted down a box of detergent, the Argentinian Spy heard someone nearby muttering things about the Flowers. She looked behind the washing machine and found a young woman with red hair and bright yellow clothing scribbling something down on a sheet of paper with a blue wax crayon. A stack of crudely folded pamphlets bearing titles such as “REPENT” and “YOU SERVE AN IMPOSTOR” sat next to her.<br><br>“Hey, you! What are you doing back there?” said Luisa, gesturing at the woman. “Would you mind not squashing the pipes? I’m trying to wash-- ack!”<br><br>The woman had sprung from her nook and grabbed Luisa’s shirt collar in one hand. The redhead hung there, feet not touching the ground as Luisa straightened herself and tried to pry her off. “Agent! What is your name?” the woman asked.<br><br>“Gerroff me!”<br><br>“Good, Gertrude. Listen to me, as this is important,” said the redhead as she somehow managed to stay anchored around Luisa’s neck. “The Sunflower Official is dead and the one that is currently sitting in his flowerpot is an impostor and--”<br><br>“SOMEONE GET THIS OFF OF ME!” yelled Luisa. She saw Penny rounding a corner out of the corner of her eyes. “Penny! Help me get rid of her!”<br><br>The Chinese agent dropped the box of detergent she was carrying. “Nonono! Don’t let go of her, she’s the Sunflower’s Witness! FicPsych wants her! Stay right there, I’ll get help!” she yelled as she ran back towards the exit.<br><br>Luisa sighed, wrapped her arms around the Witness, and dragged her towards the nearest oversized front-loading washing machine. Once there, she opened the door with her foot and stuffed her cargo inside. She half-closed the door behind her, leaving it open a fraction of a centimetre. The Witness tried to push against the door but Luisa leaned against it with the small of her back.<br><br>“So, you’re wanted by FicPsych, eh? What for?” asked Luisa, straightening her collar and smoothing the creases in her shirt. “No, wait, you were saying something about the Sunflower Official, is that it?”<br><br>“He’s a fake! I have concrete evidence that he has been replaced by an impostor who seeks to overthrow the rest of the PPC. You can read all about it here,” said the Sunflower’s Witness, pushing a pamphlet through the narrow opening between the door and the washing machine. “Everyone should repent and join me in the revolution against the usurper!”<br><br>Luisa took the pamphlet and looked through the crayon illustrations-- some of them flaky due to the Sunflower’s Witness having pushed down so hard when drawing-- and said, “Gee, don’t you think that the other Flowers would have noticed by now? They’re kinda like telepaths or something. Heck, the Sub Rosa’s the head of my department and she knows pretty much everything that goes on in HQ. I don’t think she would have missed something that big, yeah?”<br><br>A sigh and a “You don’t understand because you’re blinded,” wafted from the belly of the machine. “Ah! I’ve never seen the Intel patch before. It’s very nice. Almost as nice as the DMS one, actually.”<br><br>Luisa’s right hand flew to the Velcro pad on her left sleeve. No patch. She crouched and peered into the washing machine’s glass door. “What do you think you’re doing? Give me back my flash patch!”<br><br>“It’s a bargaining chip. As are these,” the Sunflower’s Witness said, pulling Luisa’s wallet, wrist watch, and keys out of her pockets. “You let me out of here and I give you back your stuff.”<br><br>The Spy was taken aback for a few seconds, then snorted with laughter. “Ha! Do you honestly think I’m that stupid? No, I’ll just let FicPsych pick you up and grab my stuff later.”<br><br>“Be that way then,” said the Sunflower’s Witness, closing the door and slamming the inside of the washing machine with a fist. It rumbled to life and began to vibrate ominously.<br><br>Luisa, was rooted to the spot for several seconds, mouth agape. She then threw open the washing machine door and thrust her hand inside, groping at... nothing? The agent heard something clank behind her. Luisa spun around just in time to see the Sunflower’s Witness crawl out of a nearby drying machine. She gave a squeak of surprise and bolted down the row with Luisa in hot pursuit.<br><br>“No traps can contain me!” yelled the redhead. The Sunflower’s Witness dived into another washing machine and started it up before Luisa could catch up. When the Spy reached the machine, the Witness was gone just like before. The Argentinian woman stopped and listened for any noise that might betray the madwoman’s movements. A clanging noise came from her left and Luisa rushed towards it, sprinting down rows and vaulting over agents and their laundry baskets.<br><br>“You-are-not-getting-away!” panted Luisa, punctuating each word with a step. Even if the Witness was using machines to warp around the room, Luisa was still gaining on her quarry. After a few close calls, the Witness hung a sharp right and wiggled into the narrow space between two drying machines. Luisa, unable to follow, let out a grunt of frustration and leaned in front of a washer-dryer unit to catch her breath.<br><br>Two seconds passed before the dryer door suddenly exploded outwards at head-height, braining Luisa and knocking her to the ground. The dazed agent watched as the Sunflower’s Witness clambered out of the dryer and dropped to the floor. The redhead gave a gasp of surprise when she saw the Spy feebly stirring on the Generic tiles and dropped to her knees.<br><br>“I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to--” she started but took notice of the agents that were starting to crowd around the pair. “I’m sorry!” said the Witness with a final glance downwards as she darted towards what appeared to be the path of least resistance.<br><br>She expected it to be a short run to the unguarded exit. She didn’t expect to be tackled by eighty kilograms of overweight Spy. The Witness recovered spectacularly though, disentangling herself from Angus’ grip as soon as she hit the ground and rolling away from the agent. She sped past Penny and a FicPsych worker who had just arrived on the scene and escaped into the maze-like corridors of HQ.  <br><br>As Penny and the Nurse wheeled around to chase the Witness, Angus kneeled beside Luisa. “Wait, try not to move your head,” said Angus. “You’ve just suffered a nasty blow to the noggin and there’s the possibility that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage.” <br><br>From her position on the floor, Luisa groaned and raised a hand to her brow. “Ugh. I know enough about first aid to help myself, Tubbs. And I thought Yakov was the only one who dropped random references to whatsits when he talks. Don’t you dare start.”<br><br>“Good. Just checking to see if you’re still with us,” said Angus. He paused and looked towards the spot where the Witness had been moments before. “Still, that was a pretty sweet tackle, huh? And just look at that: I knocked the change right out of her pockets! There’s a wallet, some keys, a flash patch, crayons and drawings, and look! There’s even her watch!”<br><br>Luisa cracked a grin and looked at Angus. “Hey Tubbs? I think we’re even now.”<br><br>- - - - - <br><br><i>Coming soon<sup>TM</sup> in 2013: Gaspard&#39;s fourth Intelligence Report, a DIA spinoff featuring Taldaris and Fire Flash, and the return of Agent Harris Frost!</i></p>

            <p>For those of you who don&#39;t know, Cards Against Humanity is basically <a href="http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/">the most offensive version of Apples to Apples in the history of ever</a>.<br>(That&#39;s why it&#39;s bloody hilarious.)<br><br>I&#39;m now super curious about what a PPC version of the CAH game would look like.

Would it have something like:<br><br>Black Card:<br>When the DMSE&amp;R cut open the Mary Sue they found...<br><br>White Cards:<br>A Dalek.<br>Bad End.<br>Agent Lux.<br>Soufflйs.<br><br>that?<br>Ideas? I may use it as an opening or something in a mission later.</p>

            <p>Nope. Never played the game before. So, naturally, I&#39;m not the best voice for the survival of this idea.<br><br>Of course, since it seems to follow my kind of humor (nonsensical), I think I could find my groove regardless.</p>

            <p>For the first time in, like, two years. Mainly inspired by the thread Riese started on the 20th and the discovery that almost almost all of what I wrote in 2010 is bad. So, lo and behold, my first-ever Phineas and Ferb fanfiction:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8849754/1/Spy-Story"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8849754/1/Spy-Story">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8849754/1/Spy-Story</a></a><br><br>Now, I should point out that I am ninety percent sure that it&#39;s no good, or that if it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s going to be. But I&#39;m still going to write, for this reason: I have written things that suck, I know this, and I am okay with this. Therefore, I have no reason not to write besides pesky real life.<br><br>Yay.</p>

            <p>Just before they die, they transfer their <i>katra</i> (soul) into another person via mind-meld. Then all you have to do is rehabilitate their body and do another mind-meld, preferably supervised by a Vulcan high priestess.<br>Of course, if you can&#39;t rehabilitate their body, it&#39;s not going to work. So they can die, but depending on the Vulcan it might not be so easy.<br>(Star Trek factoid of the day brought to you by the only Boarder with a fandom-specific username.)</p>

            <p>First of all, well done coming here to ask for help! The first step in learning to write better is having the courage to see where improvement is needed! :D<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve only read through the second chapter so far (did you mean to link to chapter two?), but I can already see a few SPaG (spelling, punctuation, and grammar) problems, especially in this section:<br><br><i>The only thing going through the old castle in the middle of the dark forest was a cool breeze and a few sounds of birds flying through the old enclaves where they had built their nests and homes away from the animals in the forest around them. <b>Though a new addition which they gave it no attention</b>, they had no reason to look at the strange creature which had<b> appeared with a shine and another larger one like it.</b></i><br><br>To start, the bolded snippets are worded awkwardly. For the first one, it almost seems as though you missed a word or two. A better way to write that part might be, &quot;There was, however, a new addition to the formerly barren castle, to which the birds paid no attention...&quot; That way, your readers understand that the castle isn&#39;t the new addition all the birds are ignoring.<br><br>The second bit simply has a few words that can perhaps be replaced with more accurate terms, like this: &quot;...appeared with a flash of light and had initially been accompanied by another, larger creature like it.&quot; This doesn&#39;t necessarily clear anything up - that part was already pretty clear - but it does make the sentence flow more smoothly. Additionally, since the larger creature (Discord, yes?) is not with the smaller one, perhaps something should be added to let the readers know Discord is no longer in the castle?<br><br>Secondly, your sentences are a bit long and need some more punctuation to indicate changes in subject or &#39;focus&#39;; that is to say, if your sentence is a scenery, every time your reader &#39;looks&#39; at something else, there should be punctuation. For instance, with just a bit of re-wording, you could write the first sentence something like this:<br><br><i>The old castle that sat in the middle of the dark forest was nearly deserted; at first, the only things within were a cool breeze and the sounds of birds flying through the old enclaves where they had built their homes, away from the animals in the forest around them.</i><br><br>By breaking the sentence up somewhat like that, you give the reader&#39;s &#39;eyes&#39; time to see everything - or, more literally, you give their mind time to process the image you&#39;re trying to create for them. Remember, writing is a visual art as vivid as painting or sculpting; if your reader can&#39;t visualize what you&#39;re trying to tell them about, they aren&#39;t likely to enjoy your work.<br><br><i>One pebble from the ceiling had been finally pushed from its perch on the oldest timber high over head by a small bird which grabbed a bug from under it dropping the small marble sized stone onto the head of the strange creature. It hit it in the center of the forehead making it groan scaring a mouse away from it making it get up.</i><br><br>Again, you need commas and semi-colons; otherwise, your sentences just seem like long, rambling strings of words! You don&#39;t even need to re-word your first sentence, or even your second one, really:<br><br><i>One pebble from the ceiling had been finally pushed from its perch on the oldest timber high over head by a small bird as it grabbed a bug from under it, in the process dropping the small marble-sized stone onto the head of the strange creature. It hit it in the center of the forehead, making it groan. The sudden sound frightened a nearby mouse, and the small creature skittered into the shadows as the creature sat up.</i><br><br>Another thing I&#39;ve noticed is that you tend to use a lot of adverbs and adjectives, especially at the start of your second paragraph: <i>One pebble from the ceiling had been finally pushed from its perch on the <b>oldest</b> timber high over head by a small bird which grabbed a bug from under it dropping the <b>small </b>marble sized stone onto the head of the strange creature.</i><br><br>Now, I only bolded the two that, in that sentence, are relatively unnecessary. We don&#39;t really need to know the timber the pebble was on also happened to be the oldest timber there, and saying that something is &#39;small&#39; and &#39;marble-sized&#39; is a bit redundant; even shooter marbles are considered pretty small, so most readers won&#39;t see a boulder if you simply call something &#39;marble-sized&#39;.<br><br>Description is a wonderful thing to have - it can help you &#39;paint&#39; a magnificent picture in the minds of your readers - but, as with paint and carving, overusing descriptive words can make the story drag unnecessarily, and takes away what I think is one of the most beautiful aspects of literature: the ability of the readers to fill in a few details for themselves.<br><br>While too little description can give your readers nothing to imagine (which results in very bland writing), too much strips them of their imagination, which not only makes the story feel as though it is desperate to impress people, but also causes the reader to feel penned-in and unable to enjoy the story. It can give your writing a sense that everyone in it knows exactly what&#39;s going on, and that you as a writer are unwilling to accept new ideas from reviewers or to allow your readers to &#39;help&#39; you paint your story - or rather, to add enough of their own imaginations to what they&#39;re reading to make the story and characters resonate with them (if that makes any sense.)<br><br>That&#39;s all I can think of technically; as for MLP:FiM, I think I can help with character interactions. Now, if I&#39;m not mistaken, the pony Jake stumbled across was Fluttershy, wasn&#39;t it? Since I&#39;ve only read the second chapter, I&#39;m not sure what changes you&#39;ve made other than Jake showing up, but if this is following Discord&#39;s victory in the Canterlot palace maze, Fluttershy should canonically act like a bully at this point in the fi...il Twilight reunited her friends (and thus the Elements of Harmony), Fluttershy did not stammer and she (very importantly) did not treat anyone <i>kindly</i>. Additionally, if she has <i>not</i> been Discorded in this story, she should still recognize Jake as a Draconequus and react with fear rather than open friendliness. Angel has the right idea by attacking him!<br><br>I promise I&#39;ll read the rest of the story when I can, and hopefully I can give you a more detailed run-down of how to improve your story. :D<br><br>-- KittyNoodles is going to start signing her posts now, &#39;kay everyone?</p>

            <p>Agent Vania paused <i>Epic Mickey</i> after a knock sounded at the door—an oddly metallic knock, considering the door itself was fashioned from Generic Surface.  She passed Doc, who was reading some murder mystery on the bunk bed, and opened the door.<br><br>“would you like some candy” the . . . person . . . standing at the door said.  They wore a sickeningly brownish-pink suit and bore an oddly blank, staring expression.  They were short and stooped, and had a head covered in brown hair that looked almost like yarn.  “i have candy”<br><br>“Uh . . .”<br><br>“Is it that Sunflower’s Witness again?” called Doc.  “Tell her to stop interrupting Canon Research Time™.”<br><br>“It’s definitely not the Witness,” Vania said.  “What kind of candy are you selling?”<br><br>“i have free candy little boy”<br><br>“Whoa, now!  I usually leave the literary quotes to Doc, but I—”<br><br>“NO LIVING MAN AM I!” Doc interjected, standing up in bed.<br><br>“. . . Right.  Well, I’m certainly not a boy, at any rate.  I’m beginning to suspect you’re not a legit candy man.  Do you mix it with love and make the world taste good?”<br><br>The odd person’s eyes seemed to bug out a moment.  “running Friendship Protocol v2.1”  The mouth turned up in a smile for just a brief moment, then settled back into emotionlessness.  “i am little boy like you”<br><br>“Doc?  Did you agree to let Chris Hansen set up a sting in our RC and forget to tell me?”<br><br>“No . . .”  Doc finally got down from the bed and joined Vania at the door.  “Who is this?”<br><br>“i am little boy like you . . . both”<br><br>“God damn it!  Seriously?” Vania shouted.  “Are you a badly described parody clone of Professor Oak?  Look!”  She started lifting up her shirt, but Doc blocked her arms.<br><br>“Wait!  Do you smell hot dogs, Vania?”<br><br>She sniffed.  “The air does seem a bit . . . meaty, doesn’t it?”<br><br>“there is only free smell of free candy”<br><br>“♪Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam♪”<br><br>Behind the odd person, six Vikings marched through the hallway, swinging their broad arms back and forth with elbows crooked as they sang.<br><br>“♪Lovely spam, wonderful spam!  Spam, spam, spam, spam . . .♪”<br><br>The singing faded away as the Vikings moved further down the hall.<br><br>“this is coincidence”<br><br>Vania batted her eyelashes.  “Doc, please bring me my pen.”<br><br>“You want a pen?”<br><br>“I want my BIG, WOODEN PEN, Doc.”<br><br>“Oh!  Of course.”<br><br>As Doc retreated back into his RC to find Vania’s baseball bat, the odd person’s eyes bulged out again.  “yes free candy for boys just go to double-u double-u double-u dot dot dot dot dot . . .”<br><br>Vania’s bat had interrupted the individual’s speech by way of decapitation.  The standing torso’s neck oozed pinkish meat while the wire-filled head stuttered on the floor.  “. . . dot dot candy free candy frandy frandy—”  The head was interrupted a second time by its body toppling backwards and crushing it.<br><br>“It was a—”<br><br>“I figured it out from context, Vania.”<br><br>“Let’s just be thankful it’s gone now,” Vania said.<br><br>“And hopefully, it’s an isolated incident,” Doc replied.<br><br>A metallic clanging echoed into their RC.

            <p>So, I go to a secondary school that has a tremendous amount of freedom for what students can do with their education, including peer taughts, where students can teach a class on any subject, with a teacher serving as a guide and support. The curriculum is created by the student, homework assigned by the student, and graded by the student. With peer-taught, there are two options for when to teach: a class period during the regular school year, or during intensives. Incentives are up to ten day, all day long classes that do not follow traditional class subjects, such as international travel for history/social studies credit (I got to go to Greece last intensive!), fractals and vectoring as art or math credit, and others.<br><br>    I want to do a peer-taught intensive on Analyzing Fandoms, where students would look at different fandoms of various media, and look at not only what they are fans of, but what the fans create. We would look at fan art, projects, fanfic (that’s partially where you come in), and other aspects of fans, in hopes of gleaning more about society and psychology.<br><br> Here’s where you come in: I want to look at multiple fandoms, and the materials they are fans of, and I need material, including fandoms and fan works. As much as I would love to have fans of literary works, due to time difficulties, I don&#39;t think I can. Unfortunately, this means no LoTR, Hunger Games, or Twilight *shudder*. This means I am likely sticking to movies or TV shows to show to the students. I can show those in one day and have the students look at what people are fans of, why they are fans of it, and what the fans have made, all in reasonable time so I can move on to the next fandom. I am going to have: <br>Star Trek, the largest and most famous fandom,<br>Star Wars, the second largest/most famous fandom, as well as the rival of Star Trek, so I can look at fandom rivalry too<br>My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, because I’m biased. Well, that and I know the workings of the Brony fandom really well, and can go on and on about how fascinating they are sociologically.<br>I would have Doctor Who as well, but I feel bad about having three science fiction fandoms, and one cartoon, so I probably wont have it. This also rules out Firefly (probably, if you give a good enough argument for why I should I might include it) and other science fiction fandoms.<br><br>   I think I can have five fandoms, with two days per fandom, mostly as buffers, and if we have time extra, to do a final project on a particular fandom either not covered in the class, or more in-depth on one we did cover. Whatever we do, it needs to be informative and FUN. Having learning while having fun is the entire point of incentives.<br><br>    I need you to give me material on the fandoms, as well as two other fandoms to teach. A large fan site, something like Equestria Daily; where everything in the fandom is a few clicks away, would be the best, but links to fan celebrities is fine too. Most importantly for you though, I need fanfic, good fanfic, that shows how good it can be. Popularity is not too important, but length is; seeing as I want high school students to read it, I cannot have a monstrous fic that rivals War and Peace for length. A short to medium sized fic, that is reasonable to read in about five hours at most would be best, and if it is an extraordinarily popular one as well, all the better.<br><br> Do this, and I will probably show the students the PPC, showing members of all fandoms coming together with one singular goal: to kill bad fan fiction, and promote good writing. I will probably ask for more help later on, once I get closer to actually creating the curriculum, but I want to start compiling information now.<br><br>Thank you guys for any help you can give, I am truly appreciative of it.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the recomendations, and I will defanately take warhammer 40K under consideration, though it would be interesting to see the student&#39;s faces when they see me walk in with a huge box full of painted figurenes, set peices and books. &quot;Class, this is the next fandom we are going to look at.

            <p>Also, I think you should probably bring in the Sherlock Holmes fandom - not just for the modern adaptations, but also the original - there&#39;ll be plenty of movie/TV show fodder, and the Holmesians are one of the oldest fandoms with some of the most illustrious members (come on, what other fandom has freaking Franklin Delano Roosevelt in it?).</p>

            <p>When Nichelle Nichols (Lt. Uhura) wanted to leave Star Trek, Martin Luther King told her that Star Trek was one of the few shows he allowed his kids to watch because it portrayed a black woman (Uhura) in a position of power. Needless to say, she stayed on.<br>And let&#39;s not forget Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space, whose childhood idol was Lt. Uhura. Or Whoopi Goldberg, who, also inspired by Uhura, went on to get a role on Next Generation. <br>So yeah. Star Trek for the win!</p>

            <p>Also, I believe most of modern fandom came from Trek - I mean, Holmes may be one of the oldest fandoms, but it wasn&#39;t a modern fandom and most fanfiction in those days were called &#39;pastiches&#39; and were published.<br><br>We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Trek for putting a name to the Mary Sue after all ;D</p>

            <p>Lt. Mary Sue was clearly a parody. :&#39;D However, if you want us to tackle the Sues that existed before there was the label of Mary Sue to brand them with... well, we&#39;d have to find ourselves an old fanzine, for starters.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s try to keep in mind that we don&#39;t actually &#39;need&#39; to do any of this - the fandom does not, in this or probably any other reality, actually change the multiverse on a drastic level.

            <p>I suppose. I sorta meant more that it doesn&#39;t matter if nobody ever makes fun of Suefics - because, as you said, the words don&#39;t actually break the canon. The canon is also just a set of words, really.<br><br>I don&#39;t know that the PPC is really even making sure people don&#39;t think badly of fandoms. Honestly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re really here for any serious purpose whatsoever - the number of people who come into contact with fanfiction, contrasted against the number of people who come into contact with us... well, let&#39;s just say it&#39;s probably fair depressing, if we&#39;re honestly trying to make an impact on overall perception of fandom.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;ve always seen the missions, the MSTs, the sporking, and everything else as a way to make each other, and ourselves, laugh at things that might otherwise make us furious or horrified. I think, for me at least, the PPC&#39;s always been more about hanging out with like-minded friends than making any real change to the fandom.<br><br>(That&#39;s why it makes me twitch when the overall response to badfic is &quot;KILL THE EVIL BEAST RAAARGH HULK SMASH PUNY SUE,&quot; or the response to missions is &quot;Good job, that REALLY needed to be killed!&quot; Because... it didn&#39;t. It could&#39;ve gone on existing forever with none of us being the wiser. And that&#39;s okay! I don&#39;t actually <i>want</i> the responsibility of fandomhood on my shoulders.)<br><br>...and I&#39;ll stop dragging the thread down with lectures now.</p>

            <p>if it wasn&#39;t for the PPC, I&#39;d still be out there writing badfic. I&#39;d recently received a review that said:<br><i>I absolutely LOVED this. And can I just admit something real quick? I knew fanfiction existed (I am honestly kind of new to this whole scene, so, forgive me xD) but I did not know it would so.. well written? So. Kudos all around, on everything. I am glad this was the first fanfic I read!</i><br><br>To me, the PPC simultaneously helps me laugh and let loose at badfic and improve my own writing.

            <p>All right, here is my actual response to your post. I&#39;ve been busy, with sporadic Internet access, so I wanted to wait until I had some time to sit down and really come up with my ideas. It&#39;s probably overkill, but I&#39;m splitting this into two parts--the canon and the fandom.<br><br><i><b>Star Trek Canon 101</b></i><br>There are five television series and eleven (twelve in May) movies that are part of Star Trek, as well as games and novels. The series are, in order of air date: <i>Star Trek</i> (called The Original Series, abbreviated TOS), <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> (TNG), <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i> (DS9), <i>Star Trek: Voyager</i> (usually just Voyager, but sometimes VOY), and <i>Star Trek: Enterprise</i> (usually just Enterprise, but sometimes ENT). The first six movies deal with TOS, the seventh is a canon crossover of TOS and TNG, the next three are TNG and the eleventh is the reboot movie that came out in 2009.<br>The Trekverse is a hypothetical future, where Earth is united and part of the United Federation of Planets, an organization dedicated to peace between all its members. Its military/exploratory organization is called Starfleet, and most major characters are officers in Starfleet. The series focus on Starfleet ships and in DS9&#39;s case, space station. The Trekverse is populated with a wide range of aliens, the most famous of which are the stoic and highly logical Vulcans. There are horrific and mind-boggling sci-fi dangers, but overall, Star Trek is a positive view of the future. Just look at the words of the opening of TNG:<br><i>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise, its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.</i><br>A brief overview of each series:<br>TOS: The famous one with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock, its premise was simply a ship exploring space. It created modern fandom, despite running for only three seasons with an incredibly limited budget.<br>TNG: Like TOS, it focused on the adventures of an Enterprise, only a hundred years later, so the ship is actually the Enterprise-D. The second most famous, it introduced recurring Star Trek concepts such as the Borg and Q. Its captain, Jean-Luc Picard, has contributed his facepalm to Internet memes, and created the split among Trekkies of Kirk vs. Picard. It ran for seven seasons.<br>DS9: Set aboard a space station instead of a starship, it had a long, overarching storyline and more focus on emotional relationships than any other series. Consequently, fans are split, with some loving it and some hating it. The only Star Trek series with a black captain. It ran for seven seasons.<br>Voyager: Focuses on the adventures of the starship Voyager when it is thrown 70,000 light-years from Federation space and has to make the supposedly 70-year journey home (though, like TNG and DS9, it ran for seven seasons). It was the only series with a female captain, Kathryn Janeway. Also famous for Seven of Nine, a character that somehow managed to be drop-dead gorgeous <i>and</i> an interesting, well-rounded character. Voyager also, curiously enough, has the most fanfiction on fanfiction.net of all the Star Trek series.<br>Enterprise: Set chronologically before TOS, it details the voyages of the first ship called Enterprise, which is exploring the galaxy with literally no idea what&#39;s out there. It only ran for four seasons, and, like DS9, the fandom is split on its quality.<br><br>Fandom coming tomorrow!<br><br><br></p>

            <p>I thought it would be a good idea amoungst you guys. Good to know some people would take it, even if they are not in my school.

            <p>I suggest looking at ACD, Granada, RDJ, BBC, and CBS - ACD&#39;s the originals, of course, and Granada&#39;s the closest you&#39;ll get to ACD in a television series. RDJ is more action-movie oriented, BBC is more cerebral, and CBS is like if Sherlock Holmes was a police procedural.<br><br>Also, if you have time, check out the Great Mouse Detective, either in book form by Eve Titus or the Disney film.

            <p>However, there are some where it&#39;s a case of your kink is not my kink, and there is one Sherlock/LotR fanfic they reviewed where they claimed the author knew their Tolkien stuff when said author was using Grelvish (it was, for me, a good fi...il the elves started speaking Grelvish, and I will admit that was what got me to write my own Rings/Sherlock crossover because I could not read any more of that).<br><br>They generally give lower grades to the ones that fall under the YKINMK category though.</p>

            <p>The greatest success (and curse if you are the wrong type of person) of the school is the idea of &quot;Responsible Freedom,&quot; that students are not mindless sniveling morons that need to be hand-held to do anything. Want to skip class? Sure, go ahead, BUT, be ready for the consequences of those actions later. That is the strongest part of our mentality, on the whole: Do as you feel you need to do, but be ready to accept the downfalls thereof. If you want to be jealous more later, the school&#39;s name is Steller Secondary. Google it, read the by-laws, and see why Steller is best school.<br><br>As for MLP:FiM, I know all the important fan-sites, even some non fan sites. Other than Fanfic, I know what I am doing with that particular fandom, so don&#39;t worry about that. I need material from the other fandoms, because I don&#39;t know them too well. Is there a large fan site for Star Wars that focuses on fan works, or do you lot know fan works I can reference for the other fandoms.<br><br>Oh. Anime. Well, I suppose they SHOULD be represented, sheesh, now I feel bad. Still, I&#39;m not the biggest fan of anime, but they are a HUGE fandom in their own right. OK, I think it&#39;s going to be an anime series of some kind, probably Naruto, but feel free to suggest others. Oh, though the co-teacher LOVES ThunderCats, new and old, so perhaps that should be it... Go ahead and suggest other series, I got to think.</p>

The only problem with Let&#39;s Play&#39;s is that most of them have the player talking through most of what they are doing, which while fine on it&#39;s own, but is not the best for teaching about a video game to those who know nothing about it. If you happen to know a seres that is just a guy playing the game silently, that would actually open up video games, but otherwise... I have to think...</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read your missions and intermediary... things before I ever introduced myself. How is Firebrand doing stuck in a small dorm while his owner is off killing Mary Sues?

If I could show a video game, that would round up the five nicely, and warcraft has such an... interesting fandom at times.

            <p>Um, kitty. Black Friday has been over for a while...<br><br>No, dont tell me he&#39;s going to LEAVE! That would be beyond sad, but if pulled off right, could be a truly pivotal moment in your series. Then again, how boring can it be when you got a miniture being of Chaos? Still, if Firebrand leaves, I imagine Veralin will develop a taste for rosted Sunflower seads, if you catch my drift. Jumper may well join her.<br>(You know Jumper is just a stand in right? I&#39;m not actualy going to be named Jumper right? Right?)<br>Of corse. Still, my point is, the SO needs to watch himself.<br><br>Well, take your time, when you read it is when you read it. Just remember: it is an AU fic, and hold jugement untill about five or six chapters. I dont want you to dismiss it too soon, though I can see where you would not be a fan. It is defiantly not for everyone.<br><br>Pfft, Northrend. Totaly did everything in that oversized glacier. Totaly.<br>(What are you talking about, you dont even HAVE WoW, forget slaying Arthas.)<br>Shush you!<br>(Never.)<br><br>Thanks for all the videos though, they are defanantely a help. If I do deside to use Warcraft, WoW or the RTS games, I&#39;ll be sure to let you know. As it is, I have plenty of other fandoms to look at.<br>(So many interesting fandoms, so little time.)<br>Preaching to the choir man. <br><br>Thanks for the help.

            <p>I know, but I&#39;ve been doing so much Christmas shopping this year that it feels like Black Friday never ended! (Plus, I was born and raised in a city of 25,000 people and now live in a city of well over 50,000. Light traffic down here is rush-hour traffic on a school day up in Ukiah!)<br><br>Well... That&#39;s where I <i>think</i> things are headed - though, you&#39;re right, with Flutteryshy around things are never too boring! But that&#39;s why I&#39;m waiting until Caroline and Veralyn have completed a few more missions; my hope is that I&#39;ll either stumble upon a better idea than, &quot;later, pal,&quot; or I&#39;ll give myself an idea while writing something totally unrelated. At the moment, though, Firebrand may be looking at a parting of ways - and that makes me sad.<br><br>Although, no matter what I decide, I feel quite certain that Firebrand won&#39;t be <i>ordered</i> away by any of the Flowers That Be. <i>If</i> he does have to leave, I think it will be because Veralyn finally realizes he&#39;s better off in an environment where he isn&#39;t stuck hours or even days at a time waiting around in an RC while she gallivants about through the different continua and fights Sues and other canonemies with a human instead of him.<br><br>Which will make me cry.<br><br>Er, you do realize Northrend has some rather un-icy parts, too, yes? I mean, the Sholazar Basin is basically a tropical jungle...<br>(Ah, I see I&#39;m not the only one who argues with my OCs! Yay~!)<br><br>Yesh, I notice a couple of fandoms up there. Oh well - if you use it and need anything, just ask! (I also know of a bunch of fanfictions and some fanart - I&#39;m not obsessed at <i>all.</i>)</p>

I think I saw that Miss Cam posted a few pages back, pretty sure she was here before me. hS is at least almost as old as I am. In terms of joining the board, I mean. In real life he&#39;s two years older than me. Which means he&#39;s an olllllld man.<br><br>I joined the board in the summer or early fall of 2002. So yep, ten years. Good gracious. :S</p>

            <p>In terms of appearance, the board is exactly the same. In terms of who&#39;s posting, I recognize hardly any of the names now; but I haven&#39;t been on here in probably 5 or 6 years at least, so that&#39;s only to be expected. Not sure about anything else... it&#39;s been a long time since I frequented the board, and I haven&#39;t read through many of the messages since I found it again. In terms of when I first started posting, though, the board was a lot smaller... I want to say there were maybe 10-14 regular posters? But within a couple of years it had grown a lot.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad the end of the world didn&#39;t stop you from going for Permission. *g* And may I say that I look forward to seeing that fic sporked. I glanced at it just to see what fandom it was, and then the level of sheer nonsense kept me reading. &quot;Emerald&quot; is short for &quot;Esmeralda&quot;? She and Draco and Blaise—or is it Blaze?—<i>Zam</i>bini are reincarnations of some sort? What? {X D I love how she mysteriously has nothing against Muggles and Muggleborns despite being raised by the Malfoys from the tender age of one. And how most of chapter five is word for word from the book.<br><br>Anyway! The agents and writing sample look pretty good, though you (and your betas) need to keep an eye on your end-dialogue punctuation. There are several commas that should be periods and vice versa. Here follow several examples with their corrections below:<br><br>* “Hmm,” the man looked thoughtful.<br><br>** &quot;Hmm.&quot; The man looked thoughtful. [You can&#39;t speak a thoughtful look, or &quot;hmm&quot; one, either.]<br><br>* “Fine.” he sighed.<br><br>** &quot;Fine,&quot; he sighed. -OR- &quot;Fine.&quot; He sighed. [Either he said &quot;Fine&quot; on a heavy exhale, or he said &quot;Fine&quot; and then sighed.]<br><br>* “Okay by me.” She replied and she pushed him through the portal.<br><br>** &quot;Okay by me,&quot; she replied, and she pushed him through the portal. -OR- &quot;Okay by me,&quot; she replied, then pushed him through the portal. [The second is less redundant and flows better, IMO.]<br><br>* “Guess what!” the woman grinned at Will, giving him an uneasy feeling.<br><br>** &quot;Guess what!&quot; The woman grinned at Will, giving him an uneasy feeling. [You can&#39;t speak a grin.]<br><br>* “You get to go see the Marquis de Sod!” she grabbed Will’s robe and pushed him out the door, slamming it behind him.<br><br>** &quot;You get to go see the Marquis de Sod!&quot; She grabbed Will&#39;s robe and pushed him out the door, slamming it behind him. [You can&#39;t speak a grab, either.]<br><br>* “Well, that’s not normal.” Will said to himself.<br><br>** &quot;Well, that&#39;s not normal,&quot; Will said to himself. [You <i>can</i> speak to yourself.]<br><br>* “I was brought here on the threat of death, then sent to find a Marquis after being locked out and denied directions.” Will replied in a defensive tone.<br><br>** &quot;I was brought here on the threat of death, then sent to find a Marquis after being locked out and denied directions,&quot; Will replied in a defensive tone. [You can also speak a reply.]<br><br>* <i>Get lost.</i> It replied, and Will stalked out the doorway, slamming the door behind him.<br><br>** <i>Get lost,</i> it replied, and Will stalked out the doorway, slamming the door behind him. [See previous note.]<br><br>If there&#39;s anything you don&#39;t understand, let me know and I&#39;ll try to explain better. {= )<br><br>Also, one more thing:<br><br>* “Not a clue. Can you help me find the Marquis?” There was another almost-sigh from the flower.<br>    <i>I am the Marquis de Sod, head of the Department of Personnel. From the agents’ behavior as well as your own, I can see that you are a new recruit. Name?</i><br><br>There&#39;s no reason not to put the flower&#39;s action (the sigh) with the flower&#39;s dialogue here. It&#39;s a new sentence, so putting it on the next line with the matching dialogue wouldn&#39;t disrupt anything. I seem to be in the minority with my opinion that people should stick to their own paragraphs generally, but that doesn&#39;t mean breaking up people&#39;s dialogue and actions willy-nilly is a good idea. {= P<br><br>Aside from that, nothing really jumps out at me as a problem. Heartfelt thanks for using paragraph indentations, though, since you aren&#39;t using double-breaks between paragraphs. It&#39;s nice to know the indent isn&#39;t a lost art. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hey, all! I&#39;m Litany. Several of you may remember me from several months ago. I found you guys through my TVtropes addiction, went through a star-eyed idolization phase, settled into a routine of regular posting, and then disappeared. <br><br>Most of the blame for my inactivity rests with me. I had a bunch of hemophilia-related medical issues sneak up on me, and I signed up for a curriculum of classes that was a LOT more rigorous than I expected.<br><br>However, I also felt that there wasn&#39;t much here to do here as a newbie. When I asked what a new poster could do to integrate him/herself on the board, I was invariably told to read the original series (which I had read several times over at this point) or to browse the wiki (more or less at random). I occasionally would contribute to PPC-related discussions/RPs, but I didn&#39;t feel experienced enough a member to participate comfortably. <br><br>To be clear, none of this is intended as attack on the Board. I understand that you&#39;re busy people, and each of you almost certainly has something better to do with your time than hold the hand of a prospective newbie who might not even last a week. <br><br>Instead, I&#39;m here to ask how I can improve. My semester just wrapped up for Christmas break, and my hemophilia issues have more or less resolved themselves. I want to start writing here again, but I don&#39;t want to repeat the mistakes of my last attempt. So what can I do to get myself settled on the boards?<br><br>Thanks in advance for the suggestions.<br><br>-Litany</p>

            <p>Hmmm... got a fandom that you don&#39;t see discussed around here much? Make a random plug for it. I&#39;ve noticed that I tend to be fans of books and series that don&#39;t have a lot of activity on the board in general because they aren&#39;t prone to fanfiction. For example, I love A Wizard of Earthsea and Witch World, which don&#39;t exactly get a large amount of attention on the internet. (For which I&#39;m kind of secretly grateful because I never want to know what the shippers would do in either of those universes.)<br><br>Other than that, I guess... just general discussion stuff? I haven&#39;t been here too long, and I show up when I can, so I might not be the best person to ask. Also, *Hugs* because I know what it&#39;s like to have medical issues and a crazy course schedule. Hemophilia sounds scary. :(</p>

            <p>Ouch, hemophilia? Not fun - although I&#39;m glad you&#39;re in better health again!<br><br>I know what you mean about feeling too new to interact - when I first started here a few months back, I felt like a third-grader trying to fit in with high school students! I figured the best way to get past that was to read everything PPC-related I could find and participate in conversations that dealt with subjects I already knew something about (at least to start with). That way, I was able to figure out the many personalities here and learn about the PPC at the same time.<br><br>And, of course, I probably annoyed people with how often I used.to post links to badfics I&#39;d found - that was before I realized <i>anyone</i> can edit the Unclaimed Badfics page on the Wiki!</p>

            <p>First, welcome back! I&#39;m glad to hear your health has stabilized.<br><br>Like the others said, you weren&#39;t doing anything wrong, but pretty much the only way to integrate anywhere, not just here, is to get involved with discussions and games and whatever else is going on at a given time. That&#39;s how we get to know each other. {= )<br><br>Jumping in head-first can be scary, though, so to get a sense of how things work on the Board, I recommend reading stuff on the Board. Read everything. Read posts you wouldn&#39;t normally think of reading, because you never know what might come up as the thread goes on. We are incredibly prone to tangents and silliness around here.<br><br>I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s pretty much all there is to it, though: reading and writing. If you didn&#39;t come here expecting to do lots of both, especially the first, that&#39;s the bit you&#39;ll have to work on to improve. You&#39;ll never catch on to how we do things if you don&#39;t observe others interacting for yourself, and since that pretty much all happens in text, the only way to observe is to read.<br><br>Also, speaking for the wiki, there are less-than-random ways to go about learning over there. For instance, if you read the main page, you&#39;ll find many particularly handy links listed. For another thing, there&#39;s a blue menu bar across the top of the wiki, where there are more handy links. Some of them are the same ones, and you can assume those are important, and some aren&#39;t, but those are good to know, too.<br><br>When you feel ready, a great way to start interacting would be to leave reviews of new missions for their authors. Being new doesn&#39;t make your opinion of a story any less valid, and constructive feedback is always gratifying for the author. Plus, we all like talking about our characters, so commenting about them is a good way to strike up a discussion with someone new. {; )<br><br>I hope that helps.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I remember when I first joined, it was a bit intimidating for me too. I had been a lurker, and I returned to lurking for a bit until some discussions started that I felt I could participate in. Don&#39;t feel like veteran boarders won&#39;t value your opinion. They will. And you don&#39;t have to post on every thread, just where you can contribute, as I&#39;m sure you can.<br>I&#39;m speaking as a relative newbie myself--I only joined a few months ago.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been wondering for a bit if this would be a suitable permissions piece, given that I&#39;m profoundly unhappy with the way my planned permissions piece is shaping up. It&#39;s not in the usual vein of the PPC - in fact, it&#39;s more of a psychological horror story - but I am proud of it as much as I&#39;m scared of it. It has been beta&#39;d, but it&#39;s in what is, for me, a slightly experimental style, so my feelings are mixed.<br><br>Anyone want to pop over and tell me if it&#39;s too long, too scary or whatever else comes to mind? Thanks.<br><br>Oh, yeah, and there are warnings here. It&#39;s not graphic but parts of the story are probably a potential trigger, because it&#39;s insane and stalky.</p>

            <p>At least on what you&#39;ve said about it, it sounds workable - the biggest questions in a permission giver&#39;s mind are if you can write good characters, and if you can write well in general. As long as that&#39;s relatively visible, the genre shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br><br>There have been multiple requests where we&#39;ve asked for more, too - it&#39;s not a &quot;we will fail you if we don&#39;t see exactly what we want&quot; thing.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know anything about the two fandoms involved and I think you did a good job of showing what was wrong in this fic, while at the same time recognising that some parts of the canons are a bit silly.<br><br>If I might offer some concrit, though, I thought that the mission lost some momentum during the card duels. A lot of it was someone using a non-canonical card or using a card in the wrong way and the agents complaining about and saying how it was supposed to work. I felt that some of it could have been abridged. Alternately, I would have liked to see more actual effects and jokes from the non-canonical cards, like with &#39;Rose in Bloom&#39;, which I thought was great!<br><br>The agent banter was funny and well written and chocolate-intoxicated Riaa was a nice surprise.

            <p>[12/21/2012: 12:01 AM]<br><br>Elise rubbed her eyes as the clock next to her bed flicked to the new day. &quot;Well, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not dead. Darn. Guess the Apocalypse got cancelled,&quot; she muttered. Internally, she debated whether it was worth leaving her room to get a snack. With a groan and a muttered appreciation for the vacation starting tomorrow, uh, today, she plodded out of her room and downstairs to the kitchen, taking care not to wake up her parents. She quietly walked over to the refrigerator, and stopped dead.<br><br>Standing on top of the kitchen table stood a - thing. It looked like a plushie on whatever the adorable version of steroids were, with the creative design of a six-year-old. It looked cute and cuddly and had bows on its rabbit ears. It had also somehow transformed the rather-worn kitchen table into a, well, cute version. The tabletop shone like gold (was it shedding sparkles?), a pristine doily-esque tablecloth lay on top, and sparkly ribbons dotted the edges. With a tiny squeak, the creature jumped off the table, walking towards Elise, and where it stepped, the floor turned into pink-tinted marble.<br><br>Elise may have been half-asleep, but she wasn&#39;t really sure if she wanted to be touched by that thing - heck, she wasn&#39;t really sure if she was even awake. She slowly walked over to the cutlery drawers, keeping an eye on the approaching thing. When she reached in, the thing sped up, the marble spreading out from its footsteps, extending out to begin touching the drawers (immediately they began to look like an old-timey tea cabinet, or at least Elise&#39;s Disney-inspired ideas of what tea cabinets looked like). Elise yelped, yanking out a steak knife and throwing it at the thing.<br><br>Of course, her experience with throwing knives was limited to tossing them in drawers. The steak knife clattered onto the marble, and the thing picked it up with its little stub-paws. Immediately it changed, the metal becoming white and shiny, the hilt changing to pink, with little gold curly bits and pink bows. Elise still thought it looked uncomfortably sharp as the thing began to speed up, waving the blade at her. <br><br>Elise grabbed a pair of cooking knives, trying to stare down the thing as it approached. With a tiny, squeaky yell, it jumped at her, leaping in front of her face. Elise bit back a yell as it suddenly rushed to six inches in front of her eyes, swinging wildly at it with the knives. She didn&#39;t even hit it very hard, but the thing had less mass than a pillow and went slamming against the opposite wall... which promptly began to turn a happy pink. Elise grimaced, readjusting her hold on the knives, before trying to run-without-actually-running over to the fallen plush. It looked up, apparently still winded, but before it could try and move she slammed her foot down on it.<br><br>When her slipper changed from a worn, once-purple piece of cloth to a fluffy pink bunny-shaped one, she realized her mistake, backing up to tear it off her foot. The apparently still dizzied creature leaped, but it was slower than before, and Elise swung her knife at it, impaling it onto the wall, where it seemed to begin deflating, a thin stream of glittery pink liquid leaking out from it.<br><br>When it seemed dead enough, Elise yanked her knife out of the wall, trying to rub the blood off on her shirt (and staining it with pink, unfortunately.) She sighed as the adrenaline that&#39;d been keeping her from falling asleep began to wear off, and she realized what she&#39;d been doing. &quot;This is either the weirdest dream ever, or I&#39;ve gone and snapped,&quot; she muttered, looking for a chair, when the floor under her began to move. It seemed to twist, almost, and before she even realized what was happening, Elise fell through, her knives miraculously not landing on her as she landed on the floor of some new area. &quot;What the...&quot; she muttered.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br><i> So, with all the apocalypse stuff going around, I figure we could do an Apocalyptic RPG. Of course, as you&#39;ve probably gathered, it&#39;s not really a normal one - the Apocalypse of Cuteness. CAFs of various kinds have begun invading, transforming all they touch into a maelstrom of cloying cuteness. Our characters (not PPC Agents, though they could be counterparts to them) are gathered by an entity/organization opposed to the invasion, and must defend the world from the oncoming cute by any means necessary - mad science, our character&#39;s cuteness, large guns, superpowers, what-have-you. And remember to have fun! </i></p>

            <p>Caroline&#39;s eyes fluttered open reluctantly as an odd scratching at her bedroom door dragged her away from a spectacular dream about giant chocolate bunnies. Grumbling, the sleep-deprived teenager rolled onto her belly, dropping her arm over the edge of the bed to snatch her cell phone from the floor (she briefly considered adding a nightstand to her Christmas list, only to remember a beat later that having one would only add to the clutter in her room). After turning it on and letting her eyes adjust to the sudden light, she glanced at the time on the phone&#39;s display and tossed it back onto the floor with a groan.<br><br>For a moment she wondered what her pets could possibly want so early in the morning - her cell phone was rather clearly displaying the time as being 12:02 AM. Then, with a sigh, the teenager hauled herself up, slipped her slippers on (the only downside she could see to having all hardwood floors was that they got so bloody <i>cold</i> in the winter), and finally went to open her bedroom door.<br><br>As she did, she was greeted by a high-pitched, incredibly cute-sounding chirp. Surprised - cats didn&#39;t make <i>quite </i>that sound - Caroline looked down to see what looked like a Furby come to life. The thing was bright yellow with a white tummy and an orange beak and feet. It stared up at Caroline with large, blue eyes and chirped again, flapping its little wings like a happy, newly-hatched penguin chick.<br><br>&quot;That... &#39;s friggin&#39; adorable,&quot; Caroline mumbled, still not entirely sure if she was awake.<br><br>The little Furby thing chirped again and waddled towards her, flapping its stubby little wings as though it wanted a hug. Caroline reached down to pick it up - and noticed just in time that the little fuzzy thing had turned her hardwood floors into ultra-plush, Pepto-pink carpeting wherever its feet touched the floor.<br><br>&quot;Ho, hey, hang on, little fella,&quot; Caroline said, backing away again. &quot;Yer spreadin&#39; the cute around a bit, there. You contagious or somethin&#39;?&quot;<br><br>The Furby chirped again and began waddling faster, blinking rapidly as Caroline nearly fell rump-over-heels over a half-unpacked box of books.<br><br>&quot;I really need to unpack the rest of my stuff,&quot; Caroline grumbled as she staggered around behind her bed. The Furby thing was still coming, turning everything it touched cute. Her sleeping bag (which needed to be rolled up and put away)? Pink and white, with gold princess-y writing all over it. Her cell phone? Hot pink with white and black hearts everywhere. Her necklaces, all silver chains with (she thought) medieval-y designed pendants? Gold chains dripping with cutesy doggy, kitty, lovey charms.<br><br>&quot;Go away, you little freaky cute thing!&quot; Caroline snapped. &quot;Quit make my stuff cute! I mean,&quot; she added, backing up again as it crawled across the bed towards her, &quot;I like cute things, but I&#39;m more a swords-and-shining-knights kinda girl, you know?&quot;<br><br>the Furby thing chirped again and picked up part of a curtain rod from the floor near Caroline&#39;s feet (seriously, <i>why</i> hadn&#39;t she unpacked and stowed everything yet?) As the stunned teenager watched, the curtain rod turned sparkling white; the end of the rod became a fluffy pink cotton ball, and dripped with gold and white ribbon and strings of red, heart-shaped beads.<br><br>&quot;Oh, great,&quot; Caroline grumbled, &quot;And now you&#39;re armed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yah,&quot; the Furby chirped, waving its baton threateningly.<br><br>Caroline waited a second longer; just as the Furby pulled back to take a swing at her with the baton, she dove across her bed, landed in a heap on the (thankfully) now-plushy floor, and them scrambled out of her bedroom and slammed the door shut.<br><br>&quot;That little jerk turned my door pink!&quot; Caroline snapped. &quot;Oh, Im&#39;ma make me cutie stew...&quot;<br><br>Something grabbed the door handle from inside the room and started trying to force the door open. Figuring she was better off getting armed than waiting out the adorable abomination, Caroline turned and bolted for the garage, hoping she could get to the gun safe before she was cutiefied.<br><br>Behind her, the Furby thing had thrown the door open and waddled menacingly out into the house, swinging its baton like a miniature, adorable law enforcement officer of evil as it began a methodical search for its victim.<br><br>It had searched - and cutiefied - two bedrooms and a bathroom, and had begun to do the same with a third bedroom when--<br><br>*KBLAM*<br><br>Caroline squeaked and jumped back, her rifle still aimed at the hot pink pile of glitter and stained yellow feathers that was all that remained of the adorable little terror.<br><br>&quot;Cuteness explodes?&quot; Caroline muttered to herself after a moment. &quot;Guess that kinda makes sense...&quot;<br><br>At that moment, something grabbed the back of Caroline&#39;s nightshirt, and she was dragged, screaming, bedraggled, and still clutching her rifle, through what should have been the linen closet in her hallway.<br><br>She landed with a thump on a different floor in a room that most <i>certainly</i> did not exist in her house. Still clutching her gun - though being careful to keep the barrel pointed up to the ceiling - she slowly stood up and took a disbelieving look around.<br><br>&quot;What the hell...?&quot; she wondered, blinking rapidly as though she&#39;d been smacked between the eyes.</p>

            <p>Elise cursed as something or someone slammed into the floor (if that was what it was) next to her. She grabbed at her knives, squinting through her glasses at the new arrival - and, with a bit more trepidation, at the new arrival&#39;s rifle. She hesitantly put the one in her left hand down, and poked carefully at the girl. &quot;I swear, if this gets me infected with cute-itis... Hey! You awake?&quot; She hissed, snapping her hand back to grab at the knife if the girl decided to try and shoot her.</p>

            <p>Caroline flinched and spun around, just a touch too startled to, say... aim the gun at what could have been a very large Furby thing, for all she knew.<br><br>&quot;Uh, yes?&quot; Caroline asked in response to her bespectacled companion&#39;s question. &quot;I mean, I <i>think</i> I am, but I just shot - and blew up - a giant, apparently conscious Furby thing wielding a fluffy baton, so I&#39;m still kind of hoping I&#39;m asleep.&quot; She narrowed her eyes, peering at her pajama-and-slippers-clad - er, slipper (why was she only wearing one?) - companion through her own glasses.<br><br>&quot;You aren&#39;t in league with the cuties,&quot; she asked suspiciously, &quot;are you?&quot;</p>

            <p>Helen was woken by a strange chirping sound coming from her wardrobe. Fervently wishing she played some sort of sport that involved heavy bats, she picked up her pillow to use as a shield and flung the wardrobe door open. A bright pink bird with alarmingly huge eyes peered up at her.<br>With a cooing sound it spread its wings and crashed straight into the pillow Helen had raised. Said pillow twisted into a heart shape and blurred into baby blue.<br>Helen dropped it and glared at the bird which had landed on her previously plain lampshade, which was now sparkly yellow and covered in swaying tassels. &quot;What have you done to my clothes?&quot; Helen snapped, now staring in horror at the pink filled interior of the wardrobe.<br>Helen grabbed the heaviest book in her room, a hardback copy of the Complete Works of Lewis Carroll, and launched  it at the bird. It hit and continued, taking the bird and the lampshade through the window, which briefly became frosted before shattering.<br>By the time the bird struggled back up to the window, helen had vanished.</p>

            <p>“LZ is hot!” came a shout from above the girls, and a few seconds afterwards, someone broke through the ceiling and landed near them, showering them with plaster, small pieces of concrete and other assorted bits and pieces.<br>After the dust cleared, they could see a man – he seemed to be in his early twenties – wearing a brown, shabby longcoat, sporting a ginger-coloured goatee and black eyeglasses, and holding an M-16A1 rifle. “Oh, hey,” he said. “Am I the only one who was attacked by-”<br>He cut himself short as something pink shot toward them from the hole he entered the building through; raising his rifle, he aimed and fired, causing a rain of pink, glitter-studded feathers to land on him and the girls.

            <p>Well, they COULD be, as long as it was consistent with what&#39;s been established - World One-like being invaded by CAFs. An android could fit, I suppose, as long as androids are not widespread, or the android is a time traveler, or a secret creation of a Mad Scientist genius, or something... Just explain the android&#39;s presence, and I think it&#39;ll work out fine! </p>
