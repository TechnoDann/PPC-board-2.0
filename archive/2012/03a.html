            <p>It&#39;s good, but it feels a bit off somehow. I think it&#39;s that it&#39;s a bit hollow.<br>The emotions feel underplayed. If I found a snake in my bed, I would shriek, but it&#39;s brushed off very quickly. I know that some people react to different situations, but it doesn&#39;t seem realistic.<br>Also, I don&#39;t understand Saline. The whole thing about her being tough, but really caring about her partner feels like it came out of no where. It could just be me missing some crucial bits like I have been lately, and if it is, please tell me.<br>Other than that though, good work!</p>

            <p>Yay!  We&#39;ve got a card shop now!  Now I have somewhere to send [unnamed future agent] for his <i>Magic</i> cards!<br><br>I&#39;m curious about a couple of things.  What misspelling caused Priyala&#39;s anemia?  Apologies if it was already mentioned in another piece and I&#39;ve forgotten.<br><br>Also, what blueprint is Saline looking at in the end?  Is it for Medical, or some building in a particular canon?  Why is she studying it?</p>

            <p>In general. About the things San said and all that stuff and it will probably return later on. I&#39;ve been writing on it.<br><br>About the anemia: That&#39;s from her fic of origin, which was PPCed by Guvnor. Sleeping Sue and the Eight Minis or something like that. It was supposed to be amnesia.<br><br>About the blueprint: Do you <i>really</i> want to know? Nah, it&#39;s probably something technical. Maybe a death ray. I&#39;ll expand on that too. For Sal, it&#39;s most likely the better alternative to reading a crappy magazine.<br><br>So, look out for Interlude++.</p>

            <p>Hello! I&#39;m from Portland OR in the US of A. Favorite fictions include Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Battletech/Mechwarrior, and whatever strikes my fancy at the time. I tend to jump from crossover to crossover, explaining how I got from Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings to Battletech/My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. The second crossover had a goodfic. I don&#39;t know how they did it. Anyway, here I am!</p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve just discovered (entirely by accident) that we have not one but two copies of Maglor Feanorion running around the PPC: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Dafydd_Illian">Dafydd Illian</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Hawthorne">Hawthorne Agamemnon Morgan</a>. I think that&#39;s awesome, and if Dafydd wasn&#39;t retired, I&#39;d be trying to arrange a meeting.<br><br>Then I remembered the existence of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Phoenix">Team Phoenix</a>, and specifically <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Alec_Trevelyan">Alec Trevelyan</a>, and I got to wondering: how many other copies, replacements and dopplegangers of canon characters does the PPC have on the books? &#39;cause they should totally have a party.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In his homefic, Kelok was supposed to be Todd the Wraith from Stargate Atlantis.<br><br>The characterization was so far off that he was deemed an OC that couldn&#39;t assimilate into the background, and he was recruited. Since he was supposed to be Todd, he has some memories of being Todd, but they are terribly faint and usually just leave him with confusing bad dreams. He has only a passing physical similarity to Todd, and completely lacks the distinctive, and awesome, deep voice that Todd has. Also, thankfully, he lacks the ambition and drive to rule two galaxies that Todd had, or he couldn&#39;t have been recruited.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll admit that Grace and Connor aren&#39;t that similar, but Grace (or &#39;Cameron&#39; as she was originally known) was supposed to be Connor&#39;s sensible sister who didn&#39;t crack jokes and spent her time wistfully staring at Cutter and building machinery.

            <p>&quot;Imitations&quot; might be the way to go. It&#39;s splitting hairs, but I think &quot;copy&quot; has a more physical connotation, and &quot;imitation&quot; can mean anything from looks to behavior to whatever, and it&#39;s also built in that there can be poor or excellent imitations, though possibly with a bias toward &quot;poor.&quot; If something is copied, on the other hand, I think the standard assumption is an exact physical copy.<br><br>Does that make sense?<br><br>(Also, that was you on the wiki?

            <p>Kitty&#39;s description is pretty Sue-ish- there&#39;s not enough time after her introduction to really establish her as a Sue, but the &quot;trendy&quot; descriptor combined with resilience is a warning sign. Still, there&#39;s not enough there to really pin anything on her.<br><br>But honestly, this isn&#39;t anywhere near bad enough to spork. It actually does seem to respect the Bartimeus canon, as far as I can tell. In fact, just judging from what I can see in the three chapters avaliable, I would probably read more of this. It&#39;s not super great, but it isn&#39;t bad either.</p>

            <p>Ohmygosh, you have NO idea how good that makes me feel. <br>This was the very first fanfic I ever wrote. And I binge-read the Bartimeus books beforehand to make sure I got the flavour right.<br><br><sup><sup>;</sup></sup> I&#39;m aware that this fic has issues, but most of them are more to do with characterization than plot.</p>

            <p>So, I was looking around the Pit, when I found something horrible, stupid, and canon-breaking. Its author calls it &#39;Legendary Heroes&#39; and it&#39;s a Nanoha/Harry Potter crossover.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7484814/1/Legendary_Heroes"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7484814/1/Legendary_Heroes">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7484814/1/Legendary_Heroes</a></a><br><br>It breaks logic every five sentences. Within the first chapter Nanoha is either massively possessed or just replaced. Please,  please someone help me to PPC this thing. Fair warning: Whoever does this can expect long, long rants. I have references.</p>

            <p>I couldn&#39;t read past the first paragraph, it was so disjointed.  <br><br>First, &quot;A special charm&quot; is just about the worst way to describe magic while still using proper grammar, and I have vagueness in spell descriptions, the author could, at least, NAME the spell Dumbledore is casting!<br><br>Second, who wouldn&#39;t notice that their boss is holding a BROOM?  Brooms are large, bulky, and very obvious, so missing that someone has one is inexcusable.  The writer could at least mention that the broom was shrunken, and hidden in Dumbledore&#39;s pocket, if he didn&#39;t want anyone to know he was going somewhere.  <br><br>Third, this is Albus Dumbledore we&#39;re talking about here!  Can&#39;t he just apparate to where he wants to go?</p>

            <p>Yeah. The main character works for an interdimensional organization that thinks mages are extremely rare--there&#39;ve been, as far as they know, two good mages in the last 100 years or so. The main character, Nanoha, also recently suffered a massive injury that means if she uses a lot of magic, she could lose her ability to use it completely. <br><br>Suddenly, a guy on a broom flies up to her and wants her to teach at his magic school, in a subject she knows nothing about, when she is eleven years old, has school and training for the aforementioned agency, and CAN&quot;T USE A TON OF MAGIC. AS IN, WHAT HOGWARTS TEACHES. AT A SCHOOL THAT SHOULD NOT EXIST. See any problems here? I don&#39;t think Dumbledore even explains what Hogwarts IS. <br><br>Oh, and Nanoha&#39;s family tree is a teeny-bit small. See, her dad is a retired ninja bodyguard, who quit the business, married, and changed his name after most of his family died. His only relative, other than his children, is his sister, whose husband died and who works at an antiterrorist organization in China, I think. This fic says that Snape is Nanoha&#39;s UNCLE.

            <p>Guys, I realized something today. Something important.<br><br> I realized that, since the universe is infinite, every possibility has occurred. This means that, somewhere incomprehensibly far away, there is another planet, precisely like Earth down to the position of every last atom of gold, where the only difference in anything at all ever is that I have a natural purple streak in my hair.<br><br> This also means that somewhere, Lord of the Rings, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Harry Potter, and all our other beloved fandoms, are reality. It would only be a matter of advancing our technology far enough to get us there. Think about it.<br><br> Somewhere, there is a real Boromir, who is, right at this moment, taking arrows for Frodo. There is a real Fluttershy caring for a cute little bunny. There is a real Harry, defeating Voldemort. There is a real Martin the Warrior, battling Tsarmina of the Thousand Eyes. There is a real Sunflower Official, assigning the very missions the Assassins carry out each day, a real Mysterious Somebody attempted a coup d&#39;etat, and a real Agent Kayliegh has Macespace. It&#39;s a mind-blowing possibility, isn&#39;t it?<br><br> Thoughts, anyone?</p>

            <p>Well, for one thing, we&#39;re pretty sure the universe isn&#39;t infinite, if only because if it were, it would instantly collapse due to gravity.<br><br>(If we assume it&#39;s going for infinite /time/, then yeah, any physically possible arrangement of matter will happen. Eventually. Like, we&#39;re talking gigaSagans of times longer that the entire age of the universe to date eventually, even for little things like human reincarnation, let alone planetary or societal. And then there&#39;s the Omega Point thing...)<br><br>However, some stuff just isn&#39;t going to happen. Anything actually physically possible will, but magic isn&#39;t just going to pop out of the ether, and the Discworld isn&#39;t going  to hold together no matter how much quantum you throw at it. <br><br>Also, even if there is a multiverse, I&#39;m pretty sure that trans-fictional travel doesn&#39;t exist. Because, goddammit, I imagined that there was an alternate-reality version of me with multiversal travel who was about to decide to come visit me SO MANY TIMES when I was a kid and nobody ever picked me up.</p>

            <p>String Theory. Strings hold the universe together. If this is true, than it could easily be infinite. Either String Theory is right, or Gravity isn&#39;t what it seems.<br><br> And who&#39;s to say that the magic isn&#39;t just super-advanced science they don&#39;t know is science? Any sufficiently advanced technology will appear as magic anyway, right? They never detailed the mechanics of magic in any of the involved universes, insofar as I know. Maybe that&#39;s what it is: sufficiently advanced technology. And they don&#39;t know that themselves, so they call it magic for lack of a better word.<br><br> Eh. Trans-fictional travel might work with, once again, sufficiently advanced technology. It&#39;s just teleportation over very long distances, if my little theory is right.</p>

            <p>Welll....<br><br>First off that&#39;s... that actually has nothing to do with how string theory works. At all.<br><br>Also, (at least under our current understanding of the universe,) some things just aren&#39;t possible in a physical medium. No matter how much &quot;sufficiently advanced technology&quot; you throw at things, a pony with wings the size of chicken&#39;s is never, ever, going to hit Mach 5.

            <p>I&#39;m no physicist, but I&#39;m pretty sure multiverse theory does not work that way. My best explanation for the entire thing is similar to how Sweeper from Terry Pratchett&#39;s <i>Night Watch</i> puts it: &quot;It says that if anything that can happen without breaking any physical laws, it <i>must</i> happen. [...] It means the universe is not infinite, and people&#39;s choices are far more vital than they think.&quot; (p.81)  <br><br>As far as I know, magic, high fantasy stuff, and all the like cannot possibly exist according to our established laws of physics and are confined to fiction. <br><br>That doesn&#39;t make them any less wonderful, of course, and they still exist in our imagination.</p>

The asphalt was damp, whether with dew or the night&#39;s rain, he didn&#39;t know and didn&#39;t much care. All he cared about was getting home: home to his wife, home to his son, and (last but not least) home to bed.<br><br>A sound caught his ear, and he stopped the bike, looking round. In one of the trees overhanging the road (and he remembered when there were far more of them) a bird was singing, welcoming the new day in its own way. Huinesoron smiled. &#39;I know how you feel,&#39; he murmured. &#39;Have a good one.&#39;<br><br>And he rode on.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>That&#39;s fiction (I should know, and I&#39;ve never done that), but it could be reality... let&#39;s see... this coming Thursday at the earliest (since I&#39;m not cycling home until then). So what makes that different from LotR? Other than quality.<br><br>hS, pedant to the last</p>

            <p>Perhaps I should have just left this idea with myself. I&#39;d like the believe that, somewhere, even as I type, Celestia and Luna lower their sun and raise their moon, changing day to night and hanging their stars in their sky, so very like our own, and yet so very far away. Maybe one day, contact will be made, from them to us with magic. But until then, I am content with my imaginary Fluttershy plushy. *snuggles imagined plushy*<br><br> Actually, I&#39;m going to Halifax in about a week, so I might be able to get an actual Fluttershy plushy. Yay! If only I can convince whichever poor Corporal gets stuck as my buddy to go to Toys R Us and then into the section containing the MLP toys.</p>

            <p>Well, I try not to think about <i>those</i> places. I&#39;d rather just find my wonderful Fluttershy. But the chances of that happening are so ridiculously small it&#39;s actually depressing.<br><br> You know what&#39;s even scarier than the thought of us all being Neo-Nazis? Goddamn Daleks. I&#39;m not even Whovian, but I know what they&#39;re like.<br><br> But let&#39;s focus on the ponies. The most depressing thing about that is that if, someplace, FiM is real, so is G3. But there&#39;s totally a Fluttershy out there, and we all want her. *cuddles imagined Fluttershy plushy, squees a little*<br><br> Also, I can&#39;t stand revolvers. I just think they&#39;re a terrible choice. Six shots at best, at least ten seconds reload time, a pain in the arse to carry around all that loose ammunition, not to mention the fact that revolvers are generally large, bulky, noisy, high-calibre weapons that are near impossible to conceal and will have about twenty guys on you with the first shot you fire. With revolvers, your best bet is actually a Pugnose .38, because they&#39;re a relatively small-calibre revolver (most are .45) with a short barrel, and it isn&#39;t quite so generally big. It&#39;s still a loud bugger, but it&#39;s actually better than a Colt, at least for my purposes.</p>

            <p>I am having this conversation with a woman, yes? Marry me. Yes, revolvers are BA and fun to use, but it&#39;s just not practical in the age of SMGs and automated turrets.<br><br> If I had the choice, I&#39;d leave it all behind to go to Equestria. Even if I had to remain human, I would be happy there. I wouldn&#39;t miss much. I&#39;d be too preoccupied with helping Fluttershy to think about the Internets, Scratch would take care of music when need be, and I honestly don&#39;t like my family. I&#39;d be glad to be away from them. Besides, Equestria could use a human defender in the event of a crisis. The Elements do their job, but a little assistance would certainly help.<br><br> And if I couldn&#39;t go to Equestria, I&#39;d probably choose Mossflower-verse. More specifically, Redwall Abbey or Salamandastron. I could fit in at either place, really. It&#39;s far more dangerous there than some other continua I could choose, that&#39;s what makes it fun, yeah?</p>

            <p>As much as I love the Potter-&#39;verse, I really couldn&#39;t live there. As a Muggle, I wouldn&#39;t be able to enjoy the reasons I would be going there in the first place.<br><br> Middle-Earth? Too many Nazgыl, Orcs, Goblins, giant goddamn spiders, and other unpleasant etcetera, too few awesome parties to make up for it.<br><br> Narnia? Oh, Hell no. I wouldn&#39;t go there. I&#39;d probably wind up doing my level best to kill Aslan and Peter, and where would that leave the continuum? It use to be a favorite, until I got old enough to notice all the religious undertones. That doesn&#39;t make the writing low-quality, but it just started to irk me. Aslan quickly became a very annoying character, I don&#39;t mind telling you, and I hated Peter anyway. And I could totally go off on a sexism rant about what Father Christmas said about women going into battle, but that would take too long.<br><br> I haven&#39;t read any of the other continuua you mentioned yet, although I plan on reading Discworld as soon as I finish off Watership Down.<br><br>In descending order here: Equestria, Mossflower, and then last but not least Mockingjay-era Panem. [SPOILERS COMMENCE] I know that last one sounds insane, but what better way to pass the time than sit on a roof in the beautiful Capitol, wait for a target, and help the forces of good?

            <p>Oh, yeah, I&#39;ve read Inkheart/Inkspell/Inkdeath. It&#39;s been a while though. Dustfinger is goddamn awesome. Him and Orpheus.<br><br> I had a nightmare about Watership Down once. I was a rabbit. Got stuck in a snare like Thlayli did. Elil all around, and no Owsla to help me, no other rabbits at all. Then the elil vanished and Cowslip appeared with the others from that big warren and they danced around screaming, just as bad as the elil. Freaked me right out. Woke up with my headphones wrapped around my neck. Didn&#39;t sleep for the next two days.<br><br> What?! A deep-seated hatred for a thing as wonderful and wholesome as MLP? I assure you Equestria is not as pink and fluffy as you assume. If you watch the pilots, there&#39;s some serious stuff being done. The antagonist tries to kill our six friends no fewer than two times during the course of events, although the ending is kinda cheesy. And the S1 opener isn&#39;t even the best example. That would be S2 opener. It&#39;s goddamn hilarious, but still retains definite elements of danger. Another good episode is &quot;Over a Barrel&quot;. Seriously, watch all of S1, and then go read &quot;My Little Dashie&quot;. You will gusta the ponies after that. If you don&#39;t, my Agents owe yours a bottle of Bleepka once I get Permission.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t like Orpheus much, mostly because he screwed Dustfinger over so bad.

            <p>Very true. I shot an assault rifle once, too. There was a lot less of a kick than I expected, but the thing was so loud I could feel it in my teeth.<br><br>Were I to go to Equestria, I would have to drag my brother along with me, because I don&#39;t think he&#39;d forgive me if I didn&#39;t. And who needs internets when you&#39;re surrounded by ponies? That&#39;s like 80% of the internet right there.<br><br>Redwall&#39;s awesome, I would totally live there. Surrounded by good food and awesome people, and all I&#39;d have to do to live comfortably is help out with dishwashing and such. Plus, they don&#39;t really have a real religion, so it&#39;s totally cool that I&#39;m agnostic.</p>

            <p>Barret .50 cal sniper rifles are louder. And the newer ones might burn you if you shoot funny.<br><br> As to living at Redwall, I&#39;d be hard pressed to choose between there and Salamandastron. Salamandastron could always use another Sergeant, but Redwall would be much more comfortable. And I&#39;m an Atheist, I think they&#39;d even accept that. It would be equally easy to make friends in either place, and the fare is fine and plentiful at both.<br><br> But Equestria would be better than either. Food is still fine and plentiful, and, while I wouldn&#39;t dare eat anything furred for fear it&#39;s sapient, there are still fish I could eat as my meat/alternatives. There would be a great many jobs I could do, friends would be in no short supply, and of course I might be able to find some sort of untapped magic, should the matter of their world sink into me enough. And then there would be the matter of finally finding out why places like the Everfree obey our laws rather than theirs. Equestria just has so much more for me.<br><br> Hehe, 80% of the Internets. What&#39;s the other 20? Because it&#39;s not cooler.</p>

            <p>They&#39;re ARTILLERY. Developed for extreme long range sniping and anti-vehicle duty.

            <p>I was close enough. Anti-tank rifle, basically. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s not only tanks. Still fires bullets, not shells. There&#39;s still rifling in the barrel, unless someone figured out a way to make something halfway accurate without rifling. And it&#39;s still shoulder controlled. The kickback would probably dislocate your shoulder if you weren&#39;t wearing the right gear, though. And I was still right that it will burn your face if you shoot funny.<br><br> Yes, it would take care of &quot;bulletproof&quot; Sues. It would take care of them very well. One explosive round to the gut later, and all you have to clean up is the mist of blood that fell over everything, and a couple of stray body parts that you could easily just put through the Cafeteria&#39;s meat grinder. It&#39;s not like anyone would notice the difference in the food anyway.</p>

            <p>I thought it had to be fired only from its bipod, though. Well, one of my Agents owns an M82A1, and is going to use it in his next mission. He&#39;s going to fire it from a prone position with bipod unfolded, as he&#39;s not very muscular.</p>

            <p>Okay, I think I should go more in details about what I (dis)liked about this mission.<br><br>The main thing that bothered me was, as said, the fact that you skip many fic pieces that could be interesting. A good example would be the faux-Shakespearian author&#39;s note with the three minis. That sounds like something that should be seen rather than be read about. Or maybe something about Sarah&#39;s backstory. You&#39;re just <i>telling</i> things instead of showing them. I felt kinda left out on the action.<br><br>The other thing: I mentioned it before and I will mention it again. Betas are important. Even if you&#39;re the world SPaG champion, you still make mistakes. Or you&#39;re too immersed in your mission to notice how things aren&#39;t as obvious as you think they are. Betas are your more or less independent second (third/fourth) pair of eyes. You&#39;ll almost <i>never</i> catch every mistake you make. I already marked some things, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more. I think I caught a missing period somewhere. Would be ironic if you poke at the Suethor for messing up periods if you do it yourself.<br><br>On the other hand, not everything was bad. You managed to point things out well, I just love edible girl and your agents are working just fine. It wasn&#39;t a great mission, but if you iron out your mistakes and get someone to read over it closely, it could be good.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think a final decision has been made on the process for adding new pages, but if they&#39;re just your basic textbook Sues, that pretty much disqualifies them.<br><br>Regarding the mission, I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t done more than glance at it, and that&#39;s because it looks unfinished: there are comments in the margins that I assume your beta made, and among other things you desperately need double line-breaks between ALL your paragraphs.

            <p>The bad news: This is not as good as your last mission, or your last interlude<br><br>The good news: It isn&#39;t bad<br><br>So I have to say, I really like the reactions to the trollfic in this. They&#39;re funny, and believable, and bear a resemblance to something I like to do in my owns spinoff, so I guess we think kind of the same. <br><br>Unfortunately, this suffers from one of the things I mentioned about your last mission to an even greater extent. Namely, I have trouble telling exactly where your agents are. You do an excellent job of describing the environment, but where your agents are in relation to each other and the things around them is unclear. I understand that this is hard to do in a mission with so few (read: one) canon location(s). Still I often had to try to figure out where your agents were purely based on context, and was not always able to. The troll battle, when this was most critical, was hard to follow.<br><br>So yeah. In all, not a bad mission, but you have written better. </p>

            <p>I know the book exist, it was mentioned in the Author&#39;s Note. I haven&#39;t read it, but I googled it thoroughly and for one thing, in the book Laurie is ten or eleven, while in the fic, she is eight.<br>Laurie in the fic hardly ever shows any signs of being a little girl, but is able to do the same things at the adults. Her reactions are also wrong.<br>Also, the Sue had no personality except for abused-girl-mode. Unless the canon-Laurie was seriously badly written, Laurie should have some kind of personality traits carried over from her canon self.<br>And then there&#39;s the facts that the author never calls this a crossover, and that he/she ripped off Narnia. So I think a case can be made for character replacement.<br>As for the mother, in the book she apparently never abused Laurie in front of her stepsiblings and didn&#39;t think they knew about the abuse. Beating Laurie in front of Tim and locking him in a closet seems way off. And beating her with an iron fire-poker was not mentioned by any reviews or summaries so I doubt that it is from the book and it also seems like something she would not be able to claim that Laurie did to herself, so it also seems off. So I call character replacement there as well.<br>Tim and the puppy are no more than bits in what is not a crossover and Sue-Laurie never mentions either again, even though book-Laurie was very fond of both. There&#39;s hardly anything to tie them to the book.<br><br>So yes, I made a choice and I know it can be debated, but I did do a lot of research and based my interpretation on that.</p>

            <p>I liked it, I guess. At least it distracted me from being furious at my colleagues. I did like the petulant CAD, and the &#39;left with the kids&#39; vibe I got from Mittens after the RMC went off. Not too sure about some of the charges (Galadriel <i>is</i> creepy, just ask anyone in Gondor), and I&#39;m dubious about the level of analytical thought you expected from an eight-year-old (but then again, she did decide to go with the Fellowship...

            <p>Honestly? I&#39;m not sure what level of analytical thought to expect from an eight-year-old, either. I don&#39;t really know any. But she had a lot of introspection and thoughts that I thought was way over her age.<br>So my agents complained a lot, but the actual charges for &#39;bad psychology&#39; and &#39;inconsistencies&#39; were deliberately vague.<br><br>I see your point about the other one as well, and it&#39;s not the kind of thing to build a charge list on, more a case of the agents being personally annoyed.

            <p>This is very much something special, set apart from all other PPC stuff (that I&#39;ve encountered).  You guys blended the PPC agents&#39; story superbly together with the fic and made this mission deeper for it.<br><br>Cadmar and Cali have been moving towards a potential semi-argument for a while now, I think, simply because they were both being so cautious around each other, and afraid to open up.  Giving them a mission together was an elegant and unassuming way to force them to interact one-on-one and reach that point.<br><br>You somehow wrote all the mushy Cadmar/Cali scenes in a way that kept my attention throughout the entire mission.  Whihc is, like, impossible, because I hate romance.  So kudos for that.  (I would say more, but I&#39;m honestly not really sure what it is that kept me interested the whole way through.)<br><br>Like Miah said in her author note, I was &quot;waiting for the shoe to drop&quot; on how the (obviously bad) fic was going to turn bad.  Using a goodfic was an excellent choice, not only within this mission, but for the community as a whole.  As is said repeatedly, it&#39;s not about the badfic, and having PPC characters discuss a goodfic is a great way to support that attitude.  The goodfic also complements the PPC story arc well (as you pointed out) by contrasting the Sheppard/Rodney relationship with the Cadmar/Cali one.<br><br>We now know the color of Cali&#39;s eyes, but we still don;t know why he was so keen on keeping them hidden, especially since they&#39;re far from Suvian.  I realize he was a little distracted by the turn of conversation here, but it would still be nice to find out eventually why he was so secretive about this.  (Disregard if this was already talked about somewhere and I forgot.)<br><br>So yes!

            <p>This was a rather interesting idea, and for the most part, it worked. The meta aspect of it, ie, the two of you thinking this would be badfic and being pleasantly surprised, is fun. I especially enjoyed how the fic ended up giving Cali and Cadmar relationship advice. I&#39;m not a fan of MPreg, and while I&#39;m willing to bet Sheppard would quite easily be at least bi, I&#39;d also bet that Rodney is hetero. At the same time, they are literally the only slash pairing I enjoy. (Because... they&#39;re so cute together :3) So yeah, that&#39;s a personal thing, and it may bias me towards liking this mission. <br><br>On the negative side, the most major problem I saw was that the beginning drags. I might have enjoyed it more were I not waiting for the mission to start. Perhaps it could have been its own interlude?<br>The beginning also seems kind of jumbled, not in that I had trouble following it. It more seems that there are too many characters all talking at once.<br><br>Still, it was, on the whole, a good mission (if it can be called that), if not an unqualified success.</p>

            <p>Hah, thank you! Sheppard/Rodney is my favorite slash pairing too! We are glad that the twist went off as smoothly as we hoped. A good change of pace, no?<br><br>As for the negative bits, I agree with you. It can get hectic sometimes when using so many characters. We usually end ep stalling and wondering how to keep everyone active in the scene in someway. Next Mission/Interlude we do, we will try to use less people, or at least keep it more... cohesive? </p>

            <p>We thought it was a good choice for a setting for them to talk. Having two agents in a fic together gives plenty of room to explore an issue or two. Doubly so if you don&#39;t have much of a job because it is actually a goodfic :P</p>

            <p>Yeah, I was surprised too, but it worked. Reading that mission reminded me that yes, everything can be done well. Even this.<br><br>Still, while there was nothing to do PPC-wise it very well explored Cali&#39;s and Cadmar&#39;s relationship.

            <p>Glee used to be a good show, but now it just sucks. The outright worship of some characters (i.e. Rachel and Kurt) and the outright ignoring of others (i.e. Tina and Artie) drove me away, as did Glee&#39;s refusal to have any songs on it that aren&#39;t either mainstream pop, mainstream rock, mainstream hip hop or classical theatre.</p>

            <p>No idea.  You see, the PPC is a construct that is made up of people.  These people have varying thoughts on topics.  It is not often that everyone in the PPC agrees that a particular canon is either good or bad.  Cases have even been made for Twilight being decent, on occasion.<br><br>As for Glee, I don&#39;t mind it, myself.  The stories are decent, and the songs, though over-processed, can also be enjoyable.<br><br>If it is one of the canons you enjoy, then be glad that the fanfic is decent.

            <p>Don&#39;t scare me like that! I saw someone asking about Glee, and a response titled &quot;The PPC opinion,&quot; and had a brief Blue Screen of Death moment.

            <p>Hi there! First time poster, long time lurker. I&#39;m a huge lover of fiction (well obviously) and am currently living in Australia, I&#39;m a native of the United Kingdom however, from good old Manchester. As for my favourite fandoms, I am an unashamed Brony, a complete and utter Star Wars nerd, a devoted, some might almost say slavering Neil Gaiman fan, a 10th Doctor nut (can&#39;t watch the 11th, I just *can&#39;t* I feel like I am betraying the 10th if I do) and, of course, a lover of Lord of the Rings. So, here I am, introducing myself and hoping I fit in in the madness!</p>

            <p>Welcome! Have some assorted Bleep-products!<br><br> I am a fellow Brony, and there are many others. Favorite pony? (Mine is Fluttershy, which is going to seem weird if/when you get to know me better.)<br><br> What site do you hail from? I&#39;m from the Pit of Voles. Stay away from the Pit of Horny Weasels, especially the MLP section. The MLP section is, for some inexplicable reason, filled with bondage. Remember to bring your Bleeprin if you choose to go, and keep yourself away from anything physically dangerous.<br><br> Best of luck!</p>

            <p>*glomp*<br><br> Yes, Fluttershy is best pony. I have a frenemy who thinks Rarity is (&quot;Rainbow Dash is overrated&quot; my arse, damn hipster), but we stay away from that. I know a couple of guys who love RD, who is second best pony, with Pinkie being third, Applejack fourth, Rarity fifth, and Twilight being last.

            <p>I&#39;m rewriting a mission right now and the fic turned out to be even worse than I&#39;d thought, so much so that while I first cut it off at about chapter ten, I&#39;m now cutting the mission off at chapter five because there were just so many problems. If I sporked the entire thing, it&#39;d be longer than a Clive Barker novel. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t make you a bad PPCer. I&#39;ve spent months rewriting missions, mainly because real life gets in the way. No one&#39;s going to mind a lot if it takes you a while.</p>

            <p>Calm down, it will be just fine. Now, let&#39;s look at these points calmly, hm?<br><br>-If the fic is too long, select a cutoff point and let your Agents take out the Sue/Stu/slashwraith/whatever you&#39;re dealing with there. It&#39;s a perfectly legitimate tactic to have your Agents basically get fed up, go &quot;stuff this&quot; and charge once they&#39;ve collected enough charges.<br><br>(Opinion may vary on how many is &quot;enough&quot; but for general purposes I&#39;d say 15-25 is usually considered plenty, especially if the Agents have had enough of the fic.)<br><br>-Being active is appreciated, but not necessary once you actually have Permission and we know you. We&#39;ve had people fade off the radar for months or even years and then pop back up, and they get just as much welcome as any newbies. Posting one&#39;s first mission is also not something to rush with, and we don&#39;t demand that PPCers even write missions if they don&#39;t want to. Some of our members have been here years and never writen a single mission.<br><br>So in conclusion: you are not a horrible PPCer. *hugs* Just sit back and don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s pressure on you to do PPC stuff.</p>

            <p>Greetings fellow boarders! I am TheMadHatteress, lover of words and watcher of anime. I&#39;ve been stalk- er, looking at the wiki for some time now but have just decided to join in on the decussion. There are a lot of works that i love, but the fandoms that I&#39;m the most involved with are: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Axis Powers Hetalia. I also recently started reading works by Terry Pratchett, which I love. So, that&#39;s me</p>

            <p>What exactly is the distinction between capitalisation and punctuation? Okay, silly question, let&#39;s try a paraphrase: Why is it important to distinguish between the two? They should both be used together, after all, and in cases where one is missing (text messages, things like that) they both tend to vanish.<br><br>Spelling (the third part of SPG) is different, since typing &#39;taht&#39; in a text doesn&#39;t save space or time, but why are P&amp;G important to distinguish?<br><br>hS, curious and, oh yeah, bored</p>

            <p>The distinction was important to me because I didn&#39;t feel the point of my original request had been taken at all, so I felt the need to be extra-clear about what I meant. The use of a different case for some letters is functionally distinct from the use of periods, commas, etc.<br><br>Whether capitalization falls under the general header of spelling or grammar I don&#39;t know—I think Phobos and I have actually argued about this, and there&#39;s a good case for either—but it&#39;s definitely not punctuation. By definition, punctuation is the set of marks that aren&#39;t letters or numbers; capitalization has everything to do with letters.<br><br>Really, come to think of it, I think you could make the case that spelling, capitalization, and punctuation all fall under grammar, but that&#39;s no fun. Also, if you&#39;re leaving a review or beta-reading, it&#39;s more useful to be as specific as possible. If I just say &quot;some of your grammar needs work&quot; when I mean &quot;you need to capitalize the first word in your sentences, and also remember to use quotation marks around dialogue,&quot; how will they ever figure it out?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s National Reading Month here in the States, and in NeshomehLand, it&#39;s also PPC Challenge Month, when I come up with random things to stir people out of the late-winter, not-yet-spring doldrums and do stuff. Some years. When I feel like it. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>This year, I figured why not take advantage of the fact that March is Reading Month to encourage some airing of older PPC spin-offs? And then I thought, what&#39;s reading without reviewing? Hey, I can totally make a game of that! And here it is, presented on the secondary board so we don&#39;t have to worry about it falling off the front page. {= )<br><br><font size="4"><u>How Does This Work?</u></font><br><br>1. Pick a spin-off (or other PPC narrative work, I guess) by an author you&#39;ve <i>never</i> read before. This is important—half the point of this challenge is to increase exposure to stuff.<br>2. Read at least one installment in it.<br>3. Write a review.<br>4. If the author has someplace to leave reviews directly on the story, such as FF.net or LiveJournal, leave the review there where they can see it and post a link to it in a reply to this thread. If not, just post the whole review here with a link to the story.<br>5. Earn points!<br>6. Rinse and repeat until 11:59 pm Board time, March 31.<br><br><font size="4"><u>What Do You Mean, Points?</u></font><br><br>Each review you make for this challenge will earn points based on how helpful it is. To earn points, a review MUST include:<br><br>* At least one thing you thought was done well, and why.<br>* At least one thing you thought could be done better, and why.<br><br>A review WILL NOT earn points if:<br><br>* Any mention at all is made of how much the badfic or the Sue or whatever deserved to die, or how glad you are that someone killed it. This has nothing to do with the quality of the PPC story, and it&#39;s a bad habit some of you are in. Please break yourselves of it.<br>* Any bashing of the badfic author or anyone else takes place.<br>* I don&#39;t see it. As stated above, please post your review or a link to it in a reply to this thread.<br><br>For point-earning comments, &quot;why&quot; should include specifics like how the thing in question made you feel, the style choice(s) the author used (or could have used), how it impacts the section or story as a whole, and any other evidence for why it works or doesn&#39;t work. The success or failure of a story element should be measured by how strongly it affected you, the reader, and whether the effect seems to match the author&#39;s intent. Authors who care about their writing want to know these things; your review should tell them.<br><br>Each positive or negative will be worth 1-3 points, depending on how specific and clear it is and, for negatives in particular, whether it tells the author something they can use. For example:<br><br>* &quot;This didn&#39;t work for me because I&#39;m not really a fan of first person.&quot; - This meets the what-and-why requirement, but since it&#39;s a personal opinion and doesn&#39;t have anything else to say for itself, it would only be worth one point. Personal opinions are valid, but not very helpful to the author without substantiation.<br><br>* &quot;First person doesn&#39;t work so well for me; I think it would be better if you used third person instead, since it gives you more freedom with what you can show.&quot; - This would probably get two points. It&#39;s a little clearer about what the problem is (lack of narrative freedom) and gives a general direction for improvement (show more), but lacks specificity.<br><br>* &quot;This scene didn&#39;t work for me because the first-person narrative made me feel boxed into one character&#39;s head. I think there could have been more comedy in experiencing the other agent&#39;s reaction when their lust-object was thrown out of character, given how crazy he was acting, but instead the POV agent just shrugged it off and moved on, and I was stuck with her. It let the air out of the situation, and it took me out of the moment.&quot; - This would be worth probably three points, since in addition to the what-and-why, it specifically gives a reason for disliking the style (feeling trapped) and offers a suggestion for improvement (include more of the other character&#39;s side) while pointing out a specific case where the technique failed (lust-object OOC).<br><br>The same principles can be applied to positive comments, too. A three-point positive comment might look like this: &quot;The first-person narrative really worked for me. I felt in touch with the POV character&#39;s emotions the whole time, especially when her LO was thrown out of character and her heart started pounding like that. I could almost feel the fingernails digging into her palms as if they were my own. You just don&#39;t get the same visceral details in third-person. Good choice!&quot;<br><br>For further reference, I picked out something I&#39;d never read before to review and did my best to make three-point comments, though I won&#39;t presume to score myself. The spin-off is &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3223961/1/Just_Like_The_Old_Days_PPC">Just Like The Old Days PPC</a>&quot; by Agent Mackenzie, a.k.a. Gabrielle, and I <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/r/3223961/">reviewed chapter two</a>, since the first chapter is a prologue. Sadly, it turned out to be somewhat negative overall, but I took it as an opportunity to put more emphasis on offering suggestions for improvement rather than simply saying why things didn&#39;t work. I hope it comes off that way.<br><br>There is no point limit per review. The person who accumulates the most points over the course of the month wins! I don&#39;t know yet what the reward will be. How about you and I come up with something appropriate when we get there, future winner? If you&#39;re comfortable giving out a mailing address, there are more options. Chocolate comes to mind. Or whatever. We&#39;ll talk. {= )<br><br><font size="4"><u>Anticipated Questions</u></font><br><br>I suspect these are coming, so I&#39;ll try to get them answered up front:<br><br><b>Q. Do I need Permission?</b><br><b>A.</b> Heck no. Nobody ever needs permission to read things or write reviews around here.<br><br><b>Q. What if I&#39;ve read everything already?</b><br><b>A.</b> I has a dubious. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction">The Complete List of PPC Fiction</a> has an awful lot of stuff in it, not to mention keeping up with the new releases. There&#39;s bound to be something you&#39;ve missed. If you&#39;ve really devoured the PPC whole, though, congratulations. Pick anything that isn&#39;t by a currently active writer and looks under-read, I guess.<br><br><b>Q. Can I use the Original Series for this?</b><br><b>A.</b> ... If you&#39;ve made it to the Board without having read any of the Original Series yet, I admit I&#39;m disappointed in you. However, I also STRONGLY encourage you to use the opportunity to remedy the situation now, so yes, if you haven&#39;t read it yet, you can use it for this.<br><br><b>Q. What if I really can&#39;t think of anything good/bad/at all to say?</b><br><b>A.</b> Think harder. This is important—it&#39;s the other half of the point of this challenge. If you need ideas for things to comment on, try these (items blatantly snurched from something Miah posted a while back):<br><br>* The plot<br>* The characters<br>* The action<br>* The dialogue<br>* The background<br>* The overall story<br>* The theme<br>* The technical details (spelling, grammar, PPC or other canon details), etc.<br><br><b>Q. Isn&#39;t this whole &quot;points&quot; thing kind of arbitrary if you&#39;re the only judge?</b><br><b>A.</b> Yeah, it totally is. I&#39;ve tried to make my criteria very clear, and I will stick to them, but tell you what: if you find you strongly disagree with me a lot, you can run the challenge next time. {= D<br><br><b>Q. What if I just decide to make a gazillion reviews with a squillion one-point comments?</b><br><b>A.</b> Please don&#39;t. The idea is to reward good, thoughtful, constructive reviews, not winning for winning&#39;s sake. If I think you&#39;re deliberately trying to break the game in this or any other way, I will throw you out of the running.<br><br><b>Q. Can I make multiple reviews for one spin-off, if there are multiple installments?</b><br><b>A.</b> I debated over this one, but yes, that&#39;s fine. Beware, however, I may not give you points for saying the same things you said about previous installments unless it&#39;s very clear why they need to be repeated. It might be easier to review something new each time.<br><br>If you have any more questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask! I hope this will be fun, and I know I have more fun when I understand what the heck is going on. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh,</sup></sup> Giver of Points and Keeper of the Score</p>

Vulcans may be generally non-violent, but they are capable of killing and practice a canon martial art with at least one deadly maneuver.  Infinity&#39;s extreme pacifism, in and of itself, isn&#39;t bad.  But it makes me wonder why she signed on to be an Assassin in the first place.  It seems a bit late for her to be objecting to the job requirements.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure who wrote these. I didn&#39;t see the author listed on the mission heading, or anywhere on the wiki, so I don&#39;t believe I have read this author before. I know I have never read these agents before. This is more negative than I would normally like to be, but I have tried to include the things that I liked and thought were well done.<br><br><br>Notes in parenthesis, while generally entertaining became distracting and brought me out of the story when they were happening in multiple, successive paragraphs. There were a total of twenty of these in this mission. I have a personal bad habit of wanting to make this kinds of statements when I talk or chat. I usually manage to cut them down in chat, you&#39;re just out of luck if you talk to me directly, anyway I know the temptation to use these, but they really make the writing look amateurish. If it was perhaps one or maybe even two in the mission, it would probably be tolerable, but twenty is way too many.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how Dee could think that Milask is a pet if he is the same kind of cat as Cat on Red Dwarf was. Cat was very clearly more humanoid than feline.<br><br>Dee is really not making a very good impression on me. I think she is trying to be funny, but she is really coming across as unneccesarily mean. It started with continuing on the pet thread after being told several times that Milask is not a pet, asking if he needed a litter box, and just generally not listening to him, and then the comment below, was almost funny. It made me think of the Cat and his wardrobe, but the &#39;I don&#39;t wanna!&#39; whining followed by her stating that being nice is no fun, ruined the funny for me. I like reading about nice people most of the time. At least when it is people that are not nice, I like them to be up front about it. Nume is not particularly nice, but he tells you about it. Orken tries very hard to not be nice, and he also is up front about it. I guess I don&#39;t want to empathize very much with characters that are sneakily not nice.<br><br><b>&quot;Great, not only was her partner not of the same species, but he was vain also. The list just went on and on... &#39;Be nice,&#39; her inner voice admonished. &#39;But I don&#39;t wanna!&#39; she whined. Being nice, or attempting to be nice, was no fun. </b><br><br><br><b>&quot;I get the picture,&quot; said Milask, putting up his hand in annoyance.</b>  <br><br>And now we have Milask being short when Dee wasn&#39;t being particularly annoying.<br><br><b>Milask went down on all fours and chased after Harry,</b> <br><br>Admittedly, I haven&#39;t seen the seventh and eighth series of Red Dwarf, but I can&#39;t imagine Cat ever getting down on all fours to chase anything. Whinging about how could anyone expect him to chase anything in a suit like this, would be something I would expect. &#39;What and mess up this hair?&#39; I can imagine him saying. One of my favorite scenes with the Cat is early on, he has a little spray bottle and he&#39;s walking down the halls spritzing everything. &quot;This is mine. And this is mine. And this is mine. And this is mine, too. Oh look, this is MINE.&quot; He certainly wasn&#39;t pulling down his drawers and using bodily fluids. And that was the thing that made him so funny for me. He was acting like such a cat, while at the same time showing that his species had evolved into something so much more.<br><br><b>COMPLETE CHARACTER RUPTURE IMMINENT!!!!! DANGER WILL ROBINSON DANGER!!!]<br><br>Dee raised her eyebrows: Makes-Things had obviously been watching too much Lost in Space.</b><br><br>I liked this one. It made me smile, and there were no odd agent reactions pulling me back from smiling about it.<br><br><b>&quot;You&#39;re not a feline! At least... not right ...now,&quot; she said, looking him up and down. Damn tall person (who used to be a cat). Actually... he didn&#39;t look too bad as a human...</b> <br><br>What is this? The Cat on Red Dwarf was just a catboy, not a shapeshifter. This is really becoming my complete focus in reading this mission. It has distracted me totally away from the badfic and the sporking.<br><br><b>&quot;And ruin my robes? I don&#39;t think so. Look, a crease!&quot; Milask grabbed a mini iron from his backpack (who knows what he was doing with it on a PPC mission) and ironed the crease out of the robe.</b> <br><br>Now THAT is the kind of reaction I was looking for!<br><br><b>&quot;Chocolate?&quot; asked Dee. &quot;Nothing in this story makes sense and it&#39;s better to not analyze it too much.&quot; Chocolate is the answer to all your problems. When in pain, have some chocolate.</b><br><br>I almost feel like she has forgotten to be nasty here.Like she might accidentally be being nice without feeling like it is a terrible thing.<br><br>This had absolutely the shortest exorcism I&#39;ve ever read. One whack with a book, and one order, and it&#39;s completely over with. I know they tend to be more drawn out now, sometimes too much so, but this seemed anti-climatic...right up until there was another more elaborate exorcism, with the expected author wraith. Which confuses me. Why did they go back to being in-character with one smack, and then have to have the phantom exorcised after that?<br><br>The ending scene with the General Store was nice. I was immediately interested in Leto. He&#39;s taking pride in the simple state of having things neat and tidy. I can imagine him standing at the counter looking over things in a proprietary manner. Then he goes on with the blurb about the minis not getting along, and the problems it would cause, followed by the  feeling of responsibility he feels toward keeping the PPC on its feet by supplying sanity supporting vices to the agents. I&#39;ve seen the General Store mentioned many times, mostly on the wiki, but I&#39;ve never read actual characterization of it in a mission, and this was very nice. My agents might visit it now that I&#39;ve watched this scene as I read it.<br><br><b>Overall impressions:</b> The issues with Milask at the beginning of the mission really, really bothered me. By the end of the mission, these had improved drastically. It almost felt like perhaps, the author was working from a distant memory in the first half of the mission, and then re-watched some episodes of Red Dwarf and began basing Milask&#39;s characterization on that. The improvement between what I expected from Milask being a Red Dwarf cat and how he actually behaved was drastic to the point of that it actually made me stop and stare at the story when he did something that would have been in-character for the Cat. <br><br>Dee didn&#39;t make a good impression on me at first either, and I am not sure that I can easily forget that first impression. With Milask, the issues were more technical, like his species shouldn&#39;t look like that, that reaction isn&#39;t right, etc. It wasn&#39;t a problem with Milask as a character so much as a problem of cognitive dissonance between Milask as written and the statement that he was a Red Dwarf Cat. With Dee, the problem was very much one of her characterization. I found several intances, which I pointed out, where I just didn&#39;t like her as a person. When she later behaved without the nasty comments, I was left wondering where they went. <br><br>Come to think about it, her nastiness was replaced with nearly unbridled lustiness at about the same time that Milask started acting more like a Red Dwarf Cat. I am now thinking that this mission was almost certainly written in two sessions, probably separated by a good chunk of time. The second session was much improved over the first. To be honest, I never would have finished reading this mission, if I hadn&#39;t told myself that I was going to do this concrit piece on it. And if I had stopped, I never would have read that excellent General Store section at the end. <br><br>The second half of the mission had me thinking that this agent pair might be worth reading again, and the General Store section clenched it. I will give them another shot.<br></p>

            <p>((Terri&#39;s work again - I&#39;m just the brain behind her))<br><br><b>From the Personal Files of Terri Ryan, Department of Personnel</b><br><br>Well, I&#39;ve been issued an informal warning by the R&amp;R Division. Apparently my justification for breaking the structure of my last review was insufficient, and I failed to mention sufficient items. I&#39;ll try to do better this time. I&#39;m going to be using a primarily chronological structure, with one alteration to fit the recommended Good-Bad-Good pattern.<br><br>Mission: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19VdvA8tekgjydxs7dex_QvdwQs46RQCwu2v2hL0BV4w/edit?hl=en_US">PPC Crusade/The Crusader King</a><br>Agents: Arthur Briggs and Lynn Gillies, DMS<br><br>Straight off the mark, this mission was highly immersive. Just after the agents receive their mission, we see the following exchange:<br><br><i>You’re the only one in this RC with canon knowledge, which makes you primary agent for this mission.”<br><br>“Me?” Gillies squeaked. She cleared her throat and tried again. “But I’m not a full agent yet.”<br><br>“That doesn’t matter. The Duty is what’s important, and in this case you’re best suited to perform it.&quot;</i><br><br>This simple dialogue gives me a perfect feel for the agents. I could immediately contrast Gillies, squeaking and uncertain, with Briggs, saying &#39;the Duty is what&#39;s important&#39;. The former is still settling into the PPC, while the latter, with his military background, is right at home. I immediately felt I knew the pair of them - and that I cared about what happened to them. All from a few lines of dialogue that let character flow through.<br><br>I also found myself drawn in in a different manner. This mission didn&#39;t feel like it took place in isolation: it was firmly part of a larger world. Two examples:<br><br><i>“In that case, you program the disguises while I visit the Canon Library.&quot;</i><br><br>and<br><br><i>[Present Tense Detected. Revert Agents To Past Tense Y/N?]<br><br>Briggs sighed as the reset took effect. “Much better. Once you make full Agent, see if you can talk DoSAT into adding a tense stabiliser to your CAD.”</i><br><br>Now, I&#39;m not just quoting these because of my affection for the subjects of them, although that certainly plays a part. The Canon Librarian is a lot like me, insofar as I know anything about him, so it&#39;s good to see him getting some attention. The tense stabiliser first appeared on DOGA-modified CADs - I didn&#39;t realise it had gone into mass production. But that&#39;s not the point here.<br><br>The point is, I really get a feel for how the wider world of HQ impacts on this agent pair. I can now imagine them having friends and enemies, favourite haunts and secret shortcuts - not because of anything I know about <i>them</i>, but because their narrative so casually drops in pieces of their - our - world. This is clearly something they are intimately involved with, not just sitting on the outskirts of.<br><br>Oh, and it helps that they mention DOGA later by name. Pyro Department, getting the love.<br><br>Unfortunately, not everything is positive. While character-defining moments like my first quote exist, they are swamped by the fact that much of the dialogue can be split into two categories: charges, and infodumps.<br><br>Charges are important, we all know that, but there is more to a mission than the charge list. What I want to see is the agents&#39; reactions to what happens, not simply the pigeonhole they slot it into. At its worst, this report descends into merely ticking boxes - literally, in fact, since Briggs is described as &#39;checking off&#39; Thesaurus Abuse. This does not make for fascinating reading, unfortunately, and it foreshadows another problem: the entire list is quotes at the end, in massive block quotes.<br><br>There are two issues here. Firstly, how to deal with charges? I believe they don&#39;t all need to be mentioned. It is assumed that there <i>is</i> a list - that&#39;s a PPC Agent&#39;s job, after all - so it doesn&#39;t particularly need mentioning. Certainly the more amusing ones should be brought up - there is a scene where Briggs and Gillies discuss with evident satisfaction a pair of charges raised in a single time-jump, and it is entertaining to say the least - but the majority can pass unmarked.<br><br>Then there is the recitation. I know it&#39;s fashionable among some agents to create the largest list possible, but really, we don&#39;t need to see it. Read it to the &#39;Sue, by all means, but don&#39;t make me sit through it. Rather, edit what actually happened a little. Give me the highlights, the interesting bits, the collated and condensed version, and I&#39;ll read it. Give me the whole thing, and I&#39;ll skip ahead.<br><br>Then there are the infodumps. On the one hand, one agent is unfamiliar with the canon - and since this is the only Belgariad mission report I&#39;ve ever seen, I imagine many casual readers are too. In that respect, a certain amount of information has to be provided. And, I must admit, Gillies handles it better than some - she breaks her dumps into small sections, allowing me time to recover in between, and theoretically absorb what I&#39;m given. However, there are so <i>many</i> of them. Is all the information necessary? I don&#39;t know. Could it be condensed, cut down to the bare essentials and the funny parts? I suspect so.<br><br>But overall, I did enjoy this report. Possibly my favourite moment came near the end: in order to research something, Agent Briggs sent a letter to the Medical Department - using one of the lanterns said to be &#39;filing the room&#39;. Not everyone would even have caught the typo (and as we know, agent observation has a massive effect on badfic canon), but Briggs used it to his advantage. Once again I gained insight into him, and saw his place in the larger world of the PPC - all through a simple piece of utility.<br><br>-T. Ryan, Dept. of Personnel, DOGA Archivist</p>

            <p>((I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I&#39;m handing the actual work of reviewing off to Terri. She&#39;s more interesting than me))<br><br><b>From the Personal Files of Terri Ryan, Department of Personnel</b><br><br>Everyone in DOGA (or DoGA, or DGA, or the Pyro Department, or whatever we&#39;re calling it this week) keeps telling me I need to get a hobby. Actually they usually tell me I need to get a life, but since I spend every waking hour filing their mission reports, complaints and sundries (a word I have come to detest), a hobby is the best I can do. Actually I shouldn&#39;t even be doing this, but I have an excuse. A package of old mission reports from across the PPC was delivered to the Archives this morning for some unknown reason, and I need to read them all to figure out what&#39;s going on. Since I&#39;m doing that, I figure I might as well review them too.<br><br>Mission: <a href="http://rc5593.webs.com/suebusters.htm">Suebusters/For Gondor and Rohan</a><br>Agents: Cara Fielding &amp; Miriam Collins, DMS<br><br>I have to say I found this mission a little dull to read about (although I note that one of the agents involved said much the same thing - I suppose boring is better than fatally exciting, right?). The main reason for this is that all the interesting moments appear to be glossed over. For example, during the Council I read that <i>the entire courtyard turn[ed] gold</i> when the &#39;Sue appeared. From Miriam&#39;s next line, I inferred that this was due to a line of bad narrative - but I am given no clue as to what it was. This happens every time Suvian prose is invoked. She gives a Sue-like description of the Lady Galadriel, but again, I don&#39;t get to find out what it says.<br><br>The main issue I have with this is that pure agent reaction doesn&#39;t hold my interest very well. I want to be entertained, and I want to be able to laugh at the badfic myself. There is little worse than seeing someone else in stitches over a joke I haven&#39;t heard. I understand the agents&#39; purpose, I think - they want to be the focus, not simply characters in an MST - but I believe they would be more interesting if we knew what they were reacting to, not simply how.<br><br>Another issue I noticed is one I shall be passing on to the Department of Redundancy Department: lacking anything from the badfic to describe, the narrative sometimes takes to narrating the agents&#39; dialogue. For example:<br><i>While it was understandable given the plagiarism, 0% OOC readings across the board (with the exception of the Sue, of course) were still unusual.<br><br>&quot;Huh, everyone&#39;s totally in character so far,&quot; she noted, raising an eyebrow at the CAD with a small amount of disbelief. &quot;That&#39;s strange.&quot;</i><br><br>The rule of &#39;Show, don&#39;t tell&#39; seems to have been altered by these agents into &#39;show and tell&#39;. Wait, was that too harsh? I&#39;ve not exactly practiced this. I think the actual issue is one of &#39;Who knows what and how&#39;: the CAD informs one agent of an occurance, and that agent tells her partner. The problem is, both events didn&#39;t need to be narrated. It broke the flow of the mission for me. Even if this is what actually happened, to quote another rule, sometimes &#39;Less is more&#39;. The dialogue would suffice, here and in other areas.<br><br>There is also an issue with narrative tension - or the lack thereof. Despite the agents&#39; repeated warnings about the &#39;Sue possibly hearing them, there seems to be no danger of this happening. In one scene, Miriam taunts the Laws of Narrative Comedy - and wins. At a time when most of the Fellowship are on high alert due to approaching crebain, she sneaks into their camp, ignoring a warning from her partner, and steals their food with no consequences. Cara is alarmed, but does nothing, and nothing ever comes of the event.<br><br>Cara&#39;s warning was perfect foreshadowing, a Chekov&#39;s gun that simply didn&#39;t fire. Miriam wasn&#39;t seen. I understand that this is an accurate representation of events, but it left me feeling distinctly unsatisfied. There are two ways it could have been improved. The whole incident could have been downplayed, rather than building it up for no payoff. Alternately, and preferably, the tension could have been ramped up. If the narrative had followed Miriam rather than staying with Cara, we could have experienced her feelings: did that rock just move? I can&#39;t see Aragorn from here! <i>What was that noise?</i><br><br>I hope I can be forgiven for my bad form in describing all the negatives first. I do not do this lightly - the structure of a review is practically a sacred trust - but as any member of the R&amp;R Division of Personnel will tell you, sometimes structure must be sacrificed to dramatic necessity. The positives here are something rarely seen in mission reports, and in my opinion they far outweigh all that has gone before.<br><br>At the very beginning of the mission, we are shown Miriam&#39;s dislike for the cold. This seems to be a piece of scene-setting, with no lasting consequences - until the agents arrive at Caradhras. Here the cold issue resurfaces, and (without spoiling my second positive) leads to interaction that would not otherwise occur.<br><br>I admire the narrative consistancy shown here. A major issue with badfics is a failure to carry things forward: a wrist broken in one scene may be used to loose a bow a dozen chapters later. Here the agents, through careful use of the narrative structure, managed to create a small plot arc within their tale. It allowed me to connect more fully with the agents - to see them as people, not merely vessels for the plot. And then there&#39;s Ring Bearer...<br><br>Ring Bearer the mini-Balrog is almost a special case of the above, but he is even better used. These days minis are often ignored - they appear in one scene, then vanish, just like that broken wrist. Not Ring Bearer. I&#39;ll illustrate this with three paragraphs from widely-separated parts of the report:<br><br><i>Even though she wasn&#39;t usually fond of minis, Miriam almost squealed in relief, huddling just close enough to Ring Bearer for the convection to warm her without causing severe burns; warmth was one thing, being incinerated was another.<br><br>She looked around in concern for somewhere to put Ring Bearer, as - without meaning to - the mini-Balrog was starting to char the wood. In the end she asked him to wait at the bottom of the tree, where he wouldn&#39;t be able to set anything alight. Mournfully, the little Maia did as requested, though he was pacified with a promise of more bacon later.<br><br>A few clicks and whirrs and a bright flash of light later, Ring Bearer looked rather puzzled. In place of the Uruk-Hai that had picked him up, two female Elves - still wearing the same clothes - stood adjusting their backpacks. “Hey, it’s okay,” Cara grinned at him, throwing him their last piece of bacon to reassure him...</i><br><br>From his first appearence, this mini is not just something that happened: he becomes an integral part of the mission. The problems and advantages of dealing with a demi-angelic ball of flame are addressed: he is used for warmth on Caradhras, and later gently removed from the flet in Lorien - we even see his reactions to this. Later still, I read of his reaction to a change of disguise, and I realised this was what had been missing.<br><br>I read a mission for two reasons: to delight at the tale of agents cleaning out a badfic, and to see something new. The entertainment of the former was somewhat muted here, but, for the first time in a long time, something brand new appeared. I have never seen a mini become a character on its first appearance before - and I enjoyed it immensely. It shows how much respect the two agents have for the Word Worlds they enter, and for the creatures they encounter. By reading about their interactions with Ring Bearer, I came to truly believe that the authors were lovers of Canon, not just haters of &#39;Sues. And that is something I always treasure.<br><br>-T.

            <p>(Don&#39;t really care about winning, I&#39;m just happy to be participating.)<br><br>A review of our solitary <i>Indiana Jones</i> mission by Chatvert:<br><a href="http://wizkit.livejournal.com/904.html"><a href="http://wizkit.livejournal.com/904.html">http://wizkit.livejournal.com/904.html</a></a><br>which I tried to post there, but LJ wants . . . stuff.  Or something.  Which might be for the best, because this review feels disgustingly long to me.<br><br>&quot;Greetings! Fellow PPCer doctorlit here. When I noticed we had an <i>Indiana Jones</i> mission, I just had to come read it!<br><br><i>Indiana Jones</i> had a lot of fun minor characters (Sallah and Brody, in particular), and they got shafted pretty heavily by this badfic. I&#39;m glad you had Kitty react to that, and gave them a bit of fan-love through her dialogue.<br><br>Kitty and Alec work very well as a PPC partnership. I especially like their dialogue. It&#39;s been a while since the agent banter in a mission kept me smiling most of the way through my reading. Alec&#39;s serious pragmatism conflicts well with Kitty&#39;s fannish excitement towards everything. At the same time, I like that both agents can slip out of their usual characterization, like when Alec references the <i>Last Crusade</i> dialogue during the assassination. Another example where this shines through is Kitty&#39;s reaction to being shot, immediately calming down so she could take care of herself.<br><br>One thing that made this mission a somewhat difficult read was that your writing and the badfic&#39;s writing shared the same formatting (except the bolded author&#39;s notes). With no obvious visual difference, there were paragraphs that seemed to be part of your narration, but turned out to be from the badfic as I read more. I don&#39;t know what formatting livejournal allows, but it would make for a much smoother, clearer read if you bolded or italicized the badfic quotes. This is especially important with a badfic like this one that has mostly decent SPaG.<br><br>I thought it was kind of weird for Alec Trevelyan (who our wiki tells me is from <i>James Bond</i>) to be casting magic spells. I went back and read his first mission to find out why he was capable of doing so, but there was no mention of magic at all. In fact, Kitty didn&#39;t display any magic there, either. It&#39;s pretty random for this magical talent to have just been dropped on the reader in the second installment of your spinoff with no explanation, even apart from the weirdness of a <i>James Bond</i> canon being able to do it at all.<br><br>Between this mission and that first one, I also noticed another contradiction. Kitty can barely assassinate the Bourneverse Sue without having an emotional breakdown, and admits she only managed it because she knew Alec was in danger. Then, in the beginning of this mission, Kitty is very nonchalant about picking out a weapon and says she is &quot;getting used to&quot; killing. It&#39;s very jarring to go from one mission to the next and have this complete turnaround in attitude. I realize I&#39;m probably meant to assume other missions took place between these two, but it would have been a lot more satisfying to see that change in Kitty happen over time, because as it is, it feels like I&#39;ve missed out on a huge chunk of Kitty&#39;s character development. That change, as well as the magic thing, should to be shown to the reader, rather than briefly mentioned as having occurred during the &quot;commercial break.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sorry this comment went on so long, especially on a two-year-old entry. Just wanted to give my thoughts on a mission in an awesome, but sadly neglected, canon.<br>—doctorlit</p>

Again, I&#39;ve lumped the last two paragraphs together. In this case, it&#39;s because no solution was given for the problem presented in the second-to-last paragraph, but the solution in the last one is explicitly applied to both. The problems for the reader seem to apply to both, as well, so all in all it&#39;s a good discussion.<br><br>TOTAL: 10 points.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I am not going to participate in the actual contest portion of this, as I am married to the judge, and that is prize enough for me.  I will, however, still be reviewing things and I welcome Neshomeh to judge how many points I would receive, as an example of how the system works.<br><br>That said, here is my first review.<br><br>---------<br><br>Phobos&#39; review of <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/architeuthis/mission01.html">Architeuthis, Mission 1: The Beginning</a>:<br><br>I&#39;m not quite sure how to begin this, so I guess the best thing to do is get out my thoughts on the piece overall.  I&#39;m sad to say I didn&#39;t really enjoy it.  There are several reasons for that.<br><br>The first half of this mission was one long info-dump that tries to set out exactly what the PPC is, and how it does its job.  While this is useful information, it was not presented in a way that was interesting to read, and I found it difficult to trudge through it.  Since it was obviously intended for readers who were not familiar with the PPC, I wouldn&#39;t advocate getting rid of it all together.  I think it would have been better to put it in a separate piece and liven it up somehow.  Perhaps make it more of a more fully developed story about how Architeuthis joined the organization and found these things out, rather than explaining it directly to the audience and quoting sections of the manual.<br><br>Another problem I had with this particular mission was the lack of clear delineation between sections.  The disclaimer at the top runs directly into the exposition section, which runs directly into the actual narrative.  It is jarring, and it only serves to confuse the reader.  This is a simple fix, though.  A horizontal rule between the sections would clear that up easily.<br><br>There are, what appear to be, several in-text author&#39;s notes, which I believe are a lazy way to get information to the audience.  Two, in particular, caught my eye.<br><br>1) <i>(I&#39;m a graduate student of biology; I need money, okay?)</i>  This information has no bearing on the story, and, due to agents not getting paid, doesn&#39;t make any sense as a reason to join the PPC.  If you really wanted to get this into the story, I would recommend writing a more thorough introduction of Architeuthis, which includes her being a graduate student, and what that means for her in her new job.<br><br>2) <i>(Of course, I&#39;d picked a fake name before coming....)</i>  This one makes a common mistake.  You are telling, rather than showing.  It would have been more interesting and less intrusive if we had seen the agent pick the name as part of her preparations for going out.  Perhaps she could have a number of names on a dartboard, or something.  &quot;Show; don&#39;t tell&quot; would be good advice for this piece as a whole, come to think of it.<br><br>It is quite obvious that you know what you are talking about when it comes to Lord of the Rings canon.  Some specific instances are the <i>palantiri</i> and the Black Shadow.  I was under the mistaken impression that there were only four <i>palantiri.</i>  I learned something today.<br><br>I don&#39;t feel that it was adequately explained how Architeuthis managed to make it through this without a scratch.  She fully admitted to being a spy, and she was in the heart of Minas Morgul.  That would have warranted torture, at the very least, to find out how she had made it so far into the fortress undetected.  It seems particularly out of character for the Witch King.  He seemed to not care a whole lot that this person was in his tower, playing with his <i>palantir.</i>  It would have been more interesting if Architeuthis needed to do something more than just tell the truth to get out of the situation.<br><br>As a side-note, while we are on the subject of the Witch King, Makes-Things just modified the Neuralyzers to work on undead, and we don&#39;t hear about it until the it was being used?  That smacks of plot contrivance and lazy storytelling.  I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t modify the equipment.  What I am saying is that you need to work at setting things like that up, in advance, so that they don&#39;t come out of thin air.  If Makes-Things, or someone else from DoSAT had given Architeuthis the modified, possibly even experimental, Neuralyzer earlier in the story, it would have been far less jarring.<br><br>All in all, I&#39;m sorry to say that this doesn&#39;t make me keen to read any further into the adventures of Architeuthis.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to try to run through it as efficiently as possible, without rambling. Let&#39;s see how it goes.<br><br>1) Info-dump - 2 points. Lays out the problem of a dry presentation of facts dragging down the piece for readers who are already familiar with the PPC, and provides a recommendation of working the information in more organically. However, could be clearer about what specifically about this presentation makes it dry and uninteresting.<br><br>2) Formatting - 3 points. A simple problem with a simple solution.<br><br>3) In-text author&#39;s notes - 3 points. The problem is clearly explained, specific examples and specific recommendations provided.<br><br>4) Canon knowledge - 1 point. I assume this is a compliment, and the what and why are present if I also assume learning something is why this information is good (perhaps not easy for the author, given the criticism of the info-dump; presumably the difference is that the reader didn&#39;t learn anything from the info-dump?). However, there&#39;s no discussion of the impact this knowledge has on the reader&#39;s experience of the story. This could have been said in response to a blog or Facebook comment.<br><br>5) Plot contrivances - 3 points. I&#39;m counting the last two paragraphs under the same heading here, because they seem to work as two examples of the same issue (things being a bit too convenient). They&#39;re both clear demonstrations of how things working out too easily for the protagonist makes for a lack of story tension and reader disappointment, and in each case a recommendation is given for improvement.<br><br>TOTAL: 12 points.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Me and a couple of engineering geeks made a trebuchet. Just so we&#39;re clear, this is not a &quot;cute&quot; balsa wood affair- the pivot is five feet off the ground, the arm is ten feet in length, and the sling is an additional three. The weight box is designed to hold ~375 pounds. However, we have a bit of a problem. We can&#39;t decide what to name the damn thing. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>There was some tricky, serious dialogue in this interlude.  It&#39;s difficult to get characters talking when they&#39;re all trying to dance around a problem like this, but I think you handled it well and kept everyone&#39;s lines realistic.<br><br>I also liked the dream sequence opening.  The details were very vivid, which brought to life, for me, why it was so harrowing for Cindy.<br><br>Now, uh . . . I&#39;m a little disappointed in Xanthus and Anneli for never thinking to bring Cindy to FicPsych.  I understand them wanting to take care of her on her own, and I realize she would have resisted every step of the way.  However, I still think the other two agents should have at least brought it up as a possibility.  It just seems a little overly stubborn to me that they never even discuss trying to get Cindy there.<br><br>Finally, some mistakes I caught:<br><br><br>A &quot;to&quot; is missing from here somewhere.  (strive not to repeat)<br><br>The ending . . . uh, greater than sign?  Andalite . . . talky . . . thingy.  Is, uh, missing.  Off the end there. (&gt;)<br><br>(Wow.  The Board does not like Andalite dialogue.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m kind of surprised it never occurred to <i>me</i> to get FicPsych involved, now that you mention it. On the other hand, though, even if I knew a friend of mine was having trouble, if they wouldn&#39;t talk to me about it I&#39;m not sure my next reaction would be &quot;okay then, I must make them get therapy.&quot; That&#39;s kind of a personal decision, and making a suggestion like that to someone who&#39;s already in a sensitive state might alienate them even further.<br><br>I mean, if it looked like Cindy was suicidal or otherwise likely to harm herself, then yeah, they should have called for help, but that wasn&#39;t the case.

            <p>I guess for me, the whole torture-of-a-friend thing would feel like something I couldn&#39;t deal with on my own, so my instinct would have been to turn to FicPsych.

            <p>I think that&#39;s definitely valid, but I don&#39;t know that it applies to Xanthus and Anneli. The fact that it doesn&#39;t come up in the narrative may be an issue—something to point out that they just never thought of it, and why, mightn&#39;t have gone amiss, though I don&#39;t personally find it necessary—but I think a case can be made for any psychological reaction you can think of. I&#39;m taking issue with judging the characters as people rather than judging the narrative choice. Does that make sense?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, the dialogue gave me a bit of a hard time with trying to make it flow naturally, especially as it got closer to Cindy and Ilraen&#39;s conversation.<br><br>Hm... I&#39;ll admit I never thought about FicPsych and how they&#39;d fit in until the neuralyzation bit involving Thane. So blame that on me.

            <p>Name: Anna Beilschmidt. Name she was born with is Moonracer Roxanne Beilschmidt, due to Extremely Bad Parenting. She HATES it.<br>Appearance: Chin-length white hair, ghastly pale skin, and red eyes. She&#39;s half-albino, half-vampire, and dangit, it does NOT look good. Wears thick, black glasses, and suits with skirts. Her left leg is twisted, due to a tragic accident in the gene pool... She can&#39;t really put any weight on it. She has to wear a brace and use a cane; if she&#39;s travelling any distance, she uses a wheelchair.<br>Personality: Arrogant, a wee bit sarcastic, logical, and a *bit* of a Flat Earth Atheist. In short, your average Agent. Tends to try to take charge of things. Even when other people don&#39;t want her to. Speaks both French and German, and curses fluently in the latter. Takes copious notes of things that happen in a black Moleskine. Just a wee bit anal-retentive. Yells at people a lot. She takes after Hetalia-Germany more than her father.<br>Parentage: Prussia (APH) is her father, Sabine (VtM OC) is her mother.<br></p>

            <p>As with most concepts, I think this one could go really well or it could be a mess, depending on how it&#39;s handled in-context. I have some questions to that effect, not necessarily to be answered now, but to think about. They pretty much all boil down to &quot;why is this important?&quot;, but I&#39;ll specify:<br><br>1) First and foremost, she&#39;s disabled. If you&#39;re planning for her to be a field agent, how are you going to handle that? If the disguise generator fixes it so she can get around all right, then what is the point of having her be crippled in the first place; but on the other hand, if it doesn&#39;t, how will she face physical challenges that may arise? I think the latter option is a more interesting choice, but it does present potential pitfalls. If she literally can&#39;t carry her weight in the story, how long will it <i>stay</i> interesting?<br><br>1.2) Similar questions about her being an albino/vampire. Does she burn up and die in the sunlight? Does she crave blood? In short, how will this affect her, and how will she cope with it? If the only downside is cosmetic and it won&#39;t challenge her at all in the course of the spin-off, why bother including it?<br><br>2) Her personality: how have all her traits and history led to it? How did she get to be an arrogant, take-charge person with all the physical, physiological, and presumably psychological obstacles she faces? Parental encouragement, good friends, that one really awesome teacher...? How does it all fit together?<br><br>3) The name: is there any reason why her parent(s) chose Moonracer Roxanne, and is it ever going to come up? If not, how much is she going to harp on about it anyway? If a lot, it will be annoying. If not at all, why not just have her be named Anna?<br><br>And that&#39;s pretty much it. None of this is meant to be discouraging, but just as some stuff to think about. It&#39;s okay to have things about a character that just are (Nume has green glasses because that&#39;s the only decent option I could find when I first used a dollmaker to do an image of him), but the big, stand-out things need to have a reason behind them and a function in your storytelling. Heck, even the little things tend to grow significance over time (Nume&#39;s favorite color is green—he&#39;s human enough to <i>have</i> a favorite color), so make sure they&#39;re things that make sense. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>1-1.2. The bad leg could be a bit of a problem, yes. I mostly put that in there to cancel out the dhampir superpowers. Dhampir are stronger, faster, and so on than your average human. And I didn&#39;t want Anna to be little-miss-half-vampire-Sue. So she has about half the drawbacks of being a vampire, none of the benefits, and a whole NOTHER set of problems on top of that.<br>Benefits: A little more resilient to cuts, bruises, etc. than average. That&#39;s about it. <br>Drawbacks: Does, indeed, crave blood. Does NOT burn in sunlight, but has very weak eyes- sort of like a drow elf. Since her body is trying to behave as if it&#39;s alive and dead at the same time, her mitochondria don&#39;t really work properly and her immune system is shot. She gets tired EXTREMELY easily, picks up every disease that comes along the pike, and generally is (physically) a HUGE liability. In the RP canon we had her in, she also dies young, because her body just can&#39;t take the strain anymore. Like, I think in our main storyline, she barely makes it to 30. And... I think it&#39;s definitely a challenge to her, because of all this crap.<br> The OTHER thing is, she&#39;s the kid of two RP characters. Prussia from Hetalia and a (female- NO mpreg kthxbai) vampire. You know the type. *sigh* It seemed like a good idea at the time. So that&#39;s the ooc explication for why.<br><br>2. Ooh, this is the hard one. &gt;.&gt; Lol. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got... She&#39;s the daughter of PRUSSIA and the niece of GERMANY. Stubbornness, assertiveness, and such runs in the family as is. (They&#39;re nations, they&#39;re horribly stereotypical.) Anna is actually, by her (nuclear) family&#39;s standards, kind of shy and a wallflower... She had to learn to get loud FAST, or she got drowned out. Anna really wants people to take her seriously (a lot of smart girls do), and her odd appearance doesn&#39;t help. Since she&#39;s still fairly young (about 16), she thinks that being loud and assertive and such will HELP people take her seriously and think she&#39;s interesting and important. Her Uncle Luddy- That&#39;s Germany, for you Hetalia fans- also encouraged this, because he was sort of training her as a soldier. She really looks up to him... her dad&#39;s a bit crazy and unreliable, and her mum&#39;s even worse. Germany is at least stable, and normal, and sane... worryingly so, he&#39;s saner than Jeremy Clockson, but she likes the normalcy.<br><br>3. Moonracer = Her dad was a HUGE Transformers nut. Her older brother is named &#39;Megatron Fritz Beilschmidt&#39;. If she was a little boy, she would have gotten named &#39;Starscream&#39;. As is, Moonracer was the only female Transformer I could find in ten minutes of googling. It&#39;s not going to come up too much, she might allude to &#39;even MY real name&#39;s not that bad&#39; at a particularly speshul Suename... UNLESS they get sent on a mission to a Transformers fic. Then she&#39;s going to die a little inside, the way that (say) Acacia dies a little inside when sent into a Borimir hatefic. She LOATHES Transformers with EVERY. FIBRE. OF HER BEING.<br><br>Forgot. Her fandoms:<br>Axis Powers Hetalia, sort of. She started out as a sort of side character from that fandom, and she&#39;s very... protective of the characters. Especially Germany, Prussia, and Old Fritz. She LOATHES Germancest and sporks it every chance she gets. &#39;Cos, you know, it&#39;s her DAD and her UNCLE.<br><br>The Neverending Story. This book was her childhood; she loves it to death. It was her favorite growing up, and, yes, she has a bit of a fangirl crush on Atreyu. More to the point, there&#39;s LOADS of bad Neverending Story fic out there that needs to be burned with fire.<br></p>

            <p>I can&#39;t really picture her as a field agent. From what you write, I doubt that she would be sent out. I don&#39;t think she could chase after runaway characters, for example.

            <p>What occured to me: APH. I don&#39;t know that much about it, but I doubt any of the characters were huge Transformers nuts. What you describe sounds more like badfic versions of the canons involved. I mean, there is already a noncanon vampire involved, so...<br><br>Can anyone here validate how IC Germany and Prussia are in that description?

            <p>It&#39;s a pretty commmonly held piece of fanon that Prussia likes Transformers, from what I can tell. Just like it&#39;s a commonly held piece of fanon in the Potterverse that Beauxbatons is a girls&#39; school and Durmstrang is a boy&#39;s school, even though in the books there&#39;s boys and girls from both schools.

            <p>Well... Okay, really bad comparison, I was just trying to think of something that&#39;s as wide-spread. It&#39;s more like... Um... Like ScoRose or something. IDK.<br><br>...Thing is, in-canon, one of Prussia&#39;s friends is Japan. (They&#39;re both Axis Powers, and they both have a penchant for random cute things. This is canon.) So the idea is, Japan got Prussia into Transformers, too. <br><br>...Sadly, yes. Yes, he is. This is the guy who... Well, the word &#39;doitsbag&#39; was NOT coined for Germany. He refers to his &#39;vital regions&#39; *ahem* as his &#39;five meters&#39;. Often. In mixed company. He likes to harass people. Especially his brother, and Hungary and Austria, either of which may be his romantic interests. He lives in his brother&#39;s basement, and only comes out to bother/annoy various people. <br><br>So yes... it is TOTALLY in character to give his kids MORONIC names, just to be a troll.</p>

            <p>You have to realize there is a big difference between &quot;harassing people and being annoying&quot; or &quot;bragging about penis size&quot; and &quot;mentally scarring one&#39;s own non-canon children for life because of some fanon&quot;. And yes, I know APH (canon, not fanon) well enough to say this.<br><br>The thing is that what you&#39;re saying sounds dangerously close to the excuses the authors of the badfic the PPC usually targets make a lot of the time to justify the bad ideas they stuff into their stories - just because a theory is popular in fandom, or because you really want a character to act this way, doesn&#39;t mean that the character won&#39;t act completely OOC.<br><br>Another thing that kind of worries me is your stance on shipping you mentioned in your introduction thread - you ship characters, even though you don&#39;t even know the canon they&#39;re from well enough? That&#39;s (at least in my opinion) not a very good thing to do - you should at least know the relationships between canon characters and the context they&#39;re in before you attempt to haphazardly put characters together.<br><br>Your agent is not very suited to be a PPC agent - both because you apparently try so hard to cancel out the traits that make her special with forced weaknesses that she essentially becomes useless as a field agent, and she also becomes more speshul that way than if you just left her as a normal dhampir. You say that you read the Original Series as well as the Wiki, but I still have the feeling that you don&#39;t really get what the PPC is actually about yet.<br><br>&quot;Liking a canon&quot; and &quot;knowing a canon enough to differentiate canon from fanon&quot; are two different things, and you often need to do extensive research into a canon in order to recognize when something violates canon - even if it means sinking ships or letting go of fanon you really loved. I know it&#39;s hard to detach yourself emotionally from a fanon theory you really became attached to, but if it goes beyond &quot;it&#39;s all in good fun&quot; into &quot;the character doesn&#39;t act OOC because of this fanon&quot;, it gets a little worrisome.<br><br>I apologize if I sound harsh or cruel when saying all of the above, but this is something one needs to keep in mind when approaching a canon, especially one you are very fond of.</p>

            <p>EF and Flare, I&#39;m not disagreeing with any of the points you&#39;re making, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to be nicer about it. Less ordering and declaring, more recommending and opining would do for a start, and if you feel the need to apologize for potential harshness, that&#39;s probably a good sign that you should take a step back and edit before posting. AnnaBee&#39;s been quite reasonable about discussing this character, and she&#39;s clearly put thought into it, even if it doesn&#39;t necessarily hold up, so let&#39;s be reasonable in return.

            <p>Her origin, as much as you described it, is an issue you never really got to.<br><br>Her father and uncle, are, I&#39;m sure different in canon than they are in a cracky crossover RP.

            <p>Most Definitely Canon: The &#39;five meters&#39; thing. *shudder* The friends with France thing. The pestering people thing. The friends with Japan thing. The &#39;cute things&#39; thing. In canon, he actually has a little pet bird that lives in his hair. xD<br><br>Ambiguously Canon: The &#39;lives in his brother&#39;s basement&#39; thing. History backs this one up (which is pretty much canon for Hetalia. You know how it is.) and so does Prussia&#39;s &#39;official blog&#39;. The show only goes until 1940-something, but Prussia isn&#39;t a country anymore. So, we know he&#39;s still around, because of the author-created official blog. But no one quite knows how. So the fandom cracks jokes about how he lives in Germany&#39;s basement.<br><br>The definite fanon: Any romantic pairings (it&#39;s always just heavily implied), the Transformers thing.</p>

            <p>Ok, here&#39;s the bottom line. It has been nearly 3 - 4 months since I had selected the work I had in mind to spork - a work which had been since deleted from FF.Net one month into my attempted sporking. Owing to PPC guidelines if it takes too long, as well as the frustrating length of the damn thing (covering ALL THREE books/films of LOTR), I am considering pulling out now and starting from scratch with a, hopefully, shorter work.<br><br>Suggestions?</p>

            <p>There are mainly two kind of fics PPC-wise.<br><br>Those with which you can have fun, and those who just don&#39;t work (with you. Maybe others will be able to make a good mission out of it, since everybody has his own mission style).<br><br>For example, I tend to be picky when searching for a sporkable fic. Why?<br><br>Because not all the fics go well with my mission-writing style.<br><br>I just finished an extensive research in Card Captor Sakura, and I ended up choosing an hurt/comfort one. Not actually from grammar and writing (in fact, technical charges are completely absent) but because the plot was flimsy at best (Syaoran being blind for no reason at all, for example, and three Generic Rapists with no brain whatsoever. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget Healing Sex.)<br><br>I had to pass several other fics because all of them didn&#39;t suit for my writing at all:<br><br>- One was seventeen chapters long. It would have took me too much time to read all of it, and I tend to pace better missions in short ones.<br>- One was <i>too</i> squicky. You will not get summary or links from me, I&#39;m still shivering. Despite the fact that I want that... that... <i>thing</i> deader than dead, I&#39;m not going to prod it with a mile-long pole.<br>- Others were probably trolls, and too short for even a MST. Besides that, no fun potential.<br>- The last one is on my kill-list, but there aren&#39;t enough chapters yet to write a good mission. I have to wait a while.<br><br>So, if you don&#39;t feel like sporking it anymore, just give it up and search something different. Reember, it&#39;s not a job - we&#39;re here to have fun.</p>

            <p>Well, there are multiple problems in my case, but SP&amp;G isn&#39;t it.<br><br>The sheer length is one of the biggest concerns as the author-inserted char- I mean, Lucie, last of the &quot;angeli&quot; (none of whom exist in Middle-Earth)goes throughout the ENTIRE course of the LOTR canon (minus Sam and Frodo post-Falls of Raos.).<br><br>Componding it, to be perfectly honest, when we peel back the canon, the &quot;supporting&quot; canons, the fictional and downright heretical history and &quot;specul powerz&quot; of Lucie, what do you have?

            <p>Maybe you could have your agents accidentally derail the plot somehow- things go Horribly Wrong and the canon characters notice- and they have to join forces with Sauron to wipe this plague off the face of the Earth? Well, Middle-earth?<br><br>Or summat. <br><br>*newbie is new*</p>

            <p>As this Sue has already killed (not banished, KILLED) two Ringwraiths within the space of two chapters INCLUDING THE WITCH-KING HIMSELF!!<br><br>If the most powerful of Sauron&#39;s lieutenants cannot stand up to this Sue on a good day, I most certainly doubt a Helghast and a young adult from the 21st century would.

            <p>First, I agree with Aster: if it&#39;s too huge and it&#39;s not fun anymore, best just to let it go. I also made the mistake of trying to take something too big for me when I was new, and even though I was working with a co-writer, it still ended up dying unfinished. Start small.<br><br>That said, though, there are possibilities even when dealing with a massively overpowered Sue. The first question to ask is, is she really that powerful, or has she somehow nerfed the other characters? What if those weren&#39;t real Ringwraiths she killed, just shadow-puppets she pulled in to puff herself up? In that case, the <i>real</i> Ringwraiths are probably stuck in a plothole, and they&#39;re probably pissed off and would be more than willing to show her what one of the Nine can really do.<br><br>On the other hand, there was a Nazgul recovering in FicPsych once, so it&#39;s also possible she directly de-powered them for the same purpose. Either way, though, she&#39;s still not as strong as she wants us to think she is. Disrespecting canonical bad guys does not a strong, powerful character make.<br><br>&#39;Course, if the story is written well enough that you believe she <i>is</i> that powerful, then perhaps it&#39;s not as bad as all that. That&#39;s also something to consider.<br><br>It&#39;s all hypothetical, of course, but the point is there&#39;s always more than one approach to things. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>*stumbles in, unneeded glasses askew and wearing pyjamas*<br><br> Well, it seems everyone else has already gotten around to it, but I&#39;ll say it too anyway. Welcome, newcomer! Have some Bleep-products!<br><br> Well, this is the initiation, really. We all flock and greet you, throw you Bleep-products, Pith Helmets, and, in the case of Turtle, hydrophobic water. Whatever you do, don&#39;t drink the hydrophobic water. Bad idea is bad.<br><br> Well, you might want to read the Original Series first. That&#39;s your canon, so pay close attention. If you&#39;re not a LotR fan, I suggest the wiki. You won&#39;t learn as much or as well, but it serves as a substitute. It also contains links to many other PPC works.<br><br> If you love Redwall, I would suggest talking to Burnsie (Laburnum Steelfang). Ze&#39;s working with Kit to write an OFU, and may also answer to Hemlock, which is a male self. Hence the gender neutral pronoun. Ze&#39;s also good for Welkin Weasels, Discworld, and other semi-obscure fandoms. Also operates in Penguins of Madagascar.<br><br> If you&#39;re into My Little Pony, I&#39;m just one of a good number you can talk to. It is as the show says- &quot;Friendship is Magic&quot;. And there&#39;s a lot of it to be offered here. The boarder who write Fritz and Silias is also a Brony, last I checked. Ze was the brave being who tackled &quot;Cupcakes&quot;.<br><br> A good boarder to talk to for just about anything is HerrWozzeck. Ze&#39;s pretty cool.<br><br> I would also like to say wait a while before firing a Permission Request. I remember filing mine too damn early and it was rejected because I wasn&#39;t well known enough. I still haven&#39;t filed a second one- partly because I lost the doc, and partly because I&#39;ve been active in a rather sparodic manner of late.<br><br> All the best, AnnaBee!</p>

I also don&#39;t know much about Pokemon, South Park, or Durarara, but I ship a few pairings from them. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>I ship compulsively- straight, yaoi, and even occasionally yuri. I am also guilty of creating cracky crossovers so bad that even the Department of Crossovers can&#39;t make head or tail of them. It&#39;s all in RP, so it makes a certain degree of sense at the time, but... I&#39;m also fond of crossing fandoms that SHOULD NOT be crossed, like Sherlock Holmes and South Park. And then shipping characters from the crossed fandoms. Hey, at least I&#39;ve got an Agent now who can help me fix this, right?</p>
