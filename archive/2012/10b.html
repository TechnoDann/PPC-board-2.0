            <p>The two unnamed agents were fairly well characterized, which was one thing that I know is a problem with unnamed characters sometimes. <br><br>I noticed you had a lot of &quot;as if&quot; statements, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but something to be mindful of, because it affects your tone and your pacing without you realizing it. It makes statements less definite, and it can take the punch out of a paragraph. <br><br>However, if it were up to me, I&#39;d hand you the internet and say go for it. Especially because skimming that sporkable fic is beginning to annoy me, less because of any specific errors than because the entire thing seems like it was barfed out at two a. m. without any respect for canon. </p>

            <p>The unnamed agents are unnamed because... well... their only purpose is to bring Will to the PPC. Perhaps they&#39;ll do something else one day.<br><br>Until I read your comment, I really had no idea how often I was doing that, which is odd because I&#39;m usually a stickler for not using the same word or phrase twice in close proximity with one another. I believe it was the result of wanting to describe ridiculous things as nonchalantly as possible.  </p>

            <p>Hmmm... yeah, I can see that, but using it more than occasionally, at least in third person omniscient dialogue, is something that I usually catch on to and am distracted by really quick. I figure an omniscient narrator can afford to give definite statements because they really do know what&#39;s going on.</p>

            <p>I love your Agents; they have a wonderful dynamic and a great description, and I&#39;m delighted to see another Potterverse semi-fic blip recruit around. (For info on at least one of the others, check out Agent William Marshall.) Will Rose in particular has definitely caught my interest and I&#39;d like to see more about him.<br><br>As for your Permission piece, I liked it as far as it went, but it&#39;s a very short piece - I think it could have done to be a little longer, maybe going into more depth about the situation after they recruited Will. I also noticed a few minor things your beta-reader didn&#39;t catch. For example:<br><br><i>&quot;Hmm,&quot; the man looked thoughtful.</i> should have been <i>&quot;Hmm.&quot; The man looked thoughtful.</i> because a comma at the end of speech marks indicates that the speaker&#39;s next action will relate to having said something (i.e. spoke, murmured, yelled).<br><br><i>Then, with no warning whatsoever, he announced &quot;I REALLY HOPE THAT THE VILLAIN DOESN’T COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND FIND US SOON, BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE OUR LIVES RATHER MISERABLE!&quot;</i><br><br>Here, you missed out the comma before the opening speech mark (it should have gone after &quot;announced&quot;).<br><br>And there are a few other very small errors here and there. I&#39;d like to ask that you take another look, maybe get a secondary beta in (because two heads are always better than one). I would also love to see this piece expanded somewhat. It&#39;s a very short piece, so it&#39;s hard to get an idea of how you&#39;ll manage with longer ones.<br><br>So in my opinion, Permission temporarily denied, sad as I am to say it. Polish things up a bit and I&#39;ll be more than happy to take another look. I do hope you&#39;ll take my recommendations on board; your writing&#39;s very enjoyable, and I would like to see it become better.</p>

            <p>All right. I have to admit, grammar is not my forte and the piece is short, but of the stuff I have written right now, it&#39;s the only one that&#39;s finished without being horribly dark and/or depressing. </p>

            <p>Hello! Some of you will remember a thread with a similar title awhile back, but if you don&#39;t, you can find the original with the explanation of what this is about <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=224576">here</a>.<br><br>Anyway, the news is that the agent pages in the Department of Floaters category have now been completely edited for treatment of titles and general formatting-and-consistency things (and it didn&#39;t even take me all year!). I&#39;ve also de-bolded the ones that needed it, cleaning up the mess I made for myself by not learning to fix things with CSS a long time ago.<br><br>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, please don&#39;t screw it up. Especially with the titles and mission links. If you&#39;re confused about anything I&#39;ve done and the above linked post doesn&#39;t help, please ask, and I&#39;ll be happy to explain things. Just please, please use those critical observation skills I know you all have and follow precedent. Please.<br><br>From here, I&#39;ll probably be de-bolding other agent pages working backward alphabetically by department, and moving forward alphabetically with my regular editing. Next up: Department of Geographical Aberrations.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you had Caroline own up to her emotional state in that last mission.

            <p>The main reason behind that is Caroline&#39;s status as my self-insert.

            <p>1) To &quot;reform&quot;, a Sue has basically one big thing to do: develop a personality and stop warping everything around him/her. The PPC has also support groups and medications to help the process (Logicillin and Anti-Lustin come to mind)<br>Deglitterification process don&#39;t exist, as ex-Sues tend to stop producing glitter (and they weren&#39;t extremely glittery to begin with.)<br><br>2) That&#39;s fairly simple - remove from main Sue influence and administer Logicillin and/or Anti-Lustin accordingly.<br>If it wasn&#39;t the fault of a Sue suefluencing an Agent... Well, that isn&#39;t supposed to happen.<br><br>3) Interesting question. In this case, you can do basically what you want - Medical may create a body for the character to inhabit, DoSAT may create some sort of cyborg body... or maybe the character is particularly unlucky and is trapped into a inflatable rubber body for the rest of his/her life.<br>As long as you write it well, you can choose whatever you want.</p>

            <p>Before it was established that there was an SEP field, it was established that the canon itself helped to cloak the agents. That&#39;s partly why a canonical disguise that would believably kill a &quot;good&quot; character such as an elf or a member of the Fellowship was so important: it helped the canon help the agents.<br><br>So, it&#39;s not just the SEP field. There are other powers at work. (Doesn&#39;t that sound nice and portentous?)<br><br>And the PPC IS trying to remain hidden. Knowledge of them is not in any way canonical, so even if a character can break through all the protections and notice the agents, that doesn&#39;t mean they should necessarily be allowed to keep that knowledge if they can be neuralyzed or whatever.<br><br>... Unless it&#39;s really funny, as in the case of Gaspode. No one&#39;s gonna listen to him anyway.<br><br>~Neshomeh, PPC Ancient Historian.</p>

            <p>IIRC, in an MLP:FiM mission, Pinkie Pie looks straight at the agents but doesn&#39;t do anything. It&#39;s probably dependant on the level of possession, but Deadpool almost certainly would.</p>

            <p>Hi guys. You can call me Manzo! I&#39;ve been a fan of PPC stories for a while now, and I&#39;d like to eventually write one of my own. A friend of mine and I tried to write one a few years ago, but we don&#39;t have much contact anymore so the project was permanently shelved. I was wondering, since most stories involve teams of two agents, would want to partner up with me? It&#39;s either that, or developing a split personality...</p>

It got to the point that the DM had to specify settlements made of stone, because he kept setting fire to everything with his spells.<br><br>I also played a short Cthulu campaign and DMed a short Trekverse campaign in the final weeks before I left.</p>

            <p>Ugh. I&#39;ve played one game of 3.5, but then the guy refused to DM any more. We&#39;ve since tried to play a game of Mutants and Masterminds, which he even agreed to, but he then refused to, since apparently it can&#39;t be done over Skype. Even though we keep telling him to JUST FREAKING DO IT ONCE!<br><br>And then I got my friend the Marvel Heroic Roleplaying game, which I played at a con several times (and loved), and asked him to DM it because I knew it could be set up quickly. And then he refused to do it because he didn&#39;t like a DIFFERENT Marvel game, and when I pointed that out, I thought we would be able to play. And then an hour later he said we couldn&#39;t play it, again because he thought it was a different RPG.<br><br>Anyways, this was all a reeaally roundabout way of saying &quot;Hey, should we figure out a way to play an RPG like one these?&quot;</p>

            <p>My Sunday afternoon gaming group tried bringing in one player via Skype.  We had a lot of trouble maintaining a connection, and never figured out a good way to show him the battlemat.  I&#39;m certain there are webcams out there that can zoom in, but we didn&#39;t have one.<br><br>It didn&#39;t help that he was trying to take advantage of no one being able to see his dice rolls.

            <p>I&#39;ve played 3.5 (heavily houseruled), 3.5 (minorly houseruled), vanilla Pathfinder, 4th edition, and of all of them I think I love 3.5 with minor houserules the best. It may be a bit of a broken system, but given I play most of my games online there is still massive opportunity for getting into character in the course of the story (that you don&#39;t have to shout down your fellow players for :P ), and one of my favourite things about it is getting into character.<br><br>(I&#39;m really not fond of 4e, though, so I can join with you on that front.)<br><br>But hey, the main thing about the game is having fun, and as long as that&#39;s happening it&#39;s all good. :D</p>

            <p>I&#39;unno about split personalities, plenty of professional authors write multiple characters just fine and no one implies they&#39;re crazy. Well. Not because of being able to write multiple characters.<br><br>Anywave. Official PPC missions are only allowable after getting Permission, which requires sticking around long enough that the Permission Givers know you (generally simplified to &#39;a month&#39;) and then making a post requesting it. See <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">the wiki page on it</a> for details.

            <p>Sure I play D&amp;D, but I don&#39;t think I could bring myself to ever read a D&amp;D fanfic.

If I do end up writing stories, do they all have to be about one fandom? Most of the stories I&#39;ve read involve agents returning to the same fandom, so I was just wondering.</p>

            <p>There are fanfics about the various settings, in particular the Forgotten Realms, but i&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever heard of any about the game itself. Still, welcome,fellow friend of the d20!<br><br>As for fandoms, as Lielac said, no, you don&#39;t have to stick to any one fandom; we just tend to stick to those we know and specialise in, but that can still be a wide spread. For example, I have about eight or nine different fandoms I know well enough to work in without needing to consult others for major details. Other people may well have a lot more.</p>

            <p>Hi, and welcome. First thing, you need to read the Constitution (link on top of the page). The Wiki, as well as The Original Series, are also recommended readings. You can reach the wiki via the link below the one to the Constitution; you can find TOS there easily enough. Below the link to the wiki there&#39;s a link to the IRC, and you&#39;re more than welcome to pop by and say hi.<br>Since you seem to be interested in writing PPC stories, please read the article about <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a>; it&#39;s important!<br>To answer your question, most people have a duo of agents, though some write more, and there are certainly instances of co-writes.<br>Last but not least, have a cup of tea. Just don&#39;t let the weird taste (tea, coffee and bacon) weird you out. Letting the leaves eat you isn&#39;t a good idea, either.</p>

            <p>Well, first off, you don&#39;t have to create an account. Most of us never have! Just type &quot;Manzo&quot; (or whatever name you&#39;re going to use) into the &quot;Author&quot; field. Sometimes this gets overlooked, which is no big deal, but it&#39;s actually much easier to just type it in every time - the login function is notoriously broken.<br><br>Secondly, the PPC, last I checked, isn&#39;t actually copyrighted? If anyone does own a copyright, it would be Jay and Acacia. What we have in place is a fairly informal system where anyone can write with permission - but the reason for that is simple, not a legalistic thing; we just want to make sure people are representing us in good faith and with reasonable English skill.<br><br>(Getting permission is remarkably easy! Just hang out and be friendly around here for a while - reading the Constitution is a good start, and there&#39;s a lot of the community who hangs out on the IRC channel - and then, after you feel like you&#39;ve gotten to know the community pretty well and vice versa, apply! This requires just a regular topic with a sample of your writing, a brief bio page for your agents, and a link to whatever badfic you want to spork.)<br><br>Anyway, welcome to the PPC, Manzo! Do we still poke newbies? If so, *poke!*</p>

            <p>...to ask about the <i>Warriors</i> continuum by Erin Hunter. Is it a banned continuum to PPC, since it follows the adventures of cats that - aside from living in Clans and having cat-to-human translated speech - are identical to Real World cats? Because there&#39;s a <i>Warriors</i> badfic I&#39;d like to have Gilbert and Fiona spork, only there&#39;s absolutely NOTHING on the wiki about the continuum, which concerns me. Help?</p>

            <p>Ostensibly (oh, how I love that word), any Sues would be cats. Or one of the other furry or feathered creatures shown to have the level of intelligence the Clan cats are given (for added speshul, just add cat-loving foxes!) My concern is that, as this would require any agents involved in a sporking from this &#39;verse to kill an animal, some people may find <i>Warriors</i>-verse sporkings to be...off-putting.<br><br>Which seems silly because of the MLP sporkings, but makes sense to me because of the fact that these animals are perfectly capable of popping up in World One and some canons are based on real cats.<br><br>Although, no, the Hunter gals (four of &#39;em!) have not forbidden fanfictions of the meta-series.

If you don&#39;t wanna kill them, and you can&#39;t integrate them into canon (which you might be able to manage, maybe, with a clever application of Mass Neuralyzer and appropriate commands during the suggestible period after neuralyzation [but I don&#39;t know the canon so I&#39;unno how you&#39;d manage it]), then why not dump a horde of otherwise recruitable kittehs on HQ?

            <p>Of course your agents can visit the Official Fanfiction Academy of Starfleet! In fact if they want to rest after tackling Jack Russel, they&#39;re more than welcome to stay longer.

            <p>...and thoroughly enjoyed it. I&#39;m looking forward to hearing more. I particularly liked the Borg student - that&#39;s exactly the kind of idea I&#39;d have.<br><br>Oh, and you simply have to have the Borg Queen teach one of the courses (I mean, Sauron teaches at OFUM). Security of some sort might be in order to prevent her assimilating any students - although if some fanboy stampeded her he&#39;d probably get what he had coming. Besides, her take on end of year exams would be hilarious.

            <p>I&#39;m glad you liked it!<br>That is a great idea! What class would the Borg Queen teach? And should Seven, Picard, or Janeway be an assistant teacher?<br>Well, unless the member of Species 8472 was in human form, everyone would stay away. Far away. I can see Worf and B&#39;Elanna having lusters, though. Jack Russel comes to mind. But B&#39;Elanna wins the award for having the hardest name to spell, so we know what happens to those fanboys. Or Tom &quot;accidentally&quot; fires a phaser rifle at them. Or B&#39;Elanna fires the phaser rifle. <br>And Worf has a bat&#39;leth. Enough said.<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, she&#39;d know about technology, and quite a bit about various different species. Having her teach correct spelling and grammar might be fun...<br><br>I can imagine her exams being very hard to pass (100% being the only pass mark, of course) - and some people might be torn between whether failing or not failing was the more scary prospect.<br><br>Of your three proposed assistant teachers, I can imagine they would all squabble with her for various reasons (which would be amusing). Janeway would probably be the most professional about it, and Seven would attract more fanboy stampedes. Desire to stampede vs fear of teacher would be an interesting play-off. So... I&#39;d probably vote Seven.</p>

            <p>Well, the ship Cyba and Eagrus are currently on has on board no fewer than seventeen mini-Tribbles, not to mention one mini-Rancor, two mini-Tanks and two mini-&#39;Stus.

This would be partly due to Eagrus&#39; terrible idea of flying (his home continuum is the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>). Cyba, Sigma and Phi&#39;s appearances would also cause quite a stir (long story; explained in missions currently in beta-phase several posts above).<br><br>I also can imagine it being an interesting point to make to your students, to introduce the (crazy) people who have to deal with their &#39;Stus and other badfic.<br><br>It would need to wait until my missions are up so you can read them, though, although if you have read the offending badfic, you will have some idea of what they just came from, if not their own backstories.</p>

            <p>…those mini-tribbles could certainly start an invasion. If I remember correctly, he couldn&#39;t spell Torres. I understand not being able to spell B&#39;Elanna, but really, Torres is not that exotic of a name. <br>I looked up your agents--it looks like with Eagrus and OFAS it&#39;ll be a bit of a culture shock both ways, him being from fantasy. And his last name is Khan, which should totally scare Kirk. <br>I would be open to a co-write once I&#39;ve read some of your agents&#39; missions. How does a co-write work, exactly? I&#39;ve never done one before.<br>And the entrance should be made doubly interesting by the fact that Q will provide Cyba and Eagrus with the coordinates, so no guarantees on where they&#39;ll end up. Maybe in the middle of the Great Hall. During dinner, when all the fanbrats are there.<br>And, I was thinking about creating a student named &quot;Mack Rustel&quot; whose Lust Objects are Seska, B&#39;Elanna, and Seven. Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good idea to have your agents meet him. It&#39;s kind of like author-bashing, which is frowned upon.</p>

            <p>The missions are not fully up, yet. They are still being beta-ed (which I expect to take a little while, given there are five of them). I currently have them hidden on LJ, and will make them visable once beta-ed. I just put the links up on the wiki to be ready, for efficiency. Once beta-ing is done, I will make a mission announcement post on this board.<br><br>I have also been updating my agents&#39; pages on the wiki, to account for events since their first mission.

You might want to let the students settle in a little (at least having their first few classes and dealings with the mini-Gorn) before dropping my agents on them, though.

            <p>That makes sense. I still can&#39;t wait to read it!<br>I think I will let the students settle in.

            <p>I have to say, you really got better with your writing. Still, it&#39;s a long read, and I wish all of it was as funny as the Arster.<br><br>Things I noticed:<ul>
<br><li>Everything is a mini. If you have that many minis, you can handle them differently, especially the capitalization-based ones. I would have turned &#39;weeping angels&#39; into exactly that. A bunch of angels that weep. Probably at the badness of the fic. The doctor could have been a random doctor (not necessarily of medicine, be creative here). And do you know how many things go by the word jack?</li>
<li>You need to learn how to dose fic quotes. They shouldn&#39;t be too long and, ideally, showcase a thing you found. Like the Wapanese heart disease. You could have quoted the first time it was mentioned.</li>
<li>You like capitalizing things, do you? Things you shouldn&#39;t capitalize:<ul>
<li>Agent, unless it&#39;s used as &quot;Agent [name].&quot;</li>
<li>Colors, even if they&#39;re Suvian in nature.</li>

            <p>I always capitalize &quot;Agent&quot;, and I&#39;m pretty sure a lot of other people does that too.

            <p>... the Hivemind (we have one of those, right?) decided that it shouldn&#39;t be capitalised as a noun, only as a title.

            <p>... Never liked hiveminds, so I&#39;ll do the exactly opposite.

            <p>My counter-argument would be that in the context of a PPC mission, 99% of the time you say &quot;agent&quot; you&#39;re probably talking about a PPC agent, and so it would make more sense to distinguish the times you <i>aren&#39;t</i>. Most likely you&#39;d do that through an additional descriptor, though: &quot;the FBI agent&quot; or &quot;the viral agent&quot; or whatever.<br><br>That said, there IS an argument for Important Words. For instance, you won&#39;t catch me trying to tell anyone they shouldn&#39;t capitalize &quot;Flower&quot; when talking about the SO and his ilk, because they&#39;re <i>giant, sentient, telepathic Flowers</i> rather than the kind of flower you could grow in your garden. So, if you think PPC agents are that important, that&#39;s a thing.<br><br>I&#39;ll still correct for it on the wiki, though. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll agree on that. Flower, capitalized, is a proper noun. You can go and say giant, sentient, telepathic flower, which is in itself more of a description, but it&#39;s more convenient to just call it by its name, Flower.<br><br>An agent, however, is an agent. *shrug* Hope I&#39;m making sense here.</p>

            <p>Brilliant first mission; well done!<br><br>I must say, that is an awful lot of minis - and here was I thinking that the fourteen (in only three-hundred and fifty-seven words) mini-Colossi that I found on my first mission was a lot.

            <p>Thanks for the Bleepolate. Agent!Des would probably offer some Bleeptea in return, but he&#39;ll need all the Bleeproducts he can get his hands on for the co-write. I cannot stress how awful that &#39;fic (<i>TSAB DONWFALL: Halo War</i> which Firemagic reported a few days ago) is. It actually made me cry because the Canons are so OOC.<br>As to your question... I don&#39;t know, really. I assume that since &#39;assimilation&#39; in the Borg sense of the word isn&#39;t capitalised, capitalising it counts as miscapitalisation (like, say, capitalising &#39;kleptomaniac&#39;), and misspelling it is, well, a misspelling. The closest thing I can think of is &#39;midnight&#39;, but I&#39;m not sure how close that is to what you&#39;re talking about.<br>PS: You&#39;re more than welcome to adopt one or more minis (not including those already claimed); I need something to do with them, and keeping them all in RC log <i>e</i> would make a mess of the place.</p>

            <p>Do words from ordinary English, but which have a canon-specific use, also create minis when misspelled? Most notably, &#39;assimilate&#39; and the conjugations thereof with regard to <i>Star Trek</i> - if so, there will be four mini-Tribbles in addition to those already found so far during the mission I am currently writing.</p>

            <p>That is plausible. However, due to the amount of minis in that fic I have to gloss over quite a lot of them.<br>You are free to adopt one or more of them, or to adopt other minis which aren&#39;t claimed already.</p>

            <p>&quot;You realise I&#39;m probably going to end up having this baby here, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yeah, sure,&quot; Dafydd snorted, leaning back against the pillows. &quot;We must be, gosh, a whole half-hour&#39;s cart ride away from Malijach and the finest university hospital in the world. We won&#39;t be able to cover <i>that</i> distance while you&#39;re in labour, oh no.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, they&#39;ve been getting shorter,&quot; Constance pointed out, sipping her glass of water and turning a page in her book. &quot;Remember how long Tanfin took? And Bella was only nine hours or so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s physically possible to take less time than that,&quot; Dafydd countered. &quot;There have to be <i>some</i> limits.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what would you know about it, Mr. Illian?&quot; Constance asked, arching an eyebrow. &quot;I don&#39;t recall <i>you</i> being the trained medical professional around here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So do <i>you</i> think you&#39;re going to give birth here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not a chance. The idea&#39;s completely ridiculous.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>&quot;AAAAAARGH! Oh <i>gods</i> Dafydd I can feel the head!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um, um, okay,&quot; Dafydd managed. &quot;Tanfin should be almost back with Doctor Vishort now, it&#39;s only five minutes to his house, you can hold-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know where our ---ing neighbours live, Dafydd! He&#39;s not going to get here in-- oh <i>gods</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Help me, Este!&quot; Dafydd muttered, wishing (insofar as he was thinking coherently at all) he had any confidence the prayer would cross the multiverse and actually be heard by the Valie of Healing. He knelt down in front of his wife. &quot;What do I do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Catch!</i>&quot; Constance screamed, and then there was a gush of fluids that left the bathroom floor sticky and red, and Dafydd holding something pink and wriggly. There was a moment of silence.<br><br>&quot;Er,&quot; managed Dafydd. &quot;Okay. It&#39;s a girl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Daphne,&quot; said Constance, looking down at him - and then burst out laughing.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Dafydd demanded. &quot;<i>What</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Four hours!&quot; Constance exclaimed breathlessly. &quot;Not nine - <i>four hours</i>!&quot;<br><br>And <i>that</i> was when there came a knock at the door...<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And that was pretty much how it went, barring a few minor differences*. So yeah... Huinesoron is now an honorary midwife, and we have a new baby girl in our family.<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/PPCFamily.jpg"><br><br>She is... well, small, pink and squishy, but she does have lovely curly hair (once we washed it) and a very loving big brother - and parents, of course!<br><br>hS &amp; Kaitlyn<br><br>*hS was not nearly as composed as Dafydd, our conversations were rather less expository/foreshadowing, and we had a very nice ambulance operator on the phone.</p>

            <p>So, just out of curiosity, what monster scares you the most?<br><br>I&#39;m voting Weeping Angels, myself.  There&#39;s just sommat about not being able to see them move (recent episodes don&#39;t sodding count) that pushes my NOPE button like nothing else.</p>

            <p>I feel like Weeping Angels used to be the most terrifying things around, back in their <i>Blink</i> days.  The more they&#39;ve shown up, the less scary they seem, in my opinion.  Still, they are freaking <i>creepy</i> in a way a lot of monsters aren&#39;t.<br><br>However, like a few people below, I think my vote has to go to either Slender Man or something out of the SCP foundation.<br><br>Or, actually, has anyone here read <i>John Dies At The End</i>?

            <p>Weeping Angels, definitely. Because it&#39;s really easy for them to sneak up on you -- actually, <i>all they can do</i> is sneak up on you -- and I <i>hate</i> that. Especially in the dark; then I couldn&#39;t even see them to pause the sneaking-up. And the invading my brain possibility, and reproducing via <i>my imagination</i> and killing me on the way out... yeah, no. Go away, Moffat, nobody likes youuu... -curls up in a corner-<br><br>So, of course, my brain goes to &quot;Hey, y&#39;know what would be hilarious...?&quot; and imagines Maggie being dramatically terrified of the things too.

            <p>The Weeping Angels are indeed scary, but the worst they can do is send you back in time. The Vashta Nerada on the other hand, are almost impossible to detect and will tear all the flesh from your bones. That and they are impossible to kill, according to Time Lord who regularly slaughters Daleks. Outside of Doctor Who, I would say The Thing from the movie of the same name is the creature I would least like to meet in a dark alleyway.</p>

            <p>For some reason, I never thought the Vashta Nerada were scary. Well, that&#39;s not quite right, Silence in the Library terrified me.

            <p>Although I can scare myself pretty good, too.<br><br>Like these two characters:<br><br>&quot;Rogue&quot;, who is like the weeping angels in that whenever he attacks or kills something, any cameras or lights, or even one&#39;s ability to see, are disabled for the duration of his onslaught. And, what&#39;s worse, he horrifically mutilates his victims, but until the lights and cameras and whatnot come back on, it&#39;s impossible to know this because his attacks are completely silent. According to the canon I wrote around him, only about four people can withstand his powers - a human scientist with unnatural resilience, a human agent who is really good at dodging, an alien doctor from the same race as Rogue, and ab alien agent, also from the same race as Rogue.<br><br>The other character I wrote was based loosely on the story of Faust - and he bears the same name. Basically, Faust is a monster that exists within the self-loathing of others, and uses their hatred and fear as his weapons by which to torment and murder his victims, and that&#39;s not even taking into consideration the body-defiling curse he places on his victims that constantly grows worse the more knowledge of their inner selves they obtain, until they become little more than zombies within their own minds. The only survivor from faust&#39;s wrath is a boy named Christopher, who escaped from a fire only to watch as his family burned to death from within.<br><br>So, yeah. I write some pretty messed up stuff sometimes.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been doing NaNoWriMo since 2006, and I&#39;ve never actually managed to finish yet.

I&#39;m almost done with a shortish story that came along, about a courier and an emperor, and I think the emperor&#39;s backstory might make a good NaNo - I don&#39;t know what happened at all, so there&#39;s no plot yet besides a Vizier who&#39;s not evil, several Council members who are... ambitious, and at least one civil war.<br><br>I&#39;ll probably make it to halfway through the year and then explode.

            <p>Whoooo, here we go again. I only discovered the madness that is NaNoWriMo last year and I am sad to say my story fell through. It was plot that was destined for short-storyhood, something I only discovered after the first ten thousand words. Thankfully, I have a plot that looks like it will survive my bouts of writers block, procrastination, and midnight inspiration. Praise the month of coffee and hand cramps from typing too much!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m definitely doing it this year, mostly because I&#39;ve got a great story idea that I can&#39;t wait to write, but also because my one friend who got me into it will kill me if I don&#39;t. Last year was my first year and I fell short by about 5k, but by the end of the month I had lost all semblance of plot and I had no idea where I was going. Hopefully this year will be better; I actually have all the plot details planned out this time!</p>

            <p>Well, in a sense. <br><br>The sudden change from clothes to armor is similar, but minus the vocalization.

I&#39;m actually working on a mission outline that explores that. A sort of... &#39;Mary Sue&#39; rehabilitation. A disease can be possibly cured. But genetics... that&#39;s a bit harder. That would need continual therapy to prevent the effects from failing and the former Sue coming to light.<br><br>These are just my thoughts, though. I&#39;m working something in along these lines for the NaNoWriMo coming up- I&#39;m going to try and put out as many Missions as possible. If anyone else has any headcanons, maybe post to here?</p>

The Pill is a good idea (and, it&#39;s one of the more common treatments for PCOS, at least initially,) because really, everything else is cosmetic and could be explained away by the setting. (No body hair? Characters from a lot of fandoms are drawn that way. Purple eyes? Again, plenty of drawn and quite a few written fandoms have them just for the sake of pretty.</p>

            <p>Some kind of hormone supplement to encourage body hair growth, and contacts or something to cover up the eyes if it&#39;s deemed necessary. While she still doesn&#39;t get a period, this has rendered her sterile.

            <p>I apparently had forgotten a few things about the mutation. The agent/ex-Sue would probably also require something to balance out their metabolism. Which, if they&#39;re not careful, could result in a rapid weight gain, as someone who has lived their entire life never having to worry about what they eat or how much they exorcise is brought closer to a normal human metabolism.<br><br>And, while the information does say that the women with the mutation are still fertile, I imagine that, along with a few other things such as the &quot;doesn&#39;t burn&quot; bit will probably go away once the influence of Sue-logic is removed.</p>

            <p>Welp, I have some fics to report.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3828663/1/Unison_Mage"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3828663/1/Unison_Mage">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3828663/1/Unison_Mage</a></a><br>Set a year after StrikerS. A legacy of ancient Belka left behind, how will section six deal with the new relic and its powers even as mysterious people attempt to attain its powers? Fate centric. Please Read and Review.<br><br>Well, it&#39;s annoying, but not really terrible. This&#39;d probably make a good training mission for someone. Fate somehow releases a Gary Stu who is a Belkan knight, but doesn&#39;t use a device, and has ice magic. Oh, and his name&#39;s Poke. To get a sense of what&#39;s up with this, have a quote or two:<br>&quot;Fate, are you sure a six year old kid is suppose to be in this battle?&quot; Questioned Vita.<br>&quot;Are you taking about yourself Vita.&quot; Joked Nanoha as she walked into the clearing with a grinning Vivio in her arms.<br><br>Yes, just let the kid with unknown magic and origins who&#39;s attacked a teammate in the past train with you! There&#39;s no possible way for this to end badly. Also, Nanoha, you are perfectly aware that Vita is far older than you are, and she looks like she&#39;s eight, not six, anyways.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177653/1/The-Avatar-and-the-Mockingjay"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177653/1/The-Avatar-and-the-Mockingjay">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177653/1/The-Avatar-and-the-Mockingjay</a></a><br>&quot;You have no idea what I&#39;ve been through!&quot; Korra yelled. Katniss couldn&#39;t help but give her a smug grin and laugh. &quot;Oh, I know exactly what you&#39;ve been through,&quot;<br><br>Short, but ever so stupid. We just start off with Katniss and Korra yelling at each other. We never get any explanation other than apparently Amon is running Hunger Games now. Seriously, that&#39;s it. Then, apparently Korra is a brat for being angry that Katniss is acting like she&#39;s a six-year-old. Then Katniss chi-blocks her. No, I&#39;m not kidding.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I know exactly what you&#39;ve been through,&quot; She smirked, &quot;living on a safe compound your whole life, free to practice your &#39;bending&#39;, then you get to live in the city for free with a loving family and mentor, be a pro bending hero - and I should feel sorry for you? Everyone on your team deserves the posistion you&#39;re in more than you do - even that priss Asami.&quot; Korra stared at her wordlessly, feeling the anger bubble within her. She cursed the fact there wasn&#39;t a full moon so she could just bloodbend this girl to the next district. Katniss walked to her, until they were toe to toe.<br>&quot;How dare you call yourself the savior of your people,&quot; She growled. That was Korra&#39;s breaking point. She let out a breath of fire that Katniss narrowly avoided. The girls went at it, Katniss continuing to narrowly avoid Korra&#39;s bending moves until Katniss got a hold of her hands. She used a chi blocking move she had been taught earlier, rendering Korra defenseless. Korra lied on her stomach, Katniss straddling her back. She leaned down close to her ear, just so she could hear her.<br>&quot;How do you expect to save your people, your benders, when you can&#39;t even defend yourself from me?&quot; Katniss stormed out of the room. Korra was able to pull herself up after a moment. While her muscles ached from the jabs Katniss had dealt to her, what hurt more was that she knew she was right - she had failed as the Avatar.<br><br>Gorram it, Katniss. <br><br>And that&#39;s not even the worst thing. Not by a long shot.

Gods below, I am not making ANY of this up. This disgusts me. And you know what? It&#39;s. Rated. T.

The Plumbers now focus on peace-keeping operations and training new recruits, but when TSAB ships begins attacking one of the largest Plumber bases on Earth, war became inevitable. Who shall succeed?<br>So! The TSAB decides that its whole, let civilizations develop, protect worlds from the threat of magitech weapons, and keep the peace is for losers. They just start an all-out invasion of Earth because it&#39;s Monday and they&#39;re bored. Seriously, this fic has no freaking idea how the TSAB works. At all. And, while we&#39;re on the subject of complete misrepresentation of a peaceful organization...<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966278/1/TSAB-DOWNFALL-Halo-War"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966278/1/TSAB-DOWNFALL-Halo-War">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966278/1/TSAB-DOWNFALL-Halo-War</a></a><br>The TSAB has changed for the worse, the Ace of Aces tries to defeat them but fails. Now she has been changed by this, physically and mentally, and knows that she will need help in the battle, luckily she finds a dimension that has what she needs.<br>This thing. Screw this thing. This thing, I think, might be the Rainbow Factory of Nanoha fanfiction. Let&#39;s look at some character in Nanoha, shall we?<br>First off: Fate Testarossa Harlaown. She is one the kindest women in the series. She is gentle, and patient, and modest. She specifically works with cases involving children, because as a child she was abused and was part of a magical experiment, and so she is often the only one able to talk down kids who would, say, electrify anyone who came near them. In StrikerS, she adopts a little girl named Vivio, and--here, I&#39;m gonna give you a clip (warning: Fate, the blond woman, is in her underwear)<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHywA1KsYlU"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHywA1KsYlU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHywA1KsYlU</a></a><br>In this fic, she tortures a woman, tortures her friend, in front of that little girl. Violently and for a long period of time. Anyone see the problem there?<br><br>Let&#39;s look at a different character: Takamachi Nanoha herself. She&#39;s one of the most moral characters I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of watching. She is kind, but she will still beat the friendship into you if you are hurting people. There&#39;s a moment in the first season of Nanoha that I think pretty much encapsulates her character: She&#39;s fighting Vita, who, the last time they met, beat her into the ground. Before they even start fighting, she asks Vita what her name is, introduces herself, and asks why Vita is doing what she&#39;s doing. She says that, if Vita has a good reason, she&#39;s help her with what she&#39;s doing. <br><br>In this fic, she kills people. She kills soldiers, she kills commanders, she even helps launch a bombing on a city. And you know what? She doesn&#39;t kill Fate. She walks in on Fate torturing Schach, in front of her daughter, and just KO&#39;s her. Here&#39;s a quote:<br>What worried them was that she appeared to be ready to kill her former comrades, who currently formed the Elite core of the TSAB&#39;s forces.<br>She responded by saying:<br>&quot;If we do fight, I will hurt them but not kill them, I will just make it so they can&#39;t fight anymore, as for the enforcers, if they try to kill me ….<br>… I WILL kill them.&quot;<br>That&#39;s right. She&#39;ll let torturers go free, because they&#39;re her friends, but will only kill soldiers because she doesn&#39;t know their names. And the story just acts like this is a perfectly moral thing to do.<br><br>And you know what? This story has no idea--it&#39;s even worse than that Ben 10 one in terms of knowledge. The TSAB is apparently overthrown in a coup, but the new leaders don&#39;t lose control of any of the planets, and no one--not Lindy, not Hayate, not Chrono, ever decide to leave the TSAB to help Nanoha. The TSAB releases Jail Scaglietti--one of those &#39;Elite Core&#39; people is a girl named Ginga Nakajima. Scaglietti BRAINWASHED her in StrikerS and made her almost kill her sister. Guess she forgot about that.<br></p>

            <p>Thanks. As it stands, my mission is nearly done - I just have the Replacements to execute - so I&#39;ll probably have time for this. Also, a three-person co-write sounds fun.

            <p>Pretty much describes Nanoha&#39;s modus operandi. If the people she fought would just sit down and talk things over, then she&#39;d be happy, but she usually needs to blast at them with high-power energy weaponry to get to the &#39;sit down&#39; part. Then they become friends and solve whatever problem was making them fight in the first place. <br><br>Yeah. The TSAB was very careful to not let anyone know about their existence on Earth because they follow the Prime Directive. Planets only join up when they want to.</p>

            <p>And that&#39;s not even the worst part. The TSAB in this is pretty much the Always Chaotic Evil Empire--they go around conquering planets that they&#39;ve never been bothered with before, and everything they do is evil. There are almost no evil characters in Nanoha. Everyone has a reason for what they&#39;re doing. Outside of insane beings that weren&#39;t really sentient (like the Mariage) I can only think of two evil characters: Jail Scaglietti (who had a bizarre moral system and wasn&#39;t all there to begin with ) and That Bitch Quattro, whose name shall always be prefaced with That Bitch. Let&#39;s look at another quote, shall we?<br>She then saw that her idea&#39;s of peace and that death was wrong became void as she found that they had been doing very dark deeds such as the book of darkness, when they found it and in the case before it became hers, they had caused the book to go out of control by forcing dark memories into the master, causing the book to activate on the ship transporting it, the ships Lindy&#39;s husband and Chrono&#39;s father was captain of.<br><br>WHY. THERE IS NO BENEFIT FOR THE TSAB TO DO THAT. The TSAB, from what we knew of that time, was trying to peacefully get the Book. This fic is taking one of the more tragic moments in the series--a father dying to protect people, his best friend being forced to kill him--and using it as an excuse to drum up cheap anger against a strawman TSAB.<br><br>And it is a strawman. Everything the TSAB touches is automatically bad and everything related to Halo is automatically good. Raising Heart, a TSAB device, is one of Nanoha&#39;s most loyal companions, but is broken in the first chapter. So it&#39;s remade--well, that&#39;s a loose term--by Halo characters. It&#39;s got a new form, a new operating system, and a new intelligence. There is nothing remaining of Raising Heart in this new device, but Nanoha--or Nova, because it&#39;s not Nanoha, not anymore--doesn&#39;t give a crap about her loyal partner essentially having its corpse torn apart and used to make a new and completely different partner. It&#39;s not like there were segments where a Device character and a human one would talk about the philosophical implications of being artificial, no siree!coughcoughepisodefivecoughcough<br><br>And to add to the strawmanship, there&#39;s never any contest. Every battle ends with hundreds of thousands of TSAB soldiers dead and a hundred ships destroyed, and with one AFS (Nova&#39;s bit-character army) soldier getting a papercut. There is no tension and no attempt to make any.<br><br>And--and Agito. Agito once made a promise to Signum that if Signum ever became evil, if she ever turned from the path of justice, Agito would incinerate her. Signum asked Agito to do that, in episode 25. Welp, Signum&#39;s turned bad, and guess what Agito did? She ran away and became the device for a girl who can&#39;t even Unison. This fic makes her break a promise she swore to fulfill in memory of the man who saved her. <br><br>One final thing: Nanoha is killed in the first chapter, then revived with Super Speshul Forerunner junk. The TSAB kills her. And---more quotes.<br><br>Then the war happened, and worse, Nanohas death.<br>It tore Hayate apart, almost as much as what she found that caused Fate and half of the former riot force to join the new bureau.<br>Yes! Seeing the girl you love die at the hands of the organization you fight for would be the exact thing to make you even MORE loyal to that organization!!!!!! WHAT ABOUT THIS DOESN&quot;T MAKE SENSE!?!?!?!?!?!??!?</p>

            <p>Oh geez, my halo knowledge is so limited...<br><br>The best I can give you is that Sangheili are known better as Elites - big guys, long necks, inverted knees, mandible mouths, religion-obsessed, carry laser swords, can turn invisible, can do dash attacks, and are about a match for Spartan units - and that they were once the military bosses until the Prophets booted them in favor of Brutes. Following the canon from here, I think the Elites got rather upset, and at the encouragement of an outcast known as the Arbiter, they ended up siding with humans against the rest of the Covenant. Other than that, no clue about this Rtas&#39;Vadum guy.<br><br>As for Spartans, since there were once so many, it&#39;s possible that there were Freds or Kellys or Lindas, but I&#39;m not sure about the other two.</p>

            <p>Robert Downey Junior&#39;s portrayal of Sherlock Holmes has birthed the interest of several interested suethors.

            <p>Believe me, I&#39;ve spent years thinking about this. <br><br>When I was in eighth grade I wrote a Mary Sue. This is especially interesting considering I was in the PPC at the time and I had recently gotten Permission. My Mary Sue, however, wasn&#39;t a self-insert; it was a glorified version of a friend of mine (I eventually revised the hell out of her and turned her into Lori Starrett).<br><br>A Mary Sue appears when a writer is blind to their(or the person they&#39;re trying to write in&#39;s) flaws. At the time I did not see that [Lori] was a naive and rather mildly racist person who, despite our converging of interests in social politics, is still going to vote for Mitt Romney (I&#39;m trying my best to be neutral here but I really don&#39;t like that guy), so I put her on a pedestal and subsequently her character became a Mary Sue. <br><br>Suethors who write self-inserts, on the other hand, often try to dissociate themselves from their creations (because if they acknowledged it was a self-insert, they&#39;d have to look for their own flaws in that character and Mary Sue is Too Preshus To Have Flaws). However, they can&#39;t help but insert the positive aspects of their personality, and try to come up with milder flaws in an attempt to balance things out - but of course, that never works out because the canons love her flaws, too. <br><br>Character writing for the average teenager is ridiculous amounts of hard. I wasn&#39;t even technically teenaged when I got Permission, so I&#39;m one of those freaky kids who started writing at the tender age of ten and therefore nipped most of it in the bud, but I can tell you a person at that age is 1) still struggling to understand themselves, 2) not experienced with creative writing, and 3) not experienced enough to make believable things happen to their characters. It&#39;s much easier to make a Sue when you&#39;re younger, trust me.<br><br>It&#39;s even easier to make a Sue on your first go at character creation, no matter what your age is. Generally the first character of many writers is the result of years of inexperience in character creation, so the majority of First-Fanfic OCs tend to be Suvian. <br><br>Conclusion: Suethors are always going to exist because we can&#39;t expect children, preeteens, and most teens to understand life enough to create living characters. Personally I just wish they&#39;d keep the fics to themselves. Sue/Canon is one of the most selfish things a writer can do, because it&#39;s telling the world to PAY ATTENSHUN TOO MAI OC U GAIZ, SHES PERFECKT AND IF U DONT LIEK U WILL BE ASSIMILAYTED!11!1ONE! at the cost of everything else. <br><br>-tries to take off fangirl psychologist glasses-</p>

            <p>Maybe in order to write decently, we all have to write a few Sues first. If there&#39;s a person here who has never written a Sue, it&#39;s probably because they started out writing on essays or poetry.<br><br>Both in-world and in terms of the Real World, this is why the PPC doesn&#39;t go after Authors. An Author has the power to truly strengthen a continuum--but most of them will start out writing Sues or bad crossovers or generally messing up their grammar and spelling. In order to get the benefit of the Author&#39;s later work, you&#39;ve got to tolerate their early &#39;Sues. Or, in the case of the PPC, assassinate the Sue and send the Author to an OFU.<br><br>In the real world, we don&#39;t attack authors for the exact same reason: Because the same person will probably write good stuff and bad stuff. Because we&#39;re people who have written both good stuff and bad stuff.<br><br>I think it&#39;s very important to make that point in missions--that a Mission-worthy story is not an indication that a person will forever be a horrible writer. It&#39;s just an indication that they wrote at least one bad story. That&#39;s something every writer does. Yes, even the famous ones.</p>

            <p>You could do things like MSTing, or commentary like they used to do in Deleterius and still do in other sporking comms on LJ. Those don&#39;t require Permission. Writing it as a PPC mission requires Permission because it uses PPC ideas.

            <p>Permission is needed to use the concept of the PPC itself, because the PPC is a semi-quarantined continuum. But if you wanted to spork it in some way other than using the PPC to kill a Sue or rearrange a bad crossover, etc., you could totally do that. You could even use it as a Permission piece. I&#39;m not sure if this has been done before, but you could certainly write your agents as freelancers, dealing with the fic before they even know what the PPC is--followed by recruitment, naturally, if you decide to ask for Permission. The concept of either &#39;Sue-killing or fixing the damage a fic does to a continuum is not proprietary to the PPC, and you wouldn&#39;t be doing any plagiarism if you did those things. Just don&#39;t use anything that the PPC invented, and you&#39;re fine.</p>

            <p>I really loved your piece. Like TO said, it takes the &quot;modern girl in a magical land&quot; trope, which is usually badly done and does it well, presenting real problems, like a magic based society being freaked out by flashlights. I love how at the end Val has no idea what just happened; that&#39;s pretty much how I would react if I were given a magical sword and made king of a land I wasn&#39;t even born in.</p>

            <p>The in medias res wasn&#39;t too terribly confusing, I hope! <sup>_^</sup> It&#39;s just how the story came to me: Ellie thumping a book down on the table and (as it turned out, faking) being irritated and confused about the Sword in the Cup thing, and I continued on from that point. Should I put your name on the list of people who want to read the rest whenever I get around to writing it? :D<br><br>And I&#39;m very glad you liked the end; I had way too much fun realizing that Ellie was more than just a nice, mildish-mannered mage, and just exactly <i>what</i> the MacGuffin was for. Izzit a magic sword? Oh, hell yeah. Is it kind of both Caliburn and Excalibur? Myup! Is Val going to get forced into being King? Ellie sure seems to be planning that, the jerk!</p>

            <p>Seeing all the rave reviews, I had to take a look, and I concur most heartily! My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that it feels like we&#39;ve picked up in the middle, and I&#39;d love to read the beginning. &#39;Course I want to read the rest, too, but I&#39;m very curious to see how Val found herself in another world and became friends with Eleanor and started on this quest in the first place.<br><br>I approve of that second name, by the way, even if it is a little surreal seeing it refer to someone else. I have a rather personal attachment to it. <sup>_~<br><br>There</sup> were one or two lines that gave me pause, though:<br><br>- &quot;She squinted at the pages before her, then scowled at the dim red balls of light floating at various points between the shelves and the black clouds visible through the high windows.&quot;<br><br>I think you mean she scowled at the balls of light between the shelves and then scowled at the clouds outside, but it took some work to get there for me. The construction &quot;between the shelves and the black clouds&quot; could put the floating balls somewhere between the library and the sky—not terribly useful for the people trying to read. {= )<br><br>- &quot;&#39;And what would be the reason for their discomfort?&#39; Eleanor asked absently, continuing to scan the pages and on the right-hand one.&quot;<br><br>Not sure where you were going with the description from &quot;continuing.&quot; Maybe &quot;continuing to scan the right-hand page&quot;?<br><br>- The dialogue between &quot;There is a seat on this side as well, Valerie&quot; and &quot;That does not look natural.&quot;<br><br>There seem to be two conversations happening in parallel here, one about behavior and the other about the lake. This happens a lot in writing, but isn&#39;t how people usually talk—there isn&#39;t enough time. Given a choice of topics, a person will respond to the thing they feel is most pressing, and the other person responds to that, etc. Here, you could easily have them banter about each other&#39;s behavior for a few lines and then bring it back to the lake when Val leans over the book to see the illustrations.<br><br>That&#39;s all I caught. I loved the descriptions of the weather once they got to the lake. I could really imagine how heavy and cold the rain is, and hear it crashing down, muffling the girls&#39; words and making them shout.<br><br>Also... heh. &quot;Royally screwed.&quot; I do believe that is a pune, or play-on-words. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><i>My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that it feels like we&#39;ve picked up in the middle, and I&#39;d love to read the beginning.</i><br><br>That would be because I did! I&#39;m writing the beginning right now. Well, for a definition of &#39;right now&#39; that includes mental scribbling. I take it I should start a list of people who want to read it, then...<br><br><i>- &quot;She squinted at the pages before her, then scowled at the dim red balls of light floating at various points between the shelves and the black clouds visible through the high windows.&quot;<br><br>I think you mean she scowled at the balls of light between the shelves and then scowled at the clouds outside, but it took some work to get there for me. The construction &quot;between the shelves and the black clouds&quot; could put the floating balls somewhere between the library and the sky—not terribly useful for the people trying to read. {= )</i><br><br>Hmm. Yes, I do believe you are correct. Would &quot;[...]between the shelves<u>,</u> and <u>at</u> the black clouds[...]&quot; have worked better?<br><br><i>- &quot;&#39;And what would be the reason for their discomfort?&#39; Eleanor asked absently, continuing to scan the pages and on the right-hand one.&quot;<br><br>Not sure where you were going with the description from &quot;continuing.&quot; Maybe &quot;continuing to scan the right-hand page&quot;?</i><br><br>Oof, yes, looking at that again it looks a bit mangled. I was trying to explain that she&#39;d been on the left-hand page before, and was now on the right-hand one, but was still at the same pair of pages.<br><br><i>- The dialogue between &quot;There is a seat on this side as well, Valerie&quot; and &quot;That does not look natural.&quot;<br><br>There seem to be two conversations happening in parallel here, one about behavior and the other about the lake. This happens a lot in writing, but isn&#39;t how people usually talk—there isn&#39;t enough time. Given a choice of topics, a person will respond to the thing they feel is most pressing, and the other person responds to that, etc. Here, you could easily have them banter about each other&#39;s behavior for a few lines and then bring it back to the lake when Val leans over the book to see the illustrations.</i><br><br>Hmmm. I do rather like it, but it would be easy enough to shift the lake comments down a bit... I&#39;m trying to search my brain for examples of myself doing that but as far as I remember I haven&#39;t in actual speech, so I shall concede the point.<br><br><i>I loved the descriptions of the weather once they got to the lake. I could really imagine how heavy and cold the rain is, and hear it crashing down, muffling the girls&#39; words and making them shout.</i><br><br>YES! Hahaha! I was so hoping I managed to get across the sheer thundering, pounding, deafening force of the storm and oh, look, I apparently did! WHOOOOO! Awesome!<br><br><i>Also... heh. &quot;Royally screwed.&quot; I do believe that is a pune, or play-on-words. *g*</i><br><br>A pun, milady? You accuse me of making a <i>pun?</i> -dramatic gasp, clutching of pearls- How dare you! :D Why yes, it was a pun. It was a terrible pun and I love it, and I&#39;m glad you like it too.<br><br>- Lielac</p>

Yup!<br><br>Spoilers for what&#39;s being scribbled in my head:<br><br>Val trusts Ellie due to Ellie being the only person she knows in Avala, and Ellie abused the hell out of that trust to get a figurehead. Damn magic sword&#39;s not going to leave Val alone, either, so she&#39;s going to have some fun times up ahead once she realizes that it doesn&#39;t matter how betrayed she feels (or how much she just wants to take copious notes on Avala&#39;s magic) because magic contracts don&#39;t need you to read the fine print. Or any of the print. Especially when Merlin&#39;s involved.</p>

            <p>Brainweasel is a term a friend of mine came up with to discuss the irritating parts of a brain - the ones you know aren&#39;t true, but they plague you all the same?

Doesn&#39;t matter if everyone dies in flames, now, does it, because it&#39;s just a dream anyway... Ooh, and if Tanya stayed up until she <i>crashed</i>-crashed she could have got in all of Fate/stay night, the UBW movie, and partway through Fate/zero. This assumes she pulls a crazy and stays up at least 24 hours straight, but considering she was tired enough to <i>fall asleep on her keyboard</i> I do believe she did.</p>

            <p>Your agents seem to have quite a bit of promise; I love the contrast between Tanya&#39;s attempting to be utterly cool in the face of everything and Magdalen&#39;s habit of &quot;talking with her whole body&quot;. I did wonder why you gave them <i>both</i> the habit of assigning nicknames to people, but it&#39;s not actually an issue as such.<br><br>Your writing style is clear, flows well and is quite engaging. I loved your characterisation and the whole context of the piece - it&#39;s not often I see a modern-day-girl-in-sword-and-sorcery-world situation done <i>well</i>. I giggled quite a few times during it; the conversations between Eleanor and Valerie were wonderful, especially the discussion on appropriate lighting and the culture clash inherent in it. The final twist was also hilarious, and I cracked up completely. XD<br><br>In other words, I gladly grant you Permission.

            <p>I need somebody willing to take on a somewhat lengthy DMS mission in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. The length is due to there being two fics involved, a prequel and a sequel starring the same OC. Canon knowledge is always a plus, but attention to characterization, pacing, and continuity is a must. I&#39;m really hoping to get some feedback regarding whether everything goes together smoothly and makes sense from beginning to end, since this mission was written in many spurts over more than a year, maybe even closer to two. I&#39;ve changed direction and rewritten various segments so many times there are sure to be some details I&#39;ve forgotten to fix here and there.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
