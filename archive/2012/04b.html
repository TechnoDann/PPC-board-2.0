I am an average writer, and the a member of the self appointed grammar police amoungst my friends. <br><br>Also, a quick question. Do you guys hate all stories on fanfiction.net, or just some. I know of a few good ones, but there is some really scary stuff there.

            <p>Generally speaking, fanfic is rarely hurting the author; the copyright-weakening issue is at least given lip-service with those &quot;I DO NOT OWN X&quot; disclaimers, and it&#39;s not like people are reading fanfic in <i>place</i> of buying the book/movie/game/what-have-you. (At least, discounting straight-up plagiarism like &quot;The Girl Who Lived&quot; or Cassandra Claire&#39;s stealing whole paragraphs worth of text from <i>The Secret Country</i>)<br><br>If I lived in some magical alternate universe where I actually finished the things I started and somebody wrote badfic about one of my stories, my reaction would probably be to write a scathing anonymous review, or else to just ignore it.<br><br>But then, I suppose I&#39;m biased, what with the fact that I&#39;ve pretty much lived on the Internet since I was around 12.</p>

            <p>(BE WARNED - POSSIBLE NON-SENSICAL RANT AHEAD)<br><br><br>In my opinion, I think it comes down to a number of factors. Mind, these are from what I have gleaned from the authors&#39; comments and may not be the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation: <br><br>- Commercial impact - Writers need to maintain a living, so will said fanfiction be illegally profiteering beyond the bounds of non-profit writing? (e.g.: rewriting &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; with a few minor changes and selling it as your own work)<br><br>- Perception of original content - Will repeated, altering depictions of content unintentionally result in the fandom gaining a differing, incorrect assumption of said content? <br><br>i.e.: Think if the horrors of &quot;My Immortal&quot; reached a mass audience level and impact - could it alter fan perception of the H.P. series as a whole?<br><br>- Public domain - Is the content in question clearly defined as being under copyright and is said copyright being maintained by the author/benefactor/author&#39;s estate? If not, how true to the original content would said derivative work maintain itself?<br><br>- Author authority - Has the author of the original content made it clear whether they&#39;d allow/deny the publication of derivative works based on their own?<br><br>- Reliance on other&#39;s work (minor concern) - Could reliance on writing fanfiction only unintentionally impact on an individual&#39;s ability to create original content?<br><br><br>Any opinions?</p>

            <p>oh I know that one already, lolz, thanks to the reading on YouTube (I didn&#39;t listen to all of it, but I had to satisfy my morbid curiosity ...). <br><br>I also live in Wales!

            <p>Okay, when I read fanfiction, I like to listen to music. ...actually, I like to listen to music anyway, but that&#39;s beside the point.<br><br>Recently, I&#39;ve been running out of good music to listen to. Youtube may be my friend when it comes to music, but it in no way helps me learn of cool bands to listen to.<br><br>So I was wondering... &#39;What music do the other boarders like to listen to?&#39;<br>I know many agents end up listening to music when they need to block out sound or distract themselves... but what music?<br><br>So, anyway... I&#39;m more or less looking for the best music ever~<br>I&#39;ll add my own, but yeah, we should share the amazing music, see what music everyone else listen to, you know?<br><br>And I&#39;ll start by saying the (IMO) obvious answers of Led Zeppelin and The Beatles!<br>The Beatles are just awesome, althoughg my current favourite Beatles song is Yesterday, and I grew up listening to Led Zeppeling all the time, especially Thank You and Stairway to Heaven...<br>Some other good bands I can think of are Sixx A.M. and Bloc Party, too... <sup><sup><br><br>So</sup></sup> enough of my favourite music~ Let&#39;s see what everyone else likes~<br><b>HIMU WANTS <i>YOU</i> TO FUEL HER MUSIC ADDICTION!</b><br><br>~Himu~</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not an agent yet, but here are a few recommendations.  Lindsey Stirling has some really good techno/violin music, and journey and Kansas are good 80&#39;s music. Owl city, The civil wars, Simon and Garfunkel, Train, the script, survivor, foriener, evanessence, within temptation, Regina Spektor, and Kate Nash. Most of these  are pretty common, but I like them. You should give them a try. <br></p>

            <p>Ever hear of Two Steps from Hell? They do this great orchestral-type music, mainly for movies. Speaking of which, composers like Zach Hemesy and John Williams have some pretty good stuff too..</p>

            <p>...some excellent French artists? I&#39;d suggest listening to the band &quot;Les Trois Accords&quot; (try their <i>Youri</i> and <i>Grand Champion International de Course</i>. Just know that their music videos have absolutely nothing to do with what they&#39;re singing about), Edith Piaf (her <i>Amants d&#39;un jour</i> is particularly beautiful), and anything by Alain Bashung.  </p>

            <p>OK, first thing about Angelspit: Don&#39;t watch the video for Toxic Girl unless you like horror movies with added sex. That aside, try anything you can. The best from each album are, IMO, Scars and Stripes, Lust Worthy, As It Is In Heaven, and Defibrillator. As for the others, try Nurse Grenade, Twenty6hundred, and Like It? Lick It!<br><br>deadmau5: 8bit, Edit Your Friends, One Trick Pony, Ghosts &#39;n&#39; Stuff, Sofi Needs a Ladder, Arguru, Slip, Professional Griefers, Raise Your Weapon.<br><br>Yeah Yeah Yeahs: Gold Lion, Heads Will Roll, Modern Romance/Poor Song, Dragon Queen, Man, Maps, Cold Light.<br><br>:) Have fun!

            <p>I tend to be all over the spectrum when listening to music. Recently I&#39;ve been really into Vocaloid songs, but those don&#39;t stick to a single style or genre. Other than that my favorite bands would probably be The Fray, OneRepublic, and Five for Fighting.</p>

            <p>I <i>love</i> power metal and symphonic metal (Nightwish, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Apocalyptica, Lordi, and the first half of the stuff Irish Samurai just mentioned), and have a strange addiction to metal remixes of Touhou music (e.g., <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B4JfbnqSGw"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B4JfbnqSGw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B4JfbnqSGw</a></a>).

            <p>Yeah, Propane Nightmare is a pretty cool track, although my favourite (and the one that got me into them as a band) is still Watercolour. <br><br>As for Nightcore, I find it to be the same as fanfic; there&#39;s a lot out there, made by a lot of different people with... differeing levels of ability. </p>

            <p>In a storywise way, I mean. Would it work as a PPC department? Narrative songs wouldn&#39;t be too bad - a folk tune set to (bad) heavy metal, for instance, could be visualised as a shiny lead version of the setting of the original - but what about non-narrative tunes? And even then - what would the target be? To hunt down the offending musician inside? That&#39;s flaming and personal attack. To re-sing the song into a good shape? That could be interesting - <i>I</i> wouldn&#39;t want to write it, but someone with a musical brain could probably pull it off. Maybe to locate pivotal points in the constantly-looping &#39;tale&#39; and plant sound-switchers there (and I can see agents getting lost in fractured remixes, unable to find a chorus...)<br><br>It <i>might</i> work. Hmm. Dunno.<br><br>hS, like that</p>

            <p>Almost certainly AU, too... Music Department, Reclamation Division.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>“So, ever worked in Music before?”<br><br>Althea Gold shook her head. “Assassin all the way,” she said. “I’ve covered songfics, though.”<br><br>Tracer smiled slightly. “That won’t do you any good around here,” she said. Something about her tone irritated Althea – she didn’t know why, but it did.<br><br>“I <i>have</i> been doing this a while, you know,” she said irritably. “I mean, not to boast, but I lived through the Reorganisation – I think I can handle the idiosyncrasies of your department.”<br><br>“They all do,” Tracer said with a shrug. “So let’s test you and see, eh?” She tapped a few keys on the console, and the familiar portal appeared. Althea stepped through, her new partner close behind her.<br><br>The other side was a bleak, white landscape which seemed to shift around her. “Where are we?” Althea shouted over the wind. “Forodwaith? Hoth?”<br><br>“I knew you wouldn’t get it,” Tracer replied, insufferably smug. Althea bent her head under the weight of the wind and tried to think. It was as if the whole world was under a subtle pressure, weighing her down.<br><br>“Mama! <i>Mama</i>!”<br><br>“… is that a <i>child</i>?” Althea exclaimed. “Out in this? What kind of author-“<br><br>“Not an author,” Tracer corrected, “and it’s not old enough to be a child. Come <i>on</i>, Agent Gold, this is the <i>Music Department</i>. Use your thinking muscles.”<br><br>Althea scowled. There was nothing <i>here</i>! Just snow, more snow, a random infant, and that weight. She caught Tracer’s eye, saw the amused look, and then… it clicked. She looked around at the landscape in a different way.<br><br>“Ice. Ice. Baby. And we’re under pressure.” Althea lifted her head and glared at Tracer. “Is your whole department just one long bad pun?”<br><br>“Seems like it sometimes,” Tracer replied cheerfully. “But there’s work to be done here, too. We’re in the Reclamation Division, which means we have to find stolen bits of songs and send them home. So here in <i>Ice Ice Baby</i>…”<br><br>“We find the bassline from <i>Under Pressure</i> and send it back to Queen,” Althea deduced with a sigh. “And how do we do <i>that</i>?”<br><br>“You can feel the pressure,” Tracer told her. “Now try and find the centre of it…”<br><br><hr>

            <p>Actually, the music I listen to can be roughly divided into three categories: Celtic, Classic, and soundtracks.<br>So, um, a sample from each, I guess.<br>The Celtic sample is Darkness by Blackmore&#39;s Night.<br>The Classic sample is... {insert dramatic drums here} BWV 1052! (Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of Bach to choose from; this is my favourite concerto, together with BWV 1056)<br>The soundtrack sample is Yuuki no Imi (The Meaning of Courage, that is) from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS&#39;s soundtrack. Which is pure awesome.<br>You can find all of them in YouTube.</p>

It&#39;s kinda hard to find music on Youtube if you have only one word to search by... or maybe even just a song title would help too~<br><br>And Dubbed Vocaloid~ <sup>^</sup> *dances*</p>

They are amazing, and I will refuse to believe otherwise.<br><br>Nightcore is dancey music, quite often a remix of a song, which has a fast beat, is <i>always</i> high-pitched and just sounds happy in general. It&#39;s sort of derived from trance, but calling it trance will probably get you shot.<br><br>Goregrind is... well, if I just say that the first song that comes to mind is called &#39;Anal Destruction by a band called &#39;Abцrted Hitler Cцck&#39;, uh, can you guess what kind of music they do?<br>Surprisingly, it isn&#39;t offensive.<br>And if you can&#39;t, try <i>listening</i> to that song. (It&#39;s surprisingly good for a song where you can&#39;t tell what they&#39;re saying.)<br><br>Yuppers~ Vocaloid rules~ Although I do often wonder why Megurine Luka has so many songs that aren&#39;t Japanese...</p>

            <p><br>Please welcome the agents of Response Center 221a: Department of Floaters~!<br><br>Agent #1- Robert Vernet, formerly known as Sherlock Holmes<br><br>Appearance: Wild, shaggy brown hair, dark eyes, and a faint stubble across his chin. Facial expression can best be described as &#39;pensive&#39;, unless you&#39;re in the Harry Potter continuum, where &#39;thoughtful&#39; will have to do. Tends to have a meerschaum pipe clenched between his teeth, full of Longbottom Leaf. Tall and bony. Wears the black uniform of an average PPC agent, with a Floater flash patch on his right shoulder... a dark brown deerstalker hat, and a long blue scarf. If asked about these accoutrements, he simply laughs.<br><br>Personality: Brilliant, arrogant, and just a leetle too self-confident. Vain, when it comes to his mental capacities, and responds a little TOO well to flattery. He&#39;s originally from the Victorian era, and was originally one of the &#39;leading men&#39; in a piece of slash. He has a number of hang-ups related to this. Has a highly addictive personality, though his addictions tend to be to ward off boredom. Before coming to the PPC, he smoked like a chimney, drank too much, did cocaine and morphine, played World of Warcraft, and watched entirely too much bad daytime TV. Now, he doesn&#39;t get bored as often- his console won&#39;t LET him- so he mostly restrains himself to the wide, WIDE array of bleeproducts available to agents. Doesn&#39;t make friends easily. A bit of a loner. Tries to be coolly logical, like his (original) namesake. Some days he is better at this than others. Has inherited his namesake&#39;s deductive skills, and tastes in most areas. Speaks a little more formally than your average teenage PPC agent, but a little less formally than some of the agents who are ACTUALLY from the Victorian Era, due to his original authoress being lazy. Oh, and his RC looks like it&#39;s a mess, but he&#39;s got an &#39;idiosyncratic&#39; (read- completely batsh*t) system of keeping everything where it goes.<br><br>History: Robert comes from an Implausible Crossover RP- South Park/Sherlock Holmes. In this fic, instead of barely surviving his plunge from the Reichenbacher Falls, Holmes fell through a portal into South Park. General hilarity and some slash-y romance ensued. When the PPC came to clean things up, they found themselves with a problem, in the form of one Sherlock Holmes. In canon, Holmes is repeatedly stated to be rather sexless, and almost emotionless. However, while this Holmes was more than capable of emotion, and had fallen in love with (an adult version of) a South Parkian, he wasn&#39;t a Gary Stu. He was like Paddlebrains- a legitimate, functional Character Replacement. Long story short, he decided to work with the PPC rather than die. His name&#39;s Robert in homage to Robert Downey Jr., and Vernet because he always liked the name. (It was a relative of his.) He&#39;s at the PPC for almost a year now, and has already driven two partners off (they couldn&#39;t handle his &#39;quirks&#39;.)<br><br>Weapons: A sword-cane, which he can use as either a sword or a singlestick, and a revolver. He&#39;s an accomplished boxer, and has trained- but is not very good- at the Japanese art of Baritsu.<br><br>Lust Objects: John Watson and Irene Adler, from Sherlock Holmes; Christophe &#39;ze Mole&#39; DeLorne from South Park; L from Death Note; Charlie Epps from Numb3rs; River Tam from Firefly.<br><br>Fandoms: Anything remotely Sherlock Holmes related, Death Note, Numb3rs, Lie to Me, South Park, Firefly, Ender&#39;s Game, and Lord of the Rings. He enjoys any canon that&#39;s big and complicated and has well-defined rules. He really loathes bad Holmes adaptations, and HATES Psych because the main character tries to pass his powers of observation off as magic.<br><br>~<del><br><br>Character #2: Mundar o&#39; the Five Hills (A.K.A. Mr. Fivehills)<br><br>Appearance: Mundar&#39;s a dwarf. As such, he&#39;s short, squat, and thick-boned. &#39;Compact&#39; might be the proper word to use here. His beard&#39;s long, thick, ruddy, dirty, and beer-soaked. He TRIES to braid it Gimli-style, but ends up leaving it half-done and/or coming apart. He&#39;s also got a full head of thick, wild, dirty ginger hair. His skin&#39;s tanned, almost weatherbeaten, and also dirty- he seems to have a permanent layer of grime on him. He&#39;s got twinkling, dark eyes, and laugh lines etched into his face. He&#39;s bare-chested and barefoot, though he wears a black kilt with the Floater flash patch on it. Until recently, he refused to wear any other clothing. Unfortunately for the rest of the PPC, he&#39;s discovered Jayne&#39;s Hat, and wears a replica of it, as often as Vernet will permit.<br><br>Personality: Mundar is merry, cunning, shrewd, and a wee bit of an anarchist. He&#39;s obsessed with his own personal freedom, and will do anything to flaunt the fact that he&#39;s &#39;free-er&#39; than you. In fact, he is the freest dwarf ever. Any who dare to challenge this claim are met with a first-hand view of what lies under his kilt, until they require large amounts of bleeprin. If Mundar&#39;s life is threatened, he&#39;ll announce that he&#39;ll die a free dwarf and rip off his kilt. He&#39;s hearty, laughing, and fond of drink and song. Usually all of those together at once. He&#39;s extremely gay- his straight, male creator made him so for the LOLs- but is firmly in the closet, and won&#39;t admit to any of his LOs. He has a bad habit of using any piece of paper in reach as a towel/toilet paper. Vernet has taken to leaving a copy of &#39;New Moon&#39; out for him to use for the purpose. <br>Mundar is having some trouble adjusting to PPC life, for three reasons: First, he is having some trouble adjusting to the idea of following the rules/charging Sues instead of killing them on sight/not being able to drink 24/7. After a few run-ins with the Flowers that Be, he&#39;s grudgingly following the rules he needs to follow, and ignoring the rest. Secondly, he can&#39;t read. Vernet is teaching him, and he&#39;s learning Canon from books on tape, but until then, it puts him at a disadvantage when it comes to the Words. Thirdly, he clashes with his partner a lot. Vernet likes stability and order, and is less than patient with people who break the rules; Mundar is nothing if not chaotic and unruly. Their arguments are legendary.<br><br>History: Mundar is a minor character from an original Dungeons and Dragons campaign setting named &#39;Erythos&#39;. He was supposed to be a friendly NPC, assisting the heroes. Once his role in the campaign was finished, his author had no idea of what to do with him. He let an authoress adopt him. Said authoress promptly stuck him in the PPC, where he&#39;s been languishing ever since.<br><br>Weapons: He&#39;d prefer his axe; if that isn&#39;t available, he can use pretty much any heavy weapon. He&#39;s not averse to using his fists either.<br><br>Fandoms: Lord of the Rings, Firefly, Pokemon, Order of the Stick, and Artemis Fowl. He has a guilty weakness for Twilight, though he&#39;d never admit this to any of the other agents.<br><br>LOs: Gimli, son of Gloin, from LOTR; Mulch Diggums, from Artemis Fowl, Jayne Cobb from Firefly; Jacob Black, from Twilight. Of course, he won&#39;t admit to any of these, either. <br><br></del>~<br><br>*Ze Piece*:<br><br>To anyone but Robert Vernet, RC 221a looked like a pigsty. Books, loose papers, and video game controllers were scattered across the surface of Vernet’s long, narrow desk, three empty tea mugs sat on top of the TV, clothing hung from every available surface, and a bag of Longbottom Leaf rested inside his Killer Rabbit slippers. If there was any organizational scheme at all, only a genius or a madman could have understood it.<br><br>Unfortunately for his former partners, Vernet was a little of both.<br><br>The dark-haired Floater flicked through a stack of Intelligence reports, tracing the lines of text with a long, bony finger. He chuckled, and placed them on top of a teetering paper stack. To him, this wild mess looked like the very face of order. It was his own little world, and he was at the center.<br><br>That was, until a muddy dwarf fell from a hole in the ceiling, crash-landing on the tallest pile.<br><br>Vernet stared at him for a long moment. The dwarf was filthy, covered from head to toe with greenish mud. He had wild, ginger hair, an unruly, ginger beard, weatherbeaten skin, and he positively reeked of beer. His only article of clothing was a threadbare kilt.<br><br>“...Who in God’s name are you?” Vernet frowned.<br><br>The dwarf staggered to his feet, sending a few more papers falling off the desk. He planted one muddy foot firmly on top of Vernet’s copy of The Silmarillion.<br><br>“I am MUNDAR O&#39; THA FIVE HILLS, Bane of Norskai, Nemesis of Du&#39;Kal, Defiler of Ancient Scrolls, Public Enemy Number Two, and FREEST Dwarf in tha Land!” he roared.<br><br>Vernet winced, and tried to tug the book away without Mundar noticing. His stance was extremely stable, though, and eventually, the Agent gave up. He had more important things to worry about. Such as how a dwarf had gotten into his RC to begin with.<br><br>“Vernet. Robert Vernet.” He extended his hand for Mundar to shake, but the dwarf frowned and put a hand to the hilt of his axe.<br><br>He gave it up as a bad job, again, and lowered his hand. Vernet sized him up in the blink of an eye, as he usually did. He could tell a lot about someone just from giving them a once-over, because he noticed small details that few other people caught. Right now, though, he was looking for one thing.<br><br>“You aren’t a Stu,” he said, relieved. With a list of titles like that, he had been worried… but there was a distinct lack of urple or glitter in the dwarf’s general vicinity, and Stuthors tended to hate dwarves anyway. They weren’t pretty enough.<br><br>“...Stu?” Mundar looked around, bewildered. His gaze landed on the stacks of paper, and he grinned.<br><br>“Oh, just what I needed!”<br><br>Before Vernet could stop him, Mundar snatched up the front page of the Intel report he’d been reading and smeared it across his bare chest, wiping away the mud. He gave a little grunt of satisfaction, and reached for another sheet.<br><br>“Get away from that!” Vernet snatched the paper from his hands. “That&#39;s going into my casebook, you little-“<br><br>He cut himself off. There was no point to being impolite, even to a barbarian like this.<br><br>“Hey! I found it fair an&#39; square!” Mundar leaped at him, axe in one hand, grabbing for the sheet. “An&#39; I&#39;m not finished with it!”<br><br>Vernet stepped back, holding his hands up in a conciliatory way. He didn&#39;t want to anger an inebriated, axe-wielding dwarf.<br><br>“Go ahead, take it. ...Where did you come from?” he asked, quietly.<br><br>The dwarf’s eyes widened, and he frowned.<br><br>“I&#39;m from the Trollwood, a&#39; course!” he said.“ Ain&#39;t ye heard o&#39; me?”<br><br>/Great God above…/ Vernet pinched the bridge of his nose. He didn’t like people, and this- this dwarf was particularly infuriating. He went through the words of his mantra in his head, calming himself, and took a deep breath.<br><br>“...I&#39;m not from your world,” he told Mundar. “This is another realm. We call it PPC HQ.”<br><br>Mundar snorted.<br><br>“Heh. Pee pee...”<br><br>Vernet scowled.<br><br>“It’s short for Protectors of the Plot Continuum, and you’d do well to remember that,” he said. “... What world are you from?”<br><br>The dwarf lowered his axe and thought for a long moment, stroking his beard. It reminded Vernet of a rat’s nest.<br><br>“...Ery-whatsits,” he finally said.<br><br>/The little blighter doesn’t know the name of his own world?/<br><br>“One moment, please, Mr. Fivehills...” Vernet said, dryly. He opened the bottom drawer of his desk, pushed aside a Parcheesi board and a cheese grater, and pulled out his C.A.D. It looked like a cross between a ray gun and a tuning fork, and he was very proud of the fact that it hadn’t exploded once.<br>The Ironic Overpower took note of this fact.</p>

            <p>I want to give my two coppers on the subject of Robert Vernet, while we are here.  To be blunt, he is a blatant Stu.<br><br>I understand that you were going for a Paddlebrains type character here, but there are a few problems with that in this case:<br><br>1) Paddlebrains was fairly different from the character she replaced.  She was her own character with some similarities to Sirius Black.  Vernet, on the other hand, <i>is</i> Sherlock Holmes with a few superficial changes (his name, his modern habits, etc).  One of the few major changes you did make was to take away his addictions, which makes him more of a Stu, not less.<br><br>2) Serius Black was not a Stu.  Sherlock Holmes is a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Historical_Sue">Historical Stu.</a>  He has qualities that make him way too powerful for any canon but his own, which you would like to take him out of.<br><br>To further my point, some of the descriptions of Vernet and his abilities in the writing sample point straight to Stu.<br><br>&quot;<i>If there was any organizational scheme at all, only a genius or a madman could have understood it.<br><br>Unfortunately for his former partners, Vernet was a little of both.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>It was his own little world, and he was at the center.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Vernet sized him up in the blink of an eye, as he usually did.

To help make him a viable character, because I think he does have potential, I would like to offer a suggestion.<br><br>Try making him Robert Vernet, instead of Not!Sherlock Holmes.  Maybe he thinks he is Sherlock Holmes but, in reality, he is a guy with no more perceptiveness than most people, who believes he can see all sorts of details that other people miss.  Maybe he is striving to <i>become</i> Holmes.  These allow for a level of character growth that him already being Sherlock Holmes really doesn&#39;t.<br><br>If you want to discuss this further, I am willing to help you come up with some ideas to make this character work.  My email address is on the wiki (Username: Phobos7) or you can sometimes find me in the chat.<br><br>Note for everybody:<br><br>I&#39;m not going to lie, I am against the idea of Not!Canons as a general rule.  We should be able to create our own characters by the time we are writing for the PPC, we shouldn&#39;t have to take a canon character and write them into a world of our own.  That is called Transdimensional Snatching.  We have a Department, in the organization, dedicated to stopping that sort of thing.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t do it.  I am saying that, before you do it, you had better have an excellent reason.  &quot;I want to&quot; and &quot;Because it would be cool&quot; are not excellent reasons.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t really take that into consideration for a few reasons.<br><br>For one, Holmes as a character is only plausible where there is sense and logic. He works completely off of his reasoning skills. That is, there are things that add up that can be reasoned from in a logical manner, and that&#39;s where he gains those things you&#39;re concerned about as a character in any incarnation. Logic and things building up to a reasonable conclusion isn&#39;t something one can do in a badfic. <br><br>Badfic, more often than not, has these giant leaps where there is no sense or reasoning behind what is done in them, which would basically break that. <br><br>Second, his partner also has to be taken into account. When agents are too similar, or one is more dominant than the other, there is less room for potential humor, because the clashes and differences are generally what bring dynamism into the spin-off. AnnaBee&#39;s sample shows us that both aren&#39;t the sort to give in or let the other steamroll them, and Mundar&#39;s personality is chaotic enough- and frustrating enough for Vernet- that it throws Vernet off fairly quickly as indicated in that sample. Future parts will likely show continued blocking, ignoring, doing things without regards for Vernet, and so on. <br><br>With those things in mind, I didn&#39;t really see it as much of an issue, given where the character is being used and with who as an intended partner. </p>

            <p>It is still a concern, for me.  I just wanted to make it known that I had this concern, since it is a big one.  This way, AnnaBee knows what to look out for when she is writing, so she doesn&#39;t take him in a direction that would make him a full-blown Stu.

            <p>That&#39;s EXACTLY what I was thinking. The thing about the PPC is that it&#39;s completely illogical... and Holmes (thus, Vernet) is a creature of logic. He&#39;s already becoming a far different (and, you know, insane) character, JUST due to having to cope with a world that Does Not Follow The Rules. Though I don&#39;t see him going flamethrower-crazy any time soon, he&#39;s definitely slipping. And, as I said, in this life, his powers are only useful as party tricks in the PPC proper.<br><br>Oh, yes. Just wait until Mundar starts streaking. Or singing &#39;The Hero Of Canton&#39; really loudly in a Firefly badfic. Or, Eru forbid, discovers movie musicals. Or tries to steal one of Gimli&#39;s braids as a souvenir. Or... or... *so much Or*<br><br>@ Phobos, with the drugs- In canon, NOT in the more realistic Holmes spinoffs, the drugs don&#39;t really have much of an effect on his ability to function. He mostly takes them to keep his big old brain occupied when nothing interesting is going on. In the PPC, you&#39;re ALWAYS on a mission, or recovering from your last mission. So, long story short, while he still has a near-idolatrous love of tobacco (Longbottom Leaf hasn&#39;t helped matters in this department), still drinks like a fish, and still occasionally shoots substances that are meant for eye surgery into his veins, he&#39;s much LESS likely to do so than he was, either in his fic of origin or in canon. <br><br>Until he gets bored, that is...</p>

            <p>One does not simply stop taking cocaine or opiates when one ceases to be bored.  They are powerful drugs with powerful addictive properties.  So, either he still does them, or he has gone through some serious withdrawal at some point in the past.  Bleeproducts are very likely not a suitable substitute.  Something to consider.<br><br>Anyway, congrats on your Permission.  Your characters have potential and I look forward to seeing them make use of it.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t sure of WHAT to say on that, mostly because I didn&#39;t know whether or not the PPC had any rules about that sort of thing.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking either he&#39;s still WELL on the habit, which could be a problem (e.g. he runs out of cocaine midway through a bleepfic and needs to go get more, but he can&#39;t leave the mission, thus, he starts getting the shakes and getting IRRITABLE AS ALL H*LL, and they need to get all the charges in BEFORE he loses it...<br><br>Or... he&#39;s a Sam-Vimes style, &#39;one-is-too-many-two-is-not-enough&#39; sort of recovered addict, who&#39;s trying desperately to stay clean... and keeps getting assigned to Druggie!Sues. :P </p>

            <p>This answer courtesy of all the fine folks in the IRC who wouldn&#39;t let me read my book until I&#39;d stepped in. {; P<br><br>Anyway, there&#39;s really just the one rule: the Rule of Funny. Generally speaking, addiction and withdrawal are not funny, particularly when you start talking about hard drugs like cocaine, which is why you&#39;ve never heard of any other agents who are users. It&#39;s a tricky subject with a huge potential to cause discomfort in other people if handled inappropriately. &quot;Trivialization&quot; can be a charge in badfic.<br><br>On the other hand, there&#39;s nothing saying you can&#39;t do it if you think you can successfully play it for laughs. A lot of comedy works by <i>not</i> holding anything sacred. If you&#39;re comfortable taking the risk that you could crash and burn and offend people—or even succeed and still offend people—then I won&#39;t tell you not to try it.<br><br>Personally, I think your second option is the most likely to succeed. Pratchett is excellent at taking a heavy subject and balancing it with levity, so his is a good example to follow.<br><br>Another question, of course, is &quot;why is this important to do?&quot; I haven&#39;t read the rest of this thread myself, but from what I&#39;ve heard, this issue exists because the character in question is supposed to be Sherlock Holmes in all but name. Is that really necessary, or is there another way to do what you want in your spin-off without hijacking a canon character with all his baggage and sticking it in a setting where it might not be appropriate? It might be worth considering.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who always asks why.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s nice to be able to bump things that might benefit from more exposure, but it&#39;s not so nice when it comes to spotting new things and watching old ones. I like to keep track of what&#39;s going on, and it&#39;s harder when the new things get buried under gigantic old things. It&#39;s easy enough to scroll down to find a thread you&#39;re already involved in if you know where it is in relation to other stuff; it&#39;s harder when the order changes all the time. For me, the benefits aren&#39;t outweighing the drawbacks.<br><br>Also, seconding Data and others: for as long as we&#39;re keeping bump mode, if a conversation you&#39;re in with just one or two others starts getting long and you want to keep talking, please take the conversation elsewhere out of courtesy for those not involved.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I like the old way better. This way, the board seems to fill up with long conversations between only a few people that constantly top the board, and it&#39;s more confusing trying to find new things that you might want to post on. <br>I vote to change it back.</p>

            <p>I like the ability to have things bumped up. It seems like it is going to add a bit of requiring people to be considerate of others and not dredge up dramatic threads days after they were last posted on, or to continue those threads that result in huge stretches of white space.Long threads can go on and get long without making the Board stretch like that. If people would make a point to post in response to a higher order of the topic instead of endlessly replying to the response directly above, then the thread could get long and not drag the Board out of shape. Or it could go to another more chat-friendly place if it&#39;s really just folks chatting.<br><br>Anyway, my rambling response is that I like the idea of it bumping up. I know when I post missions, one of my worst dreads is having someone post three or four posts right on top of it, especially stuff that will get long like newbie intros. Then the missions get out of the main view within an hour or two of being posted, and they never, ever end up with many reviews in that case (And hey, I can&#39;t say that I don&#39;t love getting reviews ;)). I&#39;ve already noticed a couple of times that the bumping has brought missions back up to the top. (I include myself in that doesn&#39;t always notice covered up missions category.)</p>

            <p>It will take a bit of getting used to, but aside from that, I think this is a huge improvement.<br>Of course it is a bit annoying with the huuuuuuge threads taking up all the space, but sooner or later they will get buried and fall down to page two.

            <p>The huge page-stretching conversations are annoying, when they get bumped up and then you have to scroll for days to find something of interest.<br><br>As a side note to anyone and everyone who has perpetuated said conversations: We have an IRC channel for a reason. Also, email and IM clients exist. There&#39;s also a second board that is hardly used, which doesn&#39;t bump, as far as I know. Use one of these other options, please. It&#39;s cool that you&#39;ve made friends, but when your conversation hits the point where it takes up so much space that people have to scroll down the equivalent of two or three screens, and it&#39;s just two people talking, you should maybe switch to another medium to continue, for everyone else&#39;s sake.</p>

            <p>When new missions and other written things get posted, I don&#39;t always have time to read them immediately.  When that happens, I&#39;d like to find them sitting where I left them last, rather than having to scour the entire front page to discover where they got pushed to.  Especially since missions frequently don&#39;t see new comments right away and have a tendency to drop down more quickly than an active, informal discussion.</p>

            <p>I like to think I&#39;m not too bad about that. I can&#39;t help but <i>notice</i> tropes as I write, but I try not to write <i>to</i> the trope. Despite the whole Tropes Are Not Cliches deal, most characters written around one primary trope are flat and boring; I try to make sure that even if I get the original concept of a character from tropes (&quot;Hey, you know what would be fun? A Cute Psycho Staff Chick!&quot;), I&#39;m working from at least three or four and fleshing out all the reasons they happen to be that way.<br><br>Basically, I try to treat tropes as archetypes, with characters falling into a category but not being defined by it. If that makes any sense. &gt;_&gt; Plus I&#39;ve always found that the most entertaining trope examples are the ones that do something unusual with the idea, so I try to aim for that as often as possible.</p>

            <p>Using Tropes to build a character is STILL using Tropes, no matter how many you throw into the mix to broaden them. <br><br>Explaining who a character is, using only tropes, doesn&#39;t tell us who they really are, or anything substantial about them. Okay, she is a Cute Psycho Staff Chick. Now you have a cardboard cutout of an attractive girl with a staff, and possibly a rather nasty gleam in her eye, or a bloodied  staff. But who IS she? WHY is she that way? Does her using a staff have any relation to her character at all?<br><br>Tropes are a crutch, used to explain a character in wide, general terms. They are NOT helpful when trying to make someone from scratch, as you place the person in a box with a label. When you start them off with a big label, you can duck and weave as much as you want, but it still defines them. <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>My point is that I try to make sure there ARE reasons. I get inspired by reading random things, and in the case of Iris, it happened to be a trope description for the Staff Chick; I started pondering why so many characters of that overall type happened to have such similar personalities. I then started thinking about the sort of person I&#39;ve <i>never</i> seen a Staff Chick be, and one of the things that crossed my mind is that even in settings where <i>everyone</i> is messed up in some huge way, the Staff Chick&#39;s neurosis is usually shyness and anxiety. So I thought, &quot;What could you do to give her a <i>different</i> mental health problem?&quot; That&#39;s the point where the weird little corner of my brain that adds trope hyperlinks to everything brought up that whole archetype of the girl who looks cute, but if you catch her at the right/wrong time turns out to be frighteningly unstable. Then some other corner of my brain went, &quot;Hey, that actually sounds sorta cool!&quot;<br><br>My point is that while she was <i>inspired</i> by the two tropes, by now Iris has a lot more to her than that. I could describe her as a Yangire White Magician Girl, or I could describe her as a young woman with a natural talent for healing magic and a family history of schizophrenia who saw both of her parents killed by undead with her biomancy-vision on, and the massive emotional and psychic trauma from that incident triggered her into full-blown disorganized schizophrenia. She&#39;s in a setting with little understanding of psychology as a discipline and <i>certainly</i> no antipsychotics, so even though years have passed since The Event, she still regularly slips into word-salad babbling and often says things that other people find disturbing without realizing there&#39;s anything odd about it. She clings to her magic almost as a security blanket, playing with raw biomantic force constantly because she likes to watch the little blue lines move (and their absence reminds her of the forces of <i>anti</i>-life animating the monsters that killed her family). She loves dogs, has been known to try to make &quot;improvements&quot; to local wildlife (She once found a sparrow with a broken wing. It now has an unbroken wing, three eyes, and rainbow pinfeathers.), and has either panic attacks or violent-screaming-terrified-rage attacks when faced with undead. And she&#39;s a Cute Psycho White Magician Girl.<br><br>The closest equivalent to how I think about tropes is... well, has anyone seen the Dresden Files RPG, and how it describes characters via &quot;Aspects&quot;? For example, Harry has the Aspect &quot;Wizard Private Eye&quot;, but no one&#39;s saying that&#39;s <i>all</i> he is. And hell, half the Aspects in the Who&#39;s Who listing pretty much <i>are</i> tropes; Morgan&#39;s &quot;Zealotry in the Pursuit of Justice is No Crime&quot; means the same thing as the trope &quot;Inspector Javert,&quot; and Thomas&#39;s &quot;I Must Fight My Demon&quot; could be easily replaced with &quot;Enemy Within,&quot; for example.<br><br>Speaking of Jim Butcher, he&#39;s said that he once got in an argument with a friend about whether you needed a good idea to have a good story, or whether you could write a good story based on a bad idea. His friend dared him to write a good story based on a stupid idea of his (the friend&#39;s) choice. Butcher took him up on it. The idea: the lost Roman legion, <i>with Pokemon</i>. The result: the Codex Alera, one of the most crazy-awesome high fantasy series ever.<br><br>tl;dr: I don&#39;t think the source of an idea automatically detracts from it, whether TVTropes or anything else. Or, to quote the SCP Foundation:<br>*<i>The Vampire Diaries Insight</i>: &quot;There&#39;s no such thing as a bad idea. Only poorly executed awesome ones.&quot;<br>**<i>Clef&#39;s Addendum</i>: &quot;However, some ideas need to be executed perfectly to cross the line into awesome.&quot;</p>

            <p>In all fairness, it hits up a lot of tropes too (farm boy hero etc-end-series-spoiler). And, well, in my own opinion, if you don&#39;t guess just from the premise what&#39;s going to happen--or at least by the end of book one--you&#39;re asleep. <br><br>That said: it&#39;s still presented wonderfully, and that was the whole point of his writing it. It&#39;s so fun, and for once the hero wins by being intelligent, and it&#39;s shown, not told. I think if I had to live in any fictional world, that may be the top one--top five at least.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s far more than just the tactics, there are WW1 references all through the Guard; <br><br>The tank designs themselves are more reminiscent of WW1 era vehicles than modern machines, with the tracks that circumnavigate the entire chassis, and particularly the side mounted weapon sponsons available for the Leman Russ (and various other Forge World tank models). <br><br>They&#39;re one of the few armies those infantry regularly have fixed bayonets (the others I can think of being possibly Orks, and Chaos, although they usually have a &#39;spiky and bladed&#39; theme in total, so I&#39;m not sure it really counts). <br><br>They have elite infantry units called Stormtroopers.<br><br>Several of the worlds mentioned in the Codex and novels have conscription. <br><br>There might be some more, but I can&#39;t think of it right now. <br><br>Due to the parallels between IG and WW1 armies I have actually considered trying to build a trench system for my gaming table, although haven&#39;t taken it anywhere yet as I haven&#39;t worked out how to do it fully.<br></p>

            <p>Welcome.  Have this bag of polyhedral random number generators as a sign of friendship.<br><br>Now on to your question.  I would caution against reading the Legendary Badfic.  It is all really terrible and there are other things to read that would be far more enjoyable.  We are a community based on good writing, which may not have been clear from TvTropes.  We don&#39;t like bad writing.  We like turning bad writing into good writing.<br><br>Anyway, do as you will with the Legendaries.

The FAQs that are linked on the main page are especially useful.<br><br><a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/"><b>The Original Series</b></a> - This is one of the things I mentioned that would be far more enjoyable than the Legendaries.

            <p>Celebrian, Cupcakes, and quite a few others on the LB list are bad, but they&#39;re the sort that you won&#39;t quite grasp just how bad they are unless you have familiarity and love of the canon. For example, i&#39;m only sort of familiar with LotR, so Celebrian is mostly just boring.<br><br>Eye of Argon is amusing because of the writing, but if odd choices of phrase, and purple writing don&#39;t amuse you, it won&#39;t be your cup of tea.<br><br>Honestly, for more general audience WTFery, I&#39;d say look up Topless Robot&#39;s Fan Fiction Friday feature. The stuff found there tends to hurt on a different level, be it terrible biology, terrible spelling and grammar, or some combination of the three. And, if the story itself isn&#39;t enough for you, the commentary tends to make up the difference.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s up with the recent influx of newbies who have decided that immediately after finding us, they need to go read the Legendary Badfic. It&#39;s like you lot treat it like reading the legendary badfics is a test of manhood that seperates the newbie from the true boarder. Which it&#39;s really not. I mean, if you&#39;re looking for them because you&#39;re like me, and you enjoy reading badfic, go for it. But if you&#39;re doing it to prove something to yourself or the rest of the board, don&#39;t bother. They&#39;re just stories in the end. Stories that fundamentally Don&#39;t Get It, but still just stories.</p>

            <p>Well, at least the chapters are short. That&#39;s about the only good thing this fic has going for it though.<br><br>Going slightly off-topic; am I the only one that is amused by disclaimers which deny ownership of OCs? I quote from chapter 3 of this one: &#39;DISCLAIMER-I OWN NOTHING!&#39;<br>What, not even the character Sera and the concept of a tribute which isn&#39;t allowed to be attacked? I guess I must have missed those in my reading of the books...<br><br>Made even more (unintentionally) humorous in this case, due to a double negative in the disclaimer for chapter 4, which would seem to imply that Suzanne Collins was not the creator of Hunger Games; &#39;DISCLAIMER; DON&#39;T OWN NOTHIN&#39;!&#39;<br>Now if you own nothing, then you own... nothing; fairly simple and straightforward.

            <p>Wow, this is bad. I don&#39;t have any problem with the pairing during the chain arc, but this is really very bad. Didn&#39;t the author notice that Light *currently has no memory of the Death Note, and thus cannot think of writing down people&#39;s names in it*? Also, &quot;brunette&quot; for a male character is a pet peeve of mine, although it is acceptable if the POV character thinks he&#39;s a girl--which usually happens to Mello. And that author&#39;s note... I have to go repress my memories now. </p>

There&#39;s no punctuation, very sporadic capitalization, and bad spelling mixed in - and that&#39;s not even brought me to the complete lack of any sort of segue from the Space Marine scene to SUDDENLY HARRY!  And then suddenly Space Marines again.<br><br>  Not to mention inventing beer for the Space Wolves, and cowardly Space Marines to boot.  And giving his characters stupid names.  And implying that a Sergeant is still in Basic Training.  And putting Space Marines in robes, instead of the Power Armour WHICH THEY&#39;RE FRAKKING ATTACHED TO.  And defying...no, never mind, Warp travel isn&#39;t exactly the most reliable process to begin with.  Aaanyway, also having a Space Marine hiding behind a bush.  They don&#39;t MAKE bushes big enough to hide an 8-foot walking rapemachine, people.  <br><br>...Why am I mentally writing up a Charge list right now?  BAD Riese!  NO summary executions!</p>

            <p>First, Nanoha&#39;s last name is Takamachi. It&#39;s a Magical Girl show, but about five episodes into the first season it became epic. Now it&#39;s more of a mecha anime with many explosions and girls in cute costumes (their magic staffs are powered by cartridges! As in a revolver!). In any case, this badfic has nothing to do with it besides the first name and that it has magic in it. </p>

            <p>There aren&#39;t any Nanoha canon AUs that would fit this. In the main canon, there are three seasons, taking place at different points in the timeline, and two ongoing manga. There is also the Nanoha Portable canon, which is an AU that breaks off from the main canon at one point at the end of the second season. None of these have Nanoha Rukia, or have her teach as anything other than a magical/aerial combat instructor for a transdimensional police organization as an adult. </p>

            <p>But yeah.  I mean, there&#39;s really not much to that one (or its *shudder* sequel).  Dunno how I&#39;d even go about sporking it.  I think I&#39;ll leave that for some poor sap in Bad Slash.</p>

            <p>Sort of. My best friend (and longtime crush) got me into Bloodlines ages ago so that we could do RPs based on it. <br><br>I&#39;ve never played the actual game. But I&#39;ve watched a couple Let&#39;s Plays, including the INCOMPARABLY funny Marik Plays Bloodlines.<br><br>...Did she seriously forget that [SPOILERS DO NOT READ] Therese and Jeanette are the same person?? Seriously? I figured that out by their first argument. &gt;_&gt; <br><br>And SOMEONE obviously has the hots for the Prince. Gall, I always thought he was a smug [CENSORED]. *is an Anarch to the core... and Nines Rodriguez may or may not be one of my L.O.s* <br><br>...Speaking of which. WHAT. WHAT THE PROVERBIAL FORK. Nines Rodriguez is NOT &#39;gross&#39;!! And Damsel can be a beeyotch, yes, but she&#39;s NOT a shallow beeyotch who humps Nines&#39; leg!! NINES WOULD NOT GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT. The HELCK. <br><br>WHAT IN THE NAME OF THE DEAR AND FLUFFY LORD?! I&#39;m a Republican! That&#39;s NOT what we think! And I shop at Hot Topic and I&#39;m NOT A CUTTER. This suethor is MAKING ME HATE HER.<br><br> I must not flame. Flame is the mind-killer....<br><br>Okay. I would be HAPPY to work with you on this. ...Vernet and Mundar wouldn&#39;t work so well here (neither of them know canon, and neither of them are particularly interested in vampires). <br><br>But I have an agent who&#39;s going to be rescued from Dark Yagami. She&#39;s referred to only as &#39;The Girl From The Bus&#39;. She tried to kill the Stu, and in a fic like that, that&#39;s a bright little ray of sunlight. Of course, you&#39;ll need to get rid of her ability to use five guns at once... but a quick stint in the reality room can fix that, and some anti-lustin can fix her... other qualities. <br><br>She&#39;s going to need some training and a partner. Maybe this mission can be her first? </p>

Also, the unnamed protagonist manages to hold off three of the most dangerous characters in the game at once (admittedly, he has the two of the highest-level demons available and a misspelled version of another, but once he&#39;s dodging Sinner&#39;s Song, Requiem, Charge+Adaptation, and Chaos Tack <i>all at once</i>, he&#39;s still gonna be having some freakin&#39; trouble).</p>

            <p>I have found a fanfiction that makes me want to destroy the author&#39;s house from orbit. It&#39;s so terrible that an entire sub-culture grew around the fic that focused on killing one of the characters in it due to the evils of it.<br><br>It&#39;s incredibly NSFW. VERY, VERY NSFW. IT IS ALSO INCREDIBLY EVIL.<br><br>To summarise it, eight year old girl from Tenchi Muyo arrives in real life. Is promptly brutally raped and murdered by pedophile.<br><br>That is a simplified summary on the Barge Pole Threads of Spacebattles.<br><br>I clicked on the link. Then I promptly closed it after a minute or so.<br><br>NSFW. Incredibly NSFW. VERY NSFW.<br><br>You know what, I&#39;m not even going to give a link. It is just named Kanashii no Imi.

            <p>Hi Artic,<br><br>I started reading your fic during my lunchbreak today; I must say I was surprised to encounter E=mc<sup>2</sup> in a Pokйmon piece, and that intrigued me enough to carry on reading. Didn&#39;t read all the chapters, because I ran out of time, but I enjoyed what I did read. <br><br>I&#39;m only vaguely familiar with this continuum, but if you&#39;re still in need of a Beta then I&#39;d be willing to help out. I&#39;ll certainly be able to check the story for internal consistency and SPaG (although from what I&#39;ve read so far you don&#39;t seem to have problem with that), but may less useful when it comes to spotting OOCness etc. <br><br>So, yeah, I may not be able to do a full Beta of it, but I can volunteer my services as a &#39;Gamma&#39; (a term I&#39;ve possibly just invented to describe someone that can&#39;t necessarily fulfil all the duties of a Beta, but is willing to give it a shot anyway).<br><br>And there&#39;s always the chance that by bumping it to the top of the page again, it&#39;ll attract the attention of someone else that knows more about Pokйmon than I do.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ll let you know. Seems due to the lack of interest, I may turn to you for it.<br>As for OOCness, most of the fanfiction deals with OCs. The Canon characters only have small cameos, and rarely large enough to establish much of their personality. They&#39;re more references to establish with continuum we&#39;re in (Anime).<br><br>Other than that, it&#39;s an original location, with some original Pokйmon and concepts. I&#39;m part of an old group of fanfic writers who joined together and let the others use their created regions and Pokйmon. From what I can tell, I&#39;m the only one still active though.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;ll let you know regardless :)</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m a newbie here, as seen by the fact that I just introduced myself in another post earlier today.

            <p>Well I&#39;ve read Celebrian. It&#39;s ... just a story that involves objectification of women IN A FANTASY SETTING written by a person with really weird fetishes. I&#39;ve seen worse.<br><br>Cupcakes, which I read before to see what the fuss was about, is just very descriptive gore. Very descriptive gore. And somewhat creepy. But it wasn&#39;t that bad.<br><br>My Immortal is just wish fulfilment. Badly written wish fulfilment. It also lacks characterisation.<br><br>legolas by laura is more wish fulfilment. I think most of the problems people have with it is the terrible plot, the terrible writing and the fact that &#39;laura&#39; is ten years old and was tortured and raped by orcs. And that she gets into a relationship with her adopted brother. Other than that, it&#39;s just another average Mary Sue fic.</p>

            <p>The introductory info you give is excellent stuff!  It&#39;s a very thorough summary of the PPC&#39;s usual equipment and its uses for the agents.<br><br>I think there&#39;s a section missing around the entrance to the badfic itself, as the agents never actually enter it.

            <p>In fact, I kinda wanted this mission to be a &quot;tutorial&quot; about current PPC missions (as the TOS is starting to be outdated for that IMHO. The PPC changed a lot.)<br><br>I corrected the typo, but about the other issue I think you missed a bit. After the scene break, Nikki asks Sergio how she looks, and since to activate the disguise they need to step through the portal is implied that they entered the fic.<br><br>However, now that you make me think about it, the whole piece can be understood in a different way (Nikki showing her disguise selection to Sergio on the screen of the console).

            <p>It&#39;s a bit of a fiddly job, but it&#39;s probably the clearest way to do it. Now, to business!<br><br><b>From the personal files of Terri Ryan, Department of Personnel</b><br><br>Well, this is interesting. I&#39;m pretty sure records of agents&#39; training are supposed to be confidential... on the other hand, this is a mission report, so I suppose that doesn&#39;t apply. Still, it makes an interestingly different read. Let&#39;s see.<br><br>I find this report to be a very good introduction to PPC proceedures. Agent, er, Nikki fills the role of &#39;naive protagonist&#39; perfectly - she&#39;s clever enough that things don&#39;t need to be beaten in the ground, but ignorant enough to make the introductions she gets purposeful. I may recommend to the Marquis that we give copies of this to new recruits, to teach them what we&#39;re about. I particularly like the fact that the training doesn&#39;t stop when they enter the fic - Sergio is clearly a natural at this.<br><br>On the other hand, I&#39;m sorry to say he seems a little too fond of his own voice. The vast majority of his report is dialogue, often with no tags to indicate who is talking - although <i>that</i> isn&#39;t an issue, he shows us his personality and Nikki&#39;s very well, so I can tell who&#39;s who. Nevertheless, the constant speech is a little tiring - I&#39;d appreciate a little description at times, not so much of the surroundings, but of Nikki&#39;s reactions. Body language is still language, and I&#39;m sure she had some.<br><br>On the subject of reactions... I&#39;ve never met Sergio or Nikki in person (I don&#39;t get out much), but they come across as very hard-hearted. Sergio admits that Sakura is his Lust Object, and yet has barely any response to watching her be raped. Perhaps he&#39;s a recent transfer from Bad Slash, but I wonder whether he&#39;s simply blocking the memory - to the unfortunate detriment of his report.<br><br>But perhaps I&#39;m being too harsh. Certainly his reactions towards the end were genuine - both the attraction and the embarassment - so he clearly has a normal emotional range. Perhaps his purpose in this report was to present his training of Nikki in a clear, unadorned manner, and he decided to cut out his own reactions for clarity&#39;s sake. Either way, I think he is worth watching - not that I have any choice in what reports I receive. Still, I&#39;d like to read more.<br><br>-T. Ryan, Dept. of Personnel, DOGA Archivist<br><br></p>

            <p>And I&#39;m glad you liked it.<br><br>All right, about the big blocks of text, that&#39;s a bad habit of mine. I&#39;m trying to break out of it, but it&#39;s probably still going to take a while. I&#39;m going to write next a mission from back when he didn&#39;t have a partner as an execise for that - without anyone to talk to, I&#39;m forced to keep his mouth shut and use more action than dialogue.<br><br>About him and Nikki being hard-hearted, here&#39;s why:<br><br>Nikki: She&#39;s a Sakura replacement I took from a fic called &quot;The Final Ever After&quot;. I was going to kill this fic at first, but as I wasn&#39;t able to figure out what was it supposed to be I dediced to leave it alone (although I got there the inspiration for Nikki). She had quite of a rough time during it, in fact the PPC world is less grim than the one she&#39;s from.<br><br>Sergio: You were almost right with your deduction - he does suppress his own emotions as much as possible during missions. This time because he was focused on getting her training done as professionally as possible not only for her own sake, but also because he was in trouble with Upstairs due to his &quot;screw rules, I&#39;m doing the right thing&quot; attitude. In fact, getting fed up with whatever was happening to Sakura caused him to kill several badfics before having gathered all the necessary charges (Mission #1 and #2 are two of them). However, it&#39;s already shown in those that Sergio manages to (barely) keep his emotions in check even without that reason.<br><br>I&#39;m going to spoiler his backstory to explain that.<br><br>Sergio was from a massive crossover I wrote with some of my friends several years ago. During that time he was a borderline Stu and fell in love with Sakura, causing her to get in troubles only for him to save her, without knowing it. Sergio and his friends fought a lot of battles against a bunch of villains, always managing to foil their plans. At some point, Sergio&amp;Co. were in a future where the world was controlled by the villains, in order to discover their plan and so be able to counter it in the present. Then things went haywire. The villains managed to kill Sergio&#39;s cousin leading to Sergio&#39;s sister despairing. We stopped writing short after that.<br><br>However, the battle continued. Sergio&#39;s sister, due to her unstable mood, got killed too. Since she was the one with the time-control power, the others were stranded in a bad future, and while attempting to overthrow the villains all of Sergio&#39;s friends got killed one by one.<br>In a desperate action, Sergio managed to plant a bomb at one of the villains&#39; meeting, killing them all in one go.<br><br>The world was saved (but not safe, as there was no government), but Sergio was completely alone. Having somehow discovered the existence of Mary Sues and realized that he was a Stu himself, he began hunting them with suicidial perseverance, and got discovered by the PPC just before this vigilante life killed him.<br>He now tells everyone an altered version of the truth, claiming to be a clone of... well, himself, since he wants to forget all of that. Especially the fact that his previous Suvian nature ended up putting in danger (and eventually killing) the girl he was in love with.<br><br>He tries to block out emotions and memories of his pre-PPC past, since he thinks that they are dangerous to the people around him. And was working, as his lusting over Sakura steadily faded over time. (And, since he is now (2011 HST) 19 and Sakura&#39;s 10, it&#39;s a good thing)<br>The problem now is that he&#39;s partnered with basically a 16 years old Sakura, and that will bring out a past he wanted to forget.<br><br>Damn, I wrote a lot and I&#39;m not even sure I managed to say all.</p>

            <p>So, here&#39;s a quick explanation of Sergio&#39;s personality:<br><br>He has seen his Lust Object kidnapped and killed several times before even joining the PPC. Due to that being indirectly caused by being a Suvian back then, he sees every single CCS badfic as a punishment for that.<br><br>He will save her again and again, yes, but she doesn&#39;t remember him anymore. Most of the times, Sergio will not even hear a &quot;thank you&quot;. He&#39;s fine with that, but what he treasured most - the feeling that Sakura is now safe - is gone forever, as it doesn&#39;t matter how hard he tries, she will never be safe from badfic. The only way to avoid breaking down is to just ignore his own emotions on the matter, and keep doing his job in the best way possible.<br><br>However, what really haunts him is that every single one of the friends he had back then is dead, and he couldn&#39;t do anything to protect them. Corolla and Nikki, as the closest friends he has now, are now his only chance to finally exorcise that, so he tries to be nice, strong and professional to make them safe, and also feel safe.<br>Their happiness is the only thing that matters for Sergio now, and he will hide his inner demons from them because he doesn&#39;t want them to worry.<br><br>If something happens to them, Sergio is very likely to break down and become a death seeker again.</p>

            <p>I won&#39;t pass that on to Terri - she&#39;d probably start feeling guilty for criticising him. ;) Me, I don&#39;t know the meaning of the word guilt. Something to do with cabbage farming, right?<br><br>I think it&#39;s brilliant that PPC Agents have personalities and motivation all of their own (in fact I&#39;m sort of doing something about that right now), and I do hope he can manage to grow as a character and a person - preferably without going on a murder-spree, since that&#39;s not at <i>all</i> funny (usually).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You make me feel like a newbie... whatever.<br>Here&#39;s a real, authentic, working Piecemaker replica! Oh... wait... that might not be such a good idea. Let me scavenge for more stuff. <br>Oh, there you go! Have a mattock instead! You can use one side to mine for precious minerals, and the other to chop down trees. Or kill anybody who challenges your mining for precious minerals, but that&#39;s besides the point.<br>Or, you could just give it to a dwarf as a birthday present and he (or she) will be utterly overjoyed.</p>

            <p>&quot;July, you can&#39;t possibly-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hurry up!&quot; July looked behind at her partner- ran into a wall, which she twisted against at the last possible moment to use to continue her momentum in the direction she wanted to go- and returned her focus on the stretch of corridor in front of her. &quot;Do you really want to be late?&quot;<br><br>Library sighed, and picked up the edge of her skirts, and started chasing after her partner. &quot;No, but it&#39;s-&quot;<br><br>&quot;-Important!&quot; July turned to make sure Library was actually following again. &quot;Besides I set everything up and there is a less than zero zero zero zero zero desire on my part, personally, to have it vanish because people cannot not help themselves and then I would feel bad and then you should feel bad because I feel bad because everything would be rui- oooooooow.&quot; She had managed to run into someone. July collapsed to the floor in a mostly impressive manner, and looked at the ceiling dazedly. &quot;Hi......&quot; <br><br>Said other person had managed to use the corridor&#39;s wall as support, albiet with some grunting and what resulted in pain. &quot;Hello, July.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Samuel!&quot; July managed to spring from being flat on the floor to standing up. &quot;Whatareyoudoinghereyoushouldbeoverthereinsteadwhereeveryoneiswhatareyoudoingoutherewehavethingstodoohgodnothingisgoingtobe-&quot; A calloused hand pressed against her mouth.<br><br>&quot;July. Breathe.&quot;<br><br>She inhaled through her nose, and the hand pressed against her mouth was removed. &quot;-finishhedandwhatareyoudoinghereweneedtogogogogogogogo!&quot; With that, she started running again- this time trying to drag the much taller agent along with her.<br><br>&quot;Wha- Let go!&quot; He drug his heels in, which resulted in July&#39;s attempted death grip on his hand slipping away, sending her off even faster in her intended direction.<br><br>&quot;Hello, Samuel!&quot; Library soon ran past him, still trailing in July&#39;s wake. &quot;I hope to see you soon! I&#39;m so sorry about July!&quot; <br><br>&quot;MAKE SURE YOU BRING THE CAKE! AND CANDLES!&quot; July shouted from down the corridor, out of sight. <br><br>Library&#39;s response echoed. &quot;You already took care of that!&quot;<br><br>Several collisions with walls, four agents, and an especially surprised daisy later they had finally arrived at their destination, and July pried the door open, and entered. <br><br>One of the auditoriums had been put to use for this, and it was crammed full with people- and probably-people- that July had been able to round up from various places. Not all wore the PPC uniform- no badge, no black- but there was something they all had in common. <br><br>July looked around. &quot;She&#39;s not here yet, right?&quot;<br><br>A varied set of responses that were essentially &quot;No.&quot; filtered back to her. <br><br>&quot;Okay, that&#39;s good, I&#39;ll collapse against a wall later. Or maybe not, those seem to hate me today.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That would not have been such a problem if you actually paid attention to where you were going,&quot; Samuel groused, having walked in not too long after July and Library. &quot;How many other people did you run into?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uhhhhhhh four and a plant. And maybe a talking wall.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Aha.&quot; He didn&#39;t sound impressed.<br><br>July stuffed a noisemaker into his hand in reponse. <br><br>Someone ran in, and quickly closed the door behind them. &quot;She&#39;s almost here!&quot;<br><br>July inhaled sharply. &quot;Man your stations!&quot;<br><br>Everyone in quickly moved around, and soon it was very quiet inside the auditorium until the door opened and a young woman entered....<br><br><font size="6">&quot;Happy 20th Birthday, Makari!&quot;</font><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m enjoying seeing someone doing the Intel Reports the Agents rely on. As for the rest of my review, I&#39;ll hand that over to someone in need of a hobby (or, as her department mates put it, &#39;life&#39;).<br><br><b>From the personal files of Terri Ryan, Department of Personnel</b><br><br>I honestly have no idea what&#39;s going on any more. After that wodge of old reports I was sent, I assumed that was it - but now I&#39;m receiving current Intelligence reports for some reason? Well, at least it&#39;s more interesting than Gen&#39;s latest origami-report (space-warping powers, yes; paper-folding, not so much).<br><br>I find Agent De Grasse&#39;s (Gaspard&#39;s?) depiction of life in Intel&#39;s Action Division endlessly fascinating. I didn&#39;t even know they <i>had</i> a cubicle farm, but Gaspard makes it not only a learning experience, but entertaining as well. His colleague Angus takes constructive console abuse to a new level, and my only complaint is that I find myself a little confused over the scale of the whole thing. The only number given is a cubicle address, &#39;Cubicle 5294, Stupidity Lane&#39;, which even by the most conservative estimates gives well over 10,000 Intel Action Agents. I think we would have noticed that - but then again, I suppose consecutive numbering never did catch on here.<br><br>I do have to query Gaspard&#39;s interpretation of his interaction with the DIA. From what I&#39;ve seen, DIA operatives may be dismissive, but they never display the overt contempt Gaspard describes. Either a member of their team was having a seriously bad day (which I&#39;m sure the Tiger Lily would never allow), or Gaspard is exaggerating somewhat (and in a less generous frame of mind I might say &#39;making it up&#39;). Presumably what actually happened was that he told them his RA <i>might</i> be broken, and refused to explain further - or, of course, that earpiece of his (do Intel have those?) was a prank given to him by persons unknown. You never can tell with agents.<br><br>Nevertheless, I did reach the end of this report satisfied that my time had not been wasted. Gaspard&#39;s slow realisation of exactly <i>what</i> sort of predicament he was in is near-perfect - and I firmly approve of his decision to let certain quotes from the &#39;fic stand on their own. Those lines don&#39;t require narrative commentary, and I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t offered.<br><br>-T. Ryan, Dept. of Personnel, DOGA Archivist</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the concrit! I&#39;ll be sure to take these points into consideration for further missions.<br><br>On the scale of the DoI: in my mind I imagine only a quarter of Intelligence operatives working at a time in the Action Division, the rest being on sorting duty. The cubicle maze is huge (think Sorting Room size), with up to five agents operating off of a single cubicle.<br><br>I didn&#39;t think of the interaction with the DIA officer like that. Thanks for pointing it out. I needed an explanation for why Gaspard just couldn&#39;t portal out when he realized things were going downhill. Since the home console unit was malfunctioning, the RA would be useless so he would need to rely on outside support, hence the multiverse communications earpiece. &quot;Mr. No&quot; was my answer to why HQ couldn&#39;t just get him out immediately. Looking back on the passage with fresh eyes I agree that it does look a little extreme, so I&#39;ll be sure to pay attention to things like these in the following reports.<br><br>Thank you again for your concrit!</p>

            <p>Fun!  I had a lot of fun reading this mission.  I love how Aperture Labs itself tries to fight off the Sue.  It feels like the Original Series missions, where the canon would directly help Jay and Acacia stop the Sue.  I also like all the description you give the Labs.<br><br>I might have liked to see Gaspard&#39;s encounter with the wayward console after he got back to HQ, but perhaps we&#39;ll learn of that in a later installment?<br><br>Also, in the &quot;Description&quot; section at the end, you have the word &quot;better&quot; doubled in the sentence about Twilight.<br><br>Finally, the Wiki does make brief mention of claiming protocol for intelligence reports:<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Intelligence/Reports"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Intelligence/Reports">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Intelligence/Reports</a></a><br>&quot;All stories should also be found on either the Unclaimed Badfic or Claimed Badfic pages.&quot;<br>Which I&#39;m guessing means the link to the report should be attached under the badfic&#39;s entry, regardless of whether the badfic is currently claimed or unclaimed--and maybe on the killed list too?  Anyone else have thoughts on this?</p>

This time, I think I had a much better sense of how the fic works, and how Gaspard <i>really</i> didn&#39;t want to be there. So I think those are two really great things that have improved over the course of the last mission.

            <p><b>From the personal files of Terri Ryan, Department of Personnel</b><br><br>And so it continues. What is this, Implausible Crossovers? That&#39;s Narto&#39;s old department... oh, Nar.<br><br>Okay. Pull myself together. Bad Terri, no reminiscing. Review. If I keep this up, the R&amp;R Division will give me a part-time job.<br><br>I am quite terrified at the prospect of agents being given three missions at once, even short ones such as these - think of the filing! But if it has to happen, these three were a good match for each other. I&#39;m surprised Agents Florestan and Eusabius didn&#39;t protest more, but I note that their file shows them to have a rather antique origin, so perhaps they were simply too polite.<br><br>The presentation of the differing styles of the three fics - script, centred, parenthetical - was masterful; I truly felt the agents&#39; pain as they found themselves in each new situation. Perhaps the least fleshed-out was the centred story - it is mentioned once, and is amusing, but seems to fade into the background. I&#39;m sure they felt the pressure of that centring more than they let on - and perhaps they should have written more about it. For someone like me, stuck in the Archives all day, it would have been an interesting read.<br><br>I do wonder at the language the pair use - look, it&#39;s even affecting me. I&#39;m inclined to wonder whether they&#39;re playing on some reputation they have in HQ (I wouldn&#39;t know) and exaggerating their formality somewhat in the retelling. My suspicions on this front are strengthened by the fact that they occasionally slip into colloquial speech - the final &#39;Let&#39;s do this!&#39; is one example. On the other hand, who knows? We&#39;ve had stranger folk in here.<br><br>One point I do take issue with is during the climax of their third mission: one of the agents, Florestan, gives a &#39;review&#39; to an author-wraith (described as a Sue-wraith, which I believe is department policy - precision is vital in DIC, where Sue-wraiths and slash-wraiths are both common). Unfortunately, this &#39;review&#39;, while appropriate in tone, nevertheless blurs towards being a flame. An insulting term is used towards the writer of the story - which <i>is</i> frowned on in most departments (the proposal for a Department of Author Abuse never got off the ground). My only consolation is that I&#39;m inclined to think this &#39;review&#39; was never actually given - it reads like a &#39;brilliant retort I would have made&#39;.<br><br>On the whole, though I admit to not having any knowledge of the canons involved, I found this suitably entertaining. A few flaws, but far better than those agents who refuse to release their reports at all. I&#39;d much rather have <i>something</i> to read than nothing.<br><br>-Terri Ryan, Dept. of<br><br>-- oh yes, and I found a bizarre piece of overprinting in my copy. The &#39;fourth wall&#39; line in the third mission, for some reason, has folded on top of itself. Strange.<br><br>-T. Ryan, Dept. of Personnel, DOGA Archivist</p>

            <p>Y&#39;know, this is kinda meta for me, because one of my future Floaters missions might involve an in-universe conversation that&#39;s transcribed from actual PM messages I wrote over someone else giving their badfic to me to spork it. So before we know it, we&#39;ll be having a lot of things to deal with.<br><br>They are simply too polite. It also doesn&#39;t help that there&#39;s a meta thing involved with them that you don&#39;t <i>really</i> need to know to understand them, but that helps with them. Basically, Florestan and Eusebius were imaginary personalities used by Robert Schumann that Schumann used when he criticized stuff. So apart from a slight name change on Eusabius&#39; part, it&#39;s basically because they were kinda made to yell at stuff.<br><br>Honestly, the centered format of the second story didn&#39;t really bother me all that much. What did bother me was the content and how mixed the messages were, such as Sonic and Tails commenting about how horrible the things that were happening to Bowser Jr. were and doing absolutely nothing about it. Things like that irked me more than the formatting, but it also has surprisingly little to do with canon. This is especially so when you consider that Bowser Jr. was already having a hand in kidnapping the Princess in his first appearance in <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>.<br><br>Generally, Eusabius is always relatively formal, and Florestan is much more informal. That&#39;s the general rule I tend to follow.<br><br>That was intended more as a &#39;brilliant retort&#39;. Florestan can get rather... <i>angry</i> at things pretty easily. If he&#39;s not ranting at least once per mission, it&#39;s probably because it&#39;s bordering on goodfic. As of now, I haven&#39;t left a review on his fic, and I certainly would never use that kind of language if I did leave reviews on something I&#39;ve PPC&#39;d.<br><br>So yeah. Crazy times are had.

            <p>Ah, I see.<br><br>I&#39;m currently slogging through Cheerilee&#39;s Garden. That fic is... disturbing, to put it mildly (all the good prose doesn&#39;t help when Cheerilee is horribly OOC and happily murdering all the kids on a very flimsy premise). Also, need to finish Chapter 15 and 16 of MV3 (MLP fanfics are hogging all my time! D: ).<br><br>Yeah, and that makes a story interesting too. I wish I can write that well eventually. =x</p>

            <p>Ahh, I remember Banjo-Kazooie. That game was such a large part of my first steps as a gamer.<br><br>Anyways, the mission itself was an enjoyable read.

            <p>Yep, Banjo-Kazooie... That was a crazy series.

            <p>The three mini-fics thing is kind of fun.  Each badfic was different enough from the others to make for an interesting sporking in its own right.<br><br>One thing didn&#39;t seem consistent though.  At the end of the first badfic&#39;s section, Florestan seems to figure out that Eusabius is planning to go on a date with Zerenze.  However, he should already know this, because Eusabius flat-out told him before they left on the mission, &quot;I have a very important date today . . . I was going to take Zerenze to World One and a Half . . .&quot;<br><br>Also, since this is the first appearance of the mini-Jinjos, it would have been nice of you to say more about them beyond that they were &quot;colored strangely, and looked quite odd.&quot;  Some of us never played any <i>Banjo-Kazooies</i>, and hence don&#39;t know what a Jinjo is.</p>

            <p>Yeah, they were all different enough. They would&#39;ve made short missions if I had tackled them all individually, though, almost too short for a mission, I think.<br><br>Hm... Yeah, that would be a bit more suggestive, wouldn&#39;t it? Okay. I changed that dialogue, so thanks for catching that!<br><br>I also stretched out the description of the mini-Jinjos, so... yeah.<br><br>Thanks for hte feedback!</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed it. I think I remembered in one of the Floater&#39;s troll-fic missions that I lost track of the location (or maybe it was just my poor attention span),<br>but it&#39;s definitely improved here.<br><br>There are some things I want to point out:<br><br>It looked like you overdid it when attempting to mock their chatspeak since some of the words in one of the badfics were actually not in chatspeak.<br><br><i>“Eusabius, would you be so kind as to escort Grunty back to L.O.G.’s video game factory?[&quot;]</i><br><br>I thought they already were in L.O.G&#39;s video game factory, unless the place they were in was a fake.<br><br><i>“Don’t you push me, you fat <b>man</b>; walk through it myself, I certainly can!”</i><br><br>I thought they would still be hedgehogs by the time this was said, since I couldn&#39;t find any indication that they&#39;re disguises changed back. <br><br>There were a few &quot;soon after&quot;s and I think someone mentioned not to use that phrase again.<br><br>Other than that, it was fun to read! The imagery of Sonic&#39;s head spiking things cracked me up.<br></p>

            <p>Yeah, establishing location has been something I&#39;ve been trying to do better. It&#39;s good to see it&#39;s paid off!<br><br>For the mocking the chatspeak: do you remember which badfic it was that I overdid it with?<br><br>They weren&#39;t in L.O.G.&#39;s video game factory, actually. The Words were pretty clear that it wasn&#39;t L.O.G.&#39;s factory, IMO.<br><br>On my use of man: I had to maintain the thing about Grunty where all of her lines utilize bad rhyme. If this were a mission set in <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>, then it wouldn&#39;t be an issue, but since this was set after Grunty&#39;s bad rhymes came back, I had to work with a rhyme scheme. And try as I might, I could <i>not</i> figure out how to rhyme &#39;hedgehog&#39; with something that could approximate &quot;I can do it myself&quot; while maintaining a sense of rhythm within the line. (Well, that, and I have a really hard time getting things to rhyme, so...) Hence, why &#39;man&#39; is there instead of &#39;hedgehog&#39;.<br><br>*facepalm* Aw, crap. And I was trying <i>so</i> hard not to use that, too! (That was Phobos who said that, BTW.)<br><br>Thanks!</p>

            <p>When I said one of the badfics, I meant the one of the ones you just sporked. The characters in the Sonic and Dead Space crossover spelled words like &quot;what&quot; and &quot;the&quot; correctly most of the time, but when they&#39;re mocked, the words have the more typical chatspeak spelling such as &quot;wat&quot; and &quot;da&quot;. Just a nitpick.<br><br>About L.O.G&#39;s factory, I should have read that more carefully. My mistake.<br><br>I don&#39;t think Grunty had to use the word &#39;hedgehog&#39; to describe Eusabius in his disguise. I think Sonic had been called a &#39;rat&#39; or a &#39;rodent&#39; a few times, so maybe those kind of words could work. Then again, I&#39;d have the same problem with getting things to rhyme.<br><br>Thanks for clearing it up!</p>
