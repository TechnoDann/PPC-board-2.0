            <p>Sorry I haven&#39;t been around in a while, guys. I&#39;ve been busy a thousand times over with exams and a collaborative project I&#39;m working on elsewhere.<br><br> I was disappointed to find out that Sweet Apple Massacre was already taken. I was going to kill it as a first mission once I got permission, but whatever. I can&#39;t wait to read the sporking. I wanted to give the Big Mac substitute the worst I could without it being torture. I read it in its entirety, and quite frankly I&#39;m horrified at what Trolls can do. I thought I&#39;d seen it all with That Series and Tubgirl, but I suppose the Ironic Overpower and Legal got the best of me again.<br><br> I also read My Little Dashie, which made me dissolve into a puddle of sobbing man-mush and has forever changed the way I look at rainbows. And Cupcakes, which induced a twitchy trigger finger and has made me entirely unable to eat the baked good it was named for.<br><br> That&#39;s the other thing I was busy with: MLP: FiM. I know I&#39;m not the only Brony here, which is great. And, even if I was, I know you guys wouldn&#39;t be asses about it. Just another reason to be glad for this community. Anyone who wants to discuss ponies with me is welcome to do so.<br><br> So, is anything crazy happening out there? Any new Legendary Badfic I ought to be aware of? Anyone else here wish Bleeprin was a real thing? *needs Bleepka- a lot of it*<br><br> Also, what are the regs on new Bleep products?<br><br> And what about things that are generally illegal on World One, such as drugs or certain types of weapons like chemical or biological ones? I know HQ has rules, but I don&#39;t know exactly how tight things are.<br><br> I ask these questions because I had ideas which would be illegal on World One, but might work out okay in HQ, provided the regs didn&#39;t forbid them. For instance, chemical and biological weapons would be useful in clearing large numbers of bit characters who are hurting canon, and certain drugs would probably make the best Bleep products ever, provided there isn&#39;t an explosion on contact.<br><br> I&#39;m also wondering whether anyone has come across interesting pairings lately. Preferably realistic ones. Different is good, but outlandish is generally bad.<br><br> And I want to know something about Luna and Celestia. Would they be OOC Immune, or just Resistant? I don&#39;t really have a precise scope on the level of their power, so it would be helpful to know.<br><br> Well, best wishes!</p>

            <p>Looking for really bad MLP fic? Tawaki posted some further down this page. <br><br>If you&#39;re wondering about OOC resistance in Luna or Celestia, I would say they&#39;d be about on the same level as the other characters, if only for the canon-warping abomination that is Princess Molestia.<br><br>As for your question on bio/chem weapons, I&#39;d say anything forbidden by the Laws of War should be observed. Besides, spreading something like the Black Death on a canon location seems like overkill, no? (Not to mention it being a really, really horrible death...) Remember that bit characters can assimilate into canon when the Suefluence is gone. <br><br>Drugs, in my mind, are right out. <br><br></p>

            <p>But wouldn&#39;t Celestia and Luna be extraordinarily powerful?

Plug me.<br><br> Who says the location is canon? And what about things like chlorine gas being used to clear a room full of Sues and Replacements? It&#39;s a horrible way to die, but I&#39;m not sure if it crosses over into torture.<br><br> Also, ever heard of Trollestia?</p>

            <p>Well, that all depends on precise time period and the like. Also, if I really wanted to get nitpicky and off-topic, I could say that chlorine gas is not a poison, as it does not directly interfere with your body&#39;s internal workings, but works by destroying the organs rather than stopping their function or using their functions to kill you- in this case, the organs are destroyed through suffocation. It does not cause any reaction from things like the immune system. The venom of a BRO is a poison. Arsenic is a poison. Lead is a poison. Nickel is a poison. Carbon monoxide is a poison, as it prevents red blood cells from functioning. Chlorine is not a poison. It destroys the lining of the lungs, and drowns the victim on zir own blood. But that&#39;s irrelevant. So I don&#39;t know why I brought it up. Just for fun, I guess. *shrugs*<br><br> Also, if you look at it from a less literal perspective, that also outlaws things like teargas and knockout gas- things that might be useful for Departments like Bad Slash, who, for the most part, aim to incapacitate and exorcise rather than kill, and which are used regularly to disperse rioters in the US, Canada, and other countries.<br><br> And what about DoGA&#39;s Sun Crushers? They destroy entire star systems. It is a more extreme circumstance, yes, but still.<br><br> And I suppose that bit characters don&#39;t always have to die. Some could be recruited, or even beneficial to canon once the Sue dies. Just look at Snapshot.<br><br> But let&#39;s just agree to disagree. This be not a place for fighting. The PPC has enough problems externally. Let&#39;s not make internal ones as well.</p>

            <p><i>Lethal gases</i> were what I had in mind when I posted the comment. Tear/knockout gas is acceptable. I&#39;ve read enough accounts of First World War soldiers being gassed to death to decide that gas as weapon is totally inhumane.<br><br>Personally, if I&#39;d have to write an execution, I&#39;d choose something instantaneous and painless. <br><br>But as you said, we all have our own ideas on assassination methods, so let&#39;s leave it be.<br><br></p>

            <p>I think Celestia is pretty useless as a deity. Sure, she governs night and day, but any time a big threat like Nightmare Moon or Discord shows up, she sends six ordinary ponies to do her work for her. She&#39;s used the Elements of Harmony before, so why can&#39;t she do it now? Laziness?<br><br>Also, welcome back.</p>

            <p>She can&#39;t, because she lost her connection to the Elements. She and Luna split the Elements, so when Luna was gone, she could no longer use them, since (as one comic put it) she&#39;d lost her only friend.</p>

            <p>Deity versus deity tends to escalate up to the &#39;nukes&#39; level of power; a classic way of preventing that sort of thing from occurring, which all the way back to some of the very oldest myths, was to send off a mortal or two either completely with their wits alone or with a vested powerful item and see how they fare, or choose &#39;em to do the deciding.  <br><br>If it works, fantastic, you&#39;ve prevented far more damage from happening than might have otherwise with an all out fight between two or more very powerful beings. </p>

            <p>First off, a grammar thing.<br><br><i>“The last group of minis who tried to have fun with him was threatened.”</i><br><br>The subject is odd here. I think changing who into the singular that fixes this issue. <br><br>I guess that&#39;s my first good point: that was the only SPaG issue I personally saw, so good job on that.<br><br>I also really liked the army of mini-Discords, well, acting like Discord. Playing keep away with the RA was funny, as well as mildly tormenting the agents.<br><br>There were some issues, though. First off, the beginning part, before the minis steal the RA, reads like an MST. I don&#39;t really have a sense of the agents being there. The same thing occurs again after the brief fun with the mini-discords. Tieing into this, I forgot that the agents were disguised as ponies until the end when it&#39;s brought up again. I think it was mentioned twice during the whole mission. (At one point, a hoof is mentioned.) This seems odd; shifting into something with a non-human anatomy seems like it would be a bigger deal. So maybe more should have been made of that. As far as length goes, good job! This was short enough that I could easily read it, but long enough that I got a good sense off the fic. So yeah, it was a pretty good mission overall, just some things to keep in mind.<br><br>(I also disagree with your assessment of whether or not this is trollfic, but that really isn&#39;t a big deal.)<br><br></p>

            <p>1) Yeah, I wasn&#39;t really able to make things interesting for the agents until the minis came in and wreaked havoc, especially in the first chapter of the fic. That was kind of where things were &#39;blah&#39;, but I had to set up that I didn&#39;t think that Rainbow Dash was doing stuff that was so far out of canon that she couldn&#39;t see her canon self with her own two eyes. As for the third chapter, I felt I had to let the &#39;WTF&#39; quality of the ending speak for itself. <br><br>2) Yeah, the ponies issue could&#39;ve been described better. Here&#39;s the thing about the agents getting used to pony anatomy, though: I already had them do that during this RC&#39;s Mission 5, which was also a My Little Pony crossover. There I had them do more with their pony forms, though that was also a function of the fact that they were actively dealing with a word cyclone.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>(I don&#39;t think it&#39;s trollfic, because really, some things that are done here I can see happening in canon as far as Rainbow Dash practicing new tricks. As for trollfics... I&#39;ve got a fic I&#39;m <i>convinced</i> is a trollfic coming up as my next Floaters mission, so...)</p>

            <p>A absolutely terrible mission, told in a really entertaining way.  I did a mission once with eight minis in and thought that was bad, but 23 is just taking the biscuit.  Surely it HAS to be a Troll fic.  Either that or written by someone who dropped out of school at Kindergarten level.<br><br>Nonetheless, as I said, entertainingly told and looking forward to seeing Florestan and Eusabius deal with something a little tamer next time.

            <p>Well, I&#39;m not asking for Permission just yet- I haven&#39;t been active enough for you to know me- but I will once more when I think you guys have a good handle on what sort of person I am. I&#39;ve been thinking about what Department I ought to join. On one hand, I hate Sues. On the other, I also detest fics like That Series, Sweet Apple Massacre, Cupcakes, and Molestia, for obvious reasons- and they might come under DAVD or Bas Slash rather than DMS. I&#39;m looking at Floaters, but I&#39;m not entirely sure. Multiple continua, multiple hated badfic varieties. It&#39;s why Floaters was created, yeah? But I&#39;m not absolutely certain.<br><br> Also, I was wondering about scalping a Sue or a Replacement before killing it. The reason for this is that, in some circumstances, the body may disappear once the Replacement or Sue has been killed- thus leaving poor little me with no trophy to show off later. I need to know just how far I can go before it crosses over into torture, so my Agent(s) can get a stern talking to from their Flower if need be.<br><br> I&#39;m sorry if anything I&#39;m asking sounds ridiculous, but it&#39;s better to know now, right?</p>

            <p>As a Boarder, you don&#39;t join a Department. Your Agents do it, and you can always get them reassigned if you end up not liking your initial choice.<br><br>I&#39;d say to start with Floaters, and then make your Agents &quot;specialize&quot; when you get an hang on what you prefer sporking. Or let them stay as Floaters, so you can spork whatever you get into you hands and like to write a mission about.<br><br>About the Sue Scalps, I&#39;d say that still falls under &quot;torture&quot;. And if it doesn&#39;t, well... it&#39;s still kinda graphic, no matter how you write it. However, as you have control on your missions, you can try to always find a way to have an &quot;harvestable&quot; body, or you can go for Sue objects instead when that doesn&#39;t work. (Misplaced Katanas and other Sue weapons are great to hang on walls, and I heard that Cute Animal Friend fur can be used to make excellent rugs.)<br><br>Remember, however, that the main rules for PPC are good writing and having fun. So, as long as you get proper humor, you can pull of nearly anything.</p>

            <p>Seems about right.<br><br> As to scalping, it would be a Celestia Replacement I&#39;m looking at claiming for my first mission. The mane would be exquisite, no? That&#39;s why &quot;scalping&quot; instead of &quot;jacking the treasure&quot;. More of a nail it to the door like the snake on the little shack belonging to the Gaunts sort of thing, you know. Maybe I could have the body stay, and dispose of it in a creative way, like feeding it to whatever would eat it. Or maybe I could just jack the necklace and the crown. Maybe KO the replacement before scalping and then kill?<br><br> And I know that, when canon snaps back into place, non-canon places like the basement of Sugarcube Corner go away. And an Agent left in their goes with it, yeah? But what about a canon accidentally left in there? Let&#39;s say Fritz and Silias messed up and left Dash in the basement when they killed the Pinkie replacement (not that I think two such capable fellows would). What would happen to RD? Would she go where she belongs, as she would if she was upstairs, or would she vanish with the space?<br><br> CAFs, I&#39;ve heard, make good rugs, as well as, for the ladies, purses and other accessories. Like that unicorn Jay and Acacia had Lux skin. I heard the throw rug was quite pretty. But my Agents, well, they like their trophies to be a bit more terrifying. What would be scarier, a bunch bloodied pieces of jewelery and weapons in display cases, or a bunch of scalps nailed to the door?<br><br> On a side note, oh how I detest the Misplaced Katana. I understand why fangirls would choose it over, say, a scimitar, a saber, a kriss, or a morning star- it&#39;s a simple weapon, widely known and easy to envision, on top of being a pretty good one, provided you actually take proper care of it- but it&#39;s still annoying for one to be there without a damn good excuse.</p>

            <p>I say be honest with zir. Don&#39;t be brutally honest- reserve that for the people who really deserve it. Be an Applejack sort of honest. That is, tell her straight up, but try to phrase it nicely. If you don&#39;t tell zir nicely now, someone else will tell zir very rudely later on. Which is better, I ask of thee?</p>

            <p>Being that I have watched only a few episodes of the show, this should be interesting.  I&#39;m going to go in order of when things come up, since I will be making notes while reading.<br><br><b>Chapter 1:</b><br><br><i>&quot;Slow going,&quot; Glyph replied. &quot;We&#39;ve worked out the tweaks we needed to fix as far the central design goes.&quot;</i>  I believe you are missing an &#39;as&#39; at the end of that line.<br><br>Did I misunderstand something, or did Rarity walk off across campus at some point and then reappear in the conversation as if she hadn&#39;t left?<br><br>I&#39;m wondering where Fluttershy is during all of this.  Surely the Mane Six are all involved.<br><br><b>Chapter 2:</b><br><br>Hilarious. I know Bronies are often college aged, but it hadn&#39;t occurred to me that someone might be sitting around swearing, drinking and smoking while they talk about MLP.  It&#39;s so discordant.  I love it.<br><br>Also, the appearance of the letter was inspired.<br><br><i>He managed to catch about half of it,. The rest and his Zippo dropped onto the grass.</i>  Two problems.  1) The comma at the end of that first sentence.  2) How do you catch half a scroll?  These sentences could be clarified to make it more apparent that the scroll unraveled and had multiple pages, which is what I decided after reading it a few times.<br><br><b>Chapter 3:</b><br><br>I was expecting Terry from chapter 2 to be back in this one.  I guess we&#39;ll catch up with him later.<br><br><i>&quot;That question&#39;s a <b>miite</b> phi-lo-soph-i-cal, miss. Everything&#39;ll be explained inside. You best get along.&quot;</i>  I think you have an extra &#39;i&#39; in there.<br><br><i>The left and right walls both had doors which were currently closed, leaving the unlit corridor before her as only direction to go—deeper into the building.</i> I think it should be &quot;<b>the</b> only direction to go.&quot;<br><br><i>Bright colorful banners hung from the corridor&#39;s ceiling light wrapped wires, occasionally punctuating the darkness with &#39;WELCOME!&#39; and &#39;THIS WAY!&#39;.</i>  There is a problem in this sentence right around &quot;light wrapped wires&quot;.  I am not quite sure what you were going for, so I don&#39;t know how to fix it.<br><br><i>the path form the doors</i> Should be &#39;from&#39;.<br><br><i>After watching a few still-unsure-on-their-hooves ponies walk though, Heather warily followed, descending into the dimly lit auditorium.</i>  Something is off in this sentence.  I think it should be &#39;through&#39; instead of &#39;though&#39;.<br><br><i>and a several scattered throughout the various rows</i>  Take out the &#39;a&#39; and you should be fine.<br><br><i>Suddenly, the lights went off.</i>  Kinda disappointed that we don&#39;t find out if some of the Ponies DO glow in the dark.<br><br><i>and momentarily he appeared behind the stand</i> &#39;after a moment&#39; would be better.  Right now it seems like he appears behind the stand and then disappears.<br><br>The spotlight gags are good.  I assume the CMC are running tech?  They would not have been my first choice, but I am not usually going for comedy when I am doing tech.<br><br>Oh no!  Blank flanks!  The worst possible thing!  :P<br><br>You have done an excellent job keeping the cast in character, though I wonder why Luna was even there.  She didn&#39;t really add anything to the story.<br><br>The PPC ponies seem a little harsh for this environment, though I suppose that could just be an act to put the fear of the PPC into the students.  I will have to wait and see how that pans out.<br><br><b>Overall:</b> <br><br>The first half of chapter 3 was rough, due to some of the issues I pointed out earlier, but the story, descriptions, and characterization were excellent.<br><br>I am wondering what the classes are going to be, and which Ponies will be teaching what.  I suppose I will have to read further to find out.<br><br>Keep up the good work.<br><br>-Phobos, 20% more concrit in 10 seconds flat</p>

            <p>Sounds cool. Let&#39;s see what I can whip up here. Oh, and I&#39;ll try to criticize constructively, but that&#39;ll take a little longer, I think.<br><br><br>Name: Dr. Hitech<br><br>Gender: Male<br><br>Coloration: Cherry red with black mane/tail, bright green goggles<br><br>Favorite pony race: Unicorn. Why fly or kick trees when you have telekinesis?<br><br>Please specify one luxury item that you require at RFAE: A wrench made of solid gold.<br><br>I have: (Watched some of the episodes) Good enough, right?<br><br>I am: (What is Canon?) No, really, I don&#39;t even know what the word means.<br><br>I have written slash: (no) Though there are some pairings I&#39;ve been wanting to try. Vinyl Scratch and Octavia could use some more attention...<br><br>I have written a Mary Sue: (no) Of course not! Building a Gundam with standard pony technology is perfectly reasonable!<br><br>My favorite character is: (Twilight Sparkle) She&#39;s intelligent and has a keen scientific mind. That&#39;s why she&#39;s my lab assistant.<br><br>I am in love with a Canon character: (no) There&#39;s no time for love when you&#39;ve got a robot apocalypse to initiate!<br><br>If so, whom?: Even if I did have time for love, it most certainly wouldn&#39;t be someone like Pinkie Pie. Far too hyperactive, and she might break something important while bouncing around like a lunatic. That&#39;s why she was the first one to die in the robot apocalypse.<br><br>I have a fear of: (Princess Celestia/Nightmare Moon/Princess Luna/Other (Rarity, Discord)) I&#39;ve read those ask blogs. I know what they get up to in their spare time, and I want none of it. As for Discord, well...do I have to explain it? Reality warpers are just scary, not to mention that hideous mismatch of parts. He&#39;s like some kind of animal Frankenstein or something. It&#39;s a good thing he&#39;s not real.<br><br><br>After watching a few episodes scattered throughout Season One, the young man known on the internet as Dr. Hitech began writing a fanfiction series of his very own. Though he had a good grasp of spelling and grammar, his primary knowledge of canon came more from the various &quot;ask blogs&quot; than the show itself, twisting his view of the world of FiM.<br><br>In his stories, Celestia and Luna periodically molested their subjects, and the entire world was shrouded in darkness. But then, a pony called Dr. Hitech appeared to resist them! Rescuing Twilight Sparkle from the clutches of the eeeevil princesses, he made her his lab assistant and together they built an army of giant pony robots, with which they easily overthrew Celestia and banished Luna to the moon again.<br><br>Unfortunately, the author didn&#39;t want the story to end there, so he made it take a turn for the grimdark with a robot apocalypse and a time travel plot that blatantly ripped off Terminator. Naturally, his self-insert character was the hero of the pony resistance and would often angst melodramatically over his involvement in the situation.<br><br>This is probably where he got the &quot;invitation&quot; to the OFU.</p>

            <p>You really thought I wouldn&#39;t want this? Here goes, hahahaha!<br>*<br><br>Name: on Earth: Michael Portales; as a pony: Treble Clef<br><br>Coloration: black, with blue mane; if I can have a cutie mark, let it be a quarter note, as my special talent is music; either that or a pair of wings for flight, but that feels a little overdone, and I&#39;m a bit more use to planes than my own wings, and I&#39;d imagine the mechanics are quite different.<br><br>Favorite pony race: Earth/Pegasus/Unicorn: pegasus, easy. Dash and &#39;Shy are pegasi, and what could possibly beat out the joy of flying, besides the joy of music?<br><br>Please specify one luxury item that you require at RFAE: oh, dear sweet Celestia, this is a difficult decision. iPod. If there&#39;s no electricity I&#39;ll have a unicorn recharge it. <br><br>I have: Watched all the episodes once/Watched all the episodes many times/Watched some of the episodes/watched none of the episodes: All of them. And keeping up. I&#39;m kind of a nut for it. Which, I suppose, is why I&#39;m even filling out this form in the first place.<br><br>I am: Very Familiar with Canon/ Slightly Familiar with Canon/ Reasonable with Canon/ Minimally Knowledgeable about Canon/ What is Canon?: I&#39;m super-familiar with FiM canon, but not G&#39;s 1-3<br><br>I have written slash: yes/no: Yes, yes I have. Femmeslash, if you want specifications. No smut though: clop is bad.<br><br>I have written a Mary Sue: yes/no: I&#39;ve written a Gary-Stu. We all have. I seem to have trouble fixing mine, but that&#39;s what this OFU is for, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>My favorite character is: Twilight Sparkle/Rarity/Applejack/Fluttershy/Rainbow Dash/Pinkie Pie/Spike/Other (Please specify): Fluttershy, with ease. <br><br>I am in love with a Canon character: yes/no<br>If so, whom?: Fluttershy. For those who know me I may seem like more of an RD or Pinkie, but nope. Even the crazy guy needs someone quiet and calm in their life. Balance is important, isn&#39;t it? Well, that&#39;s my theory on why. No sense trying to figure it out, though. All I know is she&#39;s simply perfect. Sets my heart a-flutter, pardon the horrible, horrible pun.<br><br>I have a fear of: The Everfree Forest/Princess Celestia/Spiders/Nightmare Moon/Princess Luna/Being Banished to the Moon/Other (Please specify): pretty much all of the above except Everfree. After some of the fics I&#39;ve read on a dare, you&#39;d be scared of Their Majesties, too! Spiders are just kinda gross. Banished to the moon, I think it&#39;s obvious why I&#39;m scared of that. Same goes for Nightmare Moon. Also, certain badfics. You know which ones. I&#39;ll be hoping they don&#39;t manage to circulate around to me.<br><br>*<br><br> A few side notes on this character: it&#39;s me, but I&#39;m filling it out as if it was the person I was when I first started writing, but with a fascination for MLP, which is something real me only recently got into.<br><br> I&#39;d also like to give some specifications about him/me: with regards to music, he plays trumpet, euphonium, and a little snare, doing a fantastic job of that much. He/I doesn&#39;t/don&#39;t sing much, and isn&#39;t/am not great at it. Barely passable. Regarding his/my reference to planes: he&#39;s/I&#39;m part of the RCACS in his/my day-to-day life, so he&#39;s/I&#39;ve been up in small, single-engine aircraft many times, and found no greater pleasure besides music. &quot;Theoretically,&quot; he/I always say(s), &quot;I could fly one. Not legally, but it&#39;s a theory.&quot;<br><br> He/I also mentioned being crazy. It&#39;s a PPC Agent type of insanity. If you have any questions about his/my personality, feel free to PM me on the Pit or ask here. Please.</p>

            <p>So while going around the PPC Wikia to get an idea of things like Departments (Thinking of making OC&#39;s join Department of Mary Sues, I stumbled into a page called &quot;The Pit&quot;. AKA- Fanfiction.Net.<br><br>I&#39;m just asking if it&#39;s alright to post any PPC Cases (If any) I make and put them there- for example, I found this Star Wars story with a Gary Stu, and I&#39;d post the... what&#39;s it called, sporking? Whatever- I&#39;d post the thingy in the Star Wars archive.<br><br>But back to my point- I know there&#39;s so much bad stuff there, but is it only to find the crap of the day? </p>

            <p>If I recall it correctly, Fanfiction.net gained this nicknames not (or more probably not only) for the sheer amount of badfic that can be found there, but because the admins didn&#39;t think twice about getting rid of the Original Series after a complaint from one of the people whose badfic was sporked (thus showing that they considered less offensive canon-raping badly written fics that well-written tasteful mocking of them.)<br><br>Long story short, the Pit name stems from FF.net basically siding with the badfic authors during the Original Series.</p>

            <p>The Pit- or FFNet- is a funny place.<br><br> I actually hail from the Pit. It was where I started out, and it&#39;s where I do most of my work today.<br><br> It&#39;s kind of like walking into a dark mine, sans lamp. Sometimes you&#39;ll find a gem, but more likely than not you&#39;ll just haul up some rocks and dead rats. I am one of the few who has good enough vision to find more diamonds than rocks.<br><br> The thing is, there&#39;s a lot of badfic there. It&#39;s where a good chunk of your sporking material will likely come from. Cupcakes and Molestia started there, for instance, as well as My Immortal. It&#39;s also prone to Trolls. And don&#39;t even get me started on what happens in the Pit of Horny Weasels.<br><br> But there are also some goodfic authors there too. They post there for the wider audience. I&#39;ve seen a couple of things I would even consider Legendary Goodfic, such as &quot;The Urthblood Saga&quot;, which I believe all Redwall fans ought to read. It&#39;s also one of the places where most OFUs are posted.<br><br> Basically, if you venture into the Pit, be careful. You might come out with the motherload, or you might lose all faith in humanity. Or maybe both. You may be flamed, or you may be praised. A few others here also have accounts on the Pit. Try to find them. They&#39;ll help you out.</p>

            <p>The Pit itself tends to frown upon Sporkage, and to be fair back when PPC stuff was posted there it actually led to PPC badfic.<br><br>I&#39;m sure others will put it more eloquently, but I think you&#39;ll find it something of a resounding no.</p>

            <p>A lot of this is various types of rock. Hair bands, Classic heavy metal, Classic rock, Disco, Punk, Alternative, Chicago blues, Delta blues, Big band, Bluegrass, Old country (like Merle Haggard, Hank Williams), Some specific fast country songs (particularly from the 90&#39;s), Some Techno and Dance, Some Classical, Some Some old time Gospel songs, and Irish folk music (think The Dubliners.

            <p>My radio spends 99% of its time on the local classical station (the exception would be when the Nebraska football team is playing, so it&#39;s staying on classical until next August).<br><br>I listen to some classic rock, I think I have most of the Alan Parsons Project on CD.  I have a lot of classic jazz as well.  There&#39;s also a group called Brule (there should be an accent on that e) that I really like; it&#39;s a mix of contemporary music and traditional Native American.<br><br>I also own a lot of soundtracks.  My &quot;go-to&quot; CD for when I&#39;m having trouble writing an RPG scenario is the full soundtrack for &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, it&#39;s especially good for fight scenes ;) .<br><br>If I&#39;m trying to do something, I prefer to put a pure instrumental on.  Vocals in a language I don&#39;t understand work as background music as well, but if I understand the words I end up following along with the words and get distracted.</p>

            <p>Generally speaking, I don&#39;t like songs with words; I find that often as not, the words kind of get in the way of the music. Pokemon music&#39;s usually pretty good. The boss battle for Bowser&#39;s Inside Story is freaking awesome, and Super Smash Brothers Brawl has pretty good remixes.<br><br>The few songs I like with words generally tend to be from the group Vocal Point. They do a cappela versions of whatever songs catch their fancy, and it&#39;s really cool.</p>

            <p>We don&#39;t necessarily have to stick to fandom or fanfiction on the Board; we talk about whatever seems interesting.<br><br>On that note, my favourite music... well, I have a lot of differing tastes, really. ABBA and Queen are among my favourite old groups, but I enjoy cheesy pop music, Disney Princesses songs, and musicals such as The Lion King, Wicked and assorted works by Andrew Lloyd Webber. :P<br><br>My absolute favourite musical artists, though, are Blind Guardian, a German power metal band whose biggest claim to fame is their Silmarillion concept album Nightfall in Middle-earth. <br> </p>

            <p>I was never into electronic or video game music.<br><br> I love Queen. Bohemian Rhapsody, for the win. Classic rock in general is great.<br><br> Metal is my other big genre. Together with classic rock, the two make up well over three quarters of my musical library.<br><br> The other eigth or so is mostly Celtic folk, marches, and crossovers between genres.</p>

Orken&#39;s backstory was interesting to read, but getting to see the characters from it is much more fun to read.<br><br>I like Jeannine, she is one of my favorite female PPC characters.

            <p>Hi!<br><br>My name&#39;s Frostbiter (not my real name, but it&#39;s what I go by on Fanfiction.net), and I&#39;m a fanfiction writer. I was disturbed by the unhealthy amount of badfic on there, but I wasn’t sure about what I should do about it. The poor grammar, inconsistent spelling, and obnoxious Sues nearly drove me insane (My eyes haven&#39;t been the same ever since I read &quot;My Immortal&quot;).<br><br>Then, I randomly stumbled across the Jay and Acacia PPC story the other day, and for the first time in a while, I laughed. In fact, I nearly died laughing while reading it. And when I finally finished it, I decided to go and join all of you.<br><br>I&#39;m still kind of new to Fanfiction and the PPC and everything, so what should I do now?<br></p>

I would also recommend reading the rest of Jay and Acacia&#39;s missions along with a lot of spin-offs to get to know the PPC canon. <br>If you want to make your first fanfic a goodfic, we have beta readers, who can help you out. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory</a></a><br>If you just want to hang out and be more or less silly, that is also welcommed. You don&#39;t have to write missions to be a PPC&#39;er; simply being a boarder makes you one. You can support the effort by reporting badfics that need to be sporked (if there is an existing badfic-thread on the frontpage, please use that rather than starting a new) and/or by helping others improve their missions and fanfics.<br><br>But for starters, just come on in and get to know us.</p>

            <p>Using one of my characters&#39; profiles, I apparently write like Isaac Asimov. Using a backstory I wrote to tie another of my characters into the world of an RP I frequent, I also write like Arthur Clarke. With several paragraphs of a fic I&#39;m writing for the drawer, I write like J.R.R. Tolkien. Finally, with a post I wrote for the aforementioned RP, I write like Cory Doctorow.<br><br>The first one was from several years ago, and the last one was deliberately written in a different style, but the other two are both pretty recent and written as normal.

            <p>It says that some of my missions scan like Shakespeare. I am not surprised, really; I favor short lines of dialog and action, peppered with some longer exposition here and there.

            <p>These fics used to be more popular a few years ago, I remember: especially in the Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, and Kingdom Hearts continuums. For some reason they have fallen slightly out of fashion and I don&#39;t see them too often anymore.<br><br>I originally was going to make my agents in Despatch but I could not find enough stories where the snatchers/hoppers were actually OK to just escort back home. If they&#39;re Mary Sues, then they&#39;re chargeable and assassinate-able.I could find a few stories like that, but just not enough to make a series of it.</p>

            <p>I think that anything involving &#39;Truth or Dare&#39; in a fanfic should be nuked on site, unless it&#39;s by an author who has written a lot of goodfic in the past.

            <p>As some of you may know, I recently attended a gaming and anime convention.  I also ran a couple of panels while I was there.  Well, people asked for transcripts, but I decided that videos are better.  So I filmed both of my panels and posted them on YouTube.  The first was titled &quot;Monks, Berserkers, and Assassins.  Oh My! (Or How to Create A Character)&quot;, the second was titled &quot;How to Break A Game and Why You Shouldn&#39;t&quot;.  Both were written for tabletop gamers, but the first is also useful for writers.  The second one is just fun.<br><br>You can find links to the videos on <a href="http://phoboslair.wordpress.com/">my blog.</a><br><br>Enjoy.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>The thing about Dummies is this: usually, they&#39;re used if the story is told from the POV of a Sue/Stu. That way, the author wraith possesses the Dummy and the agents are safe to do their work as usual.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how that would work if it was from the POV of a canon character who isn&#39;t replaced (according to you). It is perfectly possible for a wraith to possess an agent without a dummy, though: Aster wrote a mission sporking a fic that was in first person where the author wraith possessed the central character of the continuum the story was set in.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to make a judgment call, but I&#39;m not sure you need the Dummy in the first place. Dummies are only there to keep the agents from getting Sued by a Sue in a first person fanfic. If it&#39;s a different character altogether, then the wraith probably won&#39;t need a new body. I&#39;m not going to make a judgment call, but in your place that&#39;s what I&#39;d keep in mind.</p>

            <p>Really? Well, that simplifies things by a lot. The characters aren&#39;t replaced (although one of them gets really close--No, the canon character isn&#39;t gentle, sweet, or modest! She&#39;s jealous and possessive! But it doesn&#39;t last long enough for her to get replaced.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t used a Crash Dummy (yet), but I would think that if one is in use, the real character is stuffed in a plothole somewhere.  Every mission I&#39;ve seen with a Dummy, there&#39;s a Sue-wraith animating the thing.</p>

            <p>Hey! I suppose introductions are in order, I was hesitant to do this early on (I thought the site was dead at first but as of right now, you all seem very alive. Or atleast I assume you are. No offense.) I&#39;m Oxford, (named after the reference book series, being a bit of what I&#39;d like to call a &quot;relatio-bibliophile&quot; but my Latin might be a bit off, so lets just be blunt about it and say I have an odd obsession with dictionaries, thesauruses and encyclopedias) and I would like to request a spot as an agent in the Department of Mary Sues. Persona wise, I would describe myself as blunt, brutal and brusque in appearance but really a spineless, neurotic spaz in the face of improbable, stupid chance. I will be entering with my partner Wiki who will likely introduce herself in the near future and looking to enter the Department of Mary Sue Experiments and Research.<br><br>As far as links to stuff I&#39;ve written, my last two roleplay sites have been deleted but the latest (though it mught not be much) should have suitable writing. Anything written under the username Finn is mine: <a href="http://www.arcadianataxia.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=viewprofile&amp;user=admin"><a href="http://www.arcadianataxia.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=viewprofile&amp;user=admin">http://www.arcadianataxia.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=viewprofile&amp;amp;user=admin</a></a><br><br>Also, the two of us would like to take on... Heh. Even if its a sick, twisted suicide... Would like to take on the dreaded &quot;My Immortal&quot; as our first mission. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4719325/1/bMy_b_bImmortal_b_bREPOST_b"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4719325/1/bMy_b_bImmortal_b_bREPOST_b">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4719325/1/bMy_b_bImmortal_b_bREPOST_b</a></a> A repost since the original is no longer viewable but this contains all 45 Chapters of the bloodied thing... Sick as that is.<br><br>Well, that seems to be it! ^^ Thanks!</p>

            <p>Welcome, newcomer! Here, have various Bleep-products! And please, don&#39;t drink Sea Turtle&#39;s hydrophobic water. As fun as explosions of blood and organs are, recruits seem to be in short supply.<br><br> I&#39;m a local Brony. There are others, but they don&#39;t appear to have arrived yet. Nevertheless, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here!<br><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re so enthusiastic, but Turtle&#39;s right: you really should mess around a while. I still don&#39;t have permission, actually.<br><br> I&#39;m a fan of HP too, and fully understand why you&#39;d want to kill My Immortal. The canon just about curled up and died. It ruined a good song. And, quite frankly, the so-called lemons were really just sorry excuses written by a person who&#39;s probably never even seen pornography, let alone known how actual sex works. Or how love feels, no doubt. It&#39;s being speculated that the author is just a particularly cruel and clever Troll.<br><br> And this site will never die, my dear. So long as there is a Plot Continuum, there will be a PPC. Or at least until something like SOPA or ACTA passes. But then we&#39;ll have bigger things to worry about, such as the violent coup d&#39;état that will no doubt take place. Well, it will if my miniscule faith in humanity has even a little foundation.<br><br> Welcome once more, my dear! Enjoy your stay!</p>

            <p>Actually, Rainbow Dash is the only pony to break the sound barrier that we know of.<br><br> But yes. She survives things that would kill Wile E Coyote on a daily basis. She&#39;s been struck by lightning, smacked into trees at speeds that seemed only slightly less than sonic, as well as smacking into other ponies and falling off roofs, courtesy of our friend Derpy. Ponies in general are physically resilient- Pinkie Pie survived a bath in a dragon&#39;s fire- but Rainbow Dash especially.<br><br> I don&#39;t think you could get much faster without some serious aid from gods, demigods, or at least some incredibly powerful magic-users.<br><br> And it makes perfect sense. If Wiz and Boomstick have come to this conclusion... Well, I trust them. This is a huge victory for Bronies on the road to proving to everyone else that our fandom is awesome.</p>

            <p>Yeah, she pulls some pretty high Gs. Let&#39;s see, an F-18 Hornet fighter pilot at Mach 2.8 pulls 10 Gs on a turn. Dash flies at freaking Mach 10, which is around 3.57 times that. 10x3.57=35.7 Gs. In other words, on turns, Rainbow Dash gets to feel like she weighs about 35.7 times her actual body weight. This would probably not just suck the blood from a human&#39;s head to their feet- it would squish us like bugs.<br><br> So yeah, way stronger than anything known to man. She&#39;s tough even for a cartoon character- and I&#39;ve seen toons survive everything from nitroglycerin explosions right in their faces to falling about 40,000 feet. This pony is pulling the sort of stuff that would leave even Bugs Bunny or Wile E Coyote a pile of bloody mush and fur.<br><br> Now, for whatever reason, I see a bunch of pegasi taking off and flying to the tune of Iron Maiden&#39;s Aces High.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no way an F-18 can reach such a speed. In fact, a &quot;clean&quot; (no ordinance) F-18 can reach only Mach 1.8. With full ordinance load it is said to be barely supersonic at all.<br><br>In fact, there is actually only one fighter jet in the world to reach Mach 2.8, the Mig-31, and even it can only reach it at high alitude.

            <p>Oh, bollocks! I&#39;ve used the wrong numbers! I should know this stuff! I am really suppose to know this, and I don&#39;t! Now I feel ridiculous. And didn&#39;t Wiz and Boomstick say the F-22 Raptor was at Mach 2.8? Regardless, I know the F-18 pilots are still doing 10 Gs, because I was actually talking to one once and he said he would have weighted in at around 2000 pounds- ten times the normal weight of a guy like him. Therefore, 10 Gs. Regardless, the point Remains that Dash is sustaining some insane Gs up there.<br><br> Where the Heck would I talk to the pilot of a CF-18? you may ask. Well, the Canadian Cadet Movement has just as much magic as friendship. It&#39;s Heck to be taking care of my flight some nights, but it&#39;s all worth it in the end when I get to see them on parade at the end of the night.</p>

            <p>I am myself in airspace sector - currently doing a training course to become a final assembly worker in AgustaWestland.

(To the point that with enough hard work you can rise from &quot;assembly line&quot; to &quot;manager&quot;, since you already know nearly all about helicopter industry)<br><br>Wiz and Boomstick got the F-22 figure wrong - it gets &quot;only&quot; to Mach 2.25. Yet again, being America&#39;s new supremacy toy, the real speed could also be higher.<br><br>Dont feel bad about getting the numbers wrong - in an old story of mine I said that an F-14 was capable of doing Japan-France at Mach 2.8 continously. Not only the Tomcat gets only to 2.34, but it has also less than one third of that range. And not at maximum speed.<br><br>Such a travel would be possible only to an SR-71, with at least one air refueling.</p>

            <p>Well, I would suggest asking Wiz and Boomstick about it. These fellows are always open to suggestions. I believe you can speak to them at screwattack.com<br><br> They have a long history of being &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot; for fictional characters. They&#39;ve also matched up Samus Aran and Bobba Fett, as well as Harry Potter and Luke Skywalker and Kratos and Spawn. These guys are insane. They even settled Sonic vs Mario.

            <p>So we&#39;re done evaluating all the pages, and we even presented a nice fancy list of what we were doing with each Sue. Now some questions arise.<br><br>1. What are we going to do with actual deletion?<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=220653;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">Neshomeh had a good idea on that</a>, and I&#39;d like to see what the rest of the community thinks of that.<br><br>2. What are we going to do with the pages that need work?<br><br>That&#39;s an excellent question, to which I have no answer. Tawaki at least is still around; perhaps he should work on improving the ones of his that need work? Other than that, if a page we&#39;re keeping has no link, and we have a link, that should probably be added. Still, I don&#39;t really know what to do with the pages that need improvement whose creators are no longer active.<br><br>3. What are we going to do about adding pages in the future?<br><br>Obviously, the community needs to weigh in on this one. There are a few options; either strict, clear rules, some kind of deciding body, or perhaps a simple peer nomination process. I&#39;m sure there are more I&#39;m not thinking of, and I&#39;d love suggestions. A poll should probably be created to vote on this issue. </p>

            <p>... Obviously I like my own suggestion for the deletion process. &gt;.&gt; I&#39;m also still willing to take a hand in re-writing. I&#39;ll volunteer specifically for the Balrog Sue (I can take care of renaming the article at the same time), and also Alumia and Sairalinde, unless there are objections.<br><br>For adding pages in the future, I like the idea of peer nomination and/or a committee, but I&#39;d also suggest a built-in delay. For instance, if people (not including the mission&#39;s author(s), for obvious reasons) are still talking about a particular Sue X months later, that suggests it was outstanding enough to have some impact and stick in people&#39;s minds beyond the end of the mission. It might also go some length to deterring gimmicks for gimmicks&#39; sake just to get a page, since no gimmicky thing will guarantee that people are impacted enough to talk about it after a period of time. If nobody&#39;s talking, then perhaps that Sue wasn&#39;t such a big deal after all, and it won&#39;t hurt PPC posterity to not take up wiki space with it.<br><br>For a period of delay, my immediate thought is at least two months. That&#39;s more than enough to knock links off the Board and the wiki front page, providing for a test of group memory rather than group ability to spot links.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, let&#39;s go with this.<br><br>1. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised someone hasn&#39;t started doing that already, so yeah.<br><br>2. Hm... Well, you got me there. I&#39;m not sure myself, so...<br><br>3. Adding pages in the future... Well, this is of special interest since I already mentioned the Subject 23 page to you and EileenAlphabet. So... I say we get a small group of people who can decide by votes what is or isn&#39;t speshul. Maybe even set up a kind of thing where if someone forwards an e-mail to this panel, we can vote on whether or not we think this Stu/Sue is speshul or not. But I&#39;m open to other ideas.</p>

            <p>I suppose it says something that the best library in my city has a Wii and there are actually children standing around in a line waiting to use it and complaining they&#39;re bored right in front of a large and shiny display of the latest and greatest books in children&#39;s literature...<br><br>I hope that libraries don&#39;t die in the same way I hope Barnes &amp; Noble doesn&#39;t die.

            <p>Which, sadly, most people aren&#39;t well aware of, and for the worse.<br><br>Libraries are important cornerstones in our society- and this recession has been utterly terrible for something that is so important. That comment defending libraries is one of many, thankfully, against a growing attempt- that is often successful in many areas- to defund public libraries, or cut where they can. What this means, overall, is less help for people who need it, and lowered standards.<br><br>There are many libraries out there now that have skeleton staffs where they can barely help the public for the lack of people, or they&#39;re staffed by people who are purposefully picked up because they don&#39;t have the training so they don&#39;t have to be paid well or given full time hours, or they can&#39;t replace the books and equipment they have. Libraries all across the US- and in other countries as well- are experiencing this woe.<br><br>That article&#39;s hypothetical person does exist. Libraries are often the first line of defense for people who need help that they can&#39;t otherwise get; supplementary education, access to a place to get those important forms filled out and help with doing them, access to improving their lives, overall.<br><br>Public libraries are one of the equalizers of the world, because they represent free knowledge, and the guaranteed access to that knowledge. <br><br><br></p>

Teana, an ex-TSAB agent gone freelancer, mucks with the plot of quite a number of &#39;verses in her travels. In this one, she brings the UNSC and the Elites with her to the Koprulu Sector and assists James Raynor in his crusade against Arcturus Mengsk. She immediately defuses a major plot point in the form of having Tychus Findlay free of Mengsk&#39;s control (despite him having been released from prison and sealed into his CMC by Mengsk&#39;s personal orders), has a human without Protoss physique or psionic powers join the Dark Templar, gives humans Protoss teleportation tech, and copy-pastes herself into canon cutscenes. Oh, and she messes with the prophetic vison of the Zerg Overmind by having the entire multiverse destroyed by the hybrids. The might of the enslaved Zerg Swarm is considerable, but is probably not enough to quash the combined military force of all &#39;verses in existence. I mean, a tiny fraction of the United Earth Directorate almost managed to crush the Swarm during the Brood War. <br><br>The entire story is as dry as tinder, with no characterization and no suspense. Heck, I can get more enjoyment watching a commentary-less replay of the single player campaign.</p>

            <p>Technically, their armour would stand up quite nicely to the ME verse&#39;s weaponry. If we look at each side&#39;s weaponry, they both fire projectiles at hypersonic velocities but the StarCraft C-14 Impaler has a 200+ round magazine filled with either 8mm steel spikes, depleted U-238 slugs or .50 Cal ammo. It fires 30 rounds/sec and can be plugged into the CMC for computer-assisted aiming and more recoil suppression. In game, the Marine can be mauled by the Zerg, shot and hacked at with energy weapons, sprayed with acid and still run around very much alive (although that can be gameplay and story segregation right there). Fluff says that a CMC armoursuit is mostly impervious to small arms fire and that needleguns (aka the C-14) are one of the few things that Terrans have that can dent it. <br><br>Meanwhile, ME weapons have lower mag capacities and fire projectiles the size of sand particles. They do look cooler though. Waaaay cooler.<br><br>With regards to CDHammer&#39;s post, the Achilles heel of the Terran Marine is its rather pathetic DPS. Despite being visually imposing, it is the weakest tier one unit of the three races and is ineffective unless you mass them like crazy. And research Stim. And Combat Shields. And 3/3 weapons and armour. It really puts the entire power scale of this universe into perspective once that you understand that this walking tank is actually a very weak unit.<br><br>Being shot in this visor is fatal, as demonstrated in this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6squ47FqK8k"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6squ47FqK8k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6squ47FqK8k</a></a><br><br>StarCraft Terrans have no need for Mass Effect fields as they can generate artificial gravity and achieve FTL travel without them. Psionics replace Biotics in this universe, and the Protoss wield psionic energies to a frightening degree of efficiency: they can devastate mechs and living things alike by casting psionic storms on an area.<br><br>/explanations and justifications of the power scale<br></p>

            <p>As if the title isn&#39;t enough to chortle at to begin with.<br><br>A brief examination of the fic confirms everything: formatting&#39;s out of whack, constant run-on sentences (GAAARGH!), crossover method I am still at a loss to explain and, of course, the balance of power in combat.<br><br>Good grief! OK, it&#39;s a given that Starcraft has a few balls in their court (such as their battleship-mounted Yamato cannons). But surely even the Terrans of Starcraft have their own Achilles heel? For example, their infantry have head-sized, UV and photo-sensitive visors, so surely a merc with an M-8 assault rifle should be able to punch through that. Instant severe, if not fatal, casualty. <br><br>Not to mention the fundamental, defining aspect of the M.E. universe: the creation and generation of mass effect fields. If there was a way for the Citadel space races to even the score should conflict between the two factions break out, this would be it. Why? Because Terran scientists seem to have not even touched on this area of cosmic science.<br><br>Modified mass effect fields in small arms could allow for better penetration of armour. Utilising biotics on a larger scale could be a major boon as well - even Terrans cannot stop being torn apart atom by atom by a singularity. And so on and so forth.<br><br>OK, I think this rant of mine against this badfic is done. Sorry for wasting the community&#39;s time.</p>

            <p>I will team up with someone on Teana&#39;s Travels. Teana would never quit the TSAB, it goes against her whole character, since her motivation for joining the TSAB was to restore her brother&#39;s honor, since he died in combat, and she wants to prove the techniques he taught her weren&#39;t useful, and that someone who didn&#39;t have a rare skill, or who wasn&#39;t absurdly powerful, could keep up with those who DID.</p>

            <p>A while ago, Sequitur (the ultimate non-Gibbs NCIS fan fiction writer) published (or whatever the verb is) this:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7521557/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7521557/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7521557/1/</a></a><br>It&#39;s an interesting idea about what might have happened when Gibbs went off to Mexico. In it, Director Shepard keeps assigning different people as team leaders, and McGee and Ziva keep scaring them off; McGee goes ultra-geek and Ziva starts taking all her foreign-ninja weirdnesses to the extreme. The &quot;reverse the polarity&quot; bit in the pilot chatfic reminded me of it. <br><br>Enjoy. Also, does anyone have a good SG•1 fanfic rec?</p>

            <p>I like this fic: <a href="http://rydra-wong.dreamwidth.org/79396.html"><a href="http://rydra-wong.dreamwidth.org/79396.html">http://rydra-wong.dreamwidth.org/79396.html</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s the only non-crossover AU I can really say I think is excellent, and least as far as Stargate goes. The premise is really interesting. The first chapter&#39;s really weird, and it does require some familiarity with two season six episodes, but for all that, it&#39;s really well written, and you can probably get by without knowing about them.</p>
