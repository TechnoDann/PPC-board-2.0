            <p>I have a friend who is trying to get my help to stop writing Sues and Stues. She is asking me- not the other way around- and so I feel kinda obligated to help her.<br><br>The problem? All of her characters- good, bad, and indifferent- are raging Sues. When she adds character flaws, they become anti-sues or villain sues. They all warp reality so that everything they do works out for the best... and my characters try not to help with this, but she still needs a lot of help. <br><br>Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I have a slightly similar problem... A friend of mine writes pretty bad self-inserts...<br>For example, his main character is a version of himself who&#39;s the lovechild of fem!Prussia and someone-or-other (I forget) who is mistaken for Russia by Belarus and then killed by her when she discovered he wasn&#39;t Russia. ._.<br>I&#39;m not sure of the best way to let him know... maybe I should link him the page on the Wiki that explains about Mary Sues, Gary Stus and Airy Oohs. Hmm...<br><br>But back on the main topic... I&#39;m not sure. Maybe you could sit with her and write a short story and point out where she&#39;s going wrong as she writes it?<br>I&#39;m not sure whther that&#39;s good advice or a complete load of caffeine-fueled twaddle.</p>

            <p>Yeah... it&#39;s getting kind of bad... Except somehow he&#39;s mistaken for Russia despite having different hair. He explains it with something along the lines of &#39;Belarus would just assume he&#39;d changed his hair to hide from something&#39; but... some serious amounts of &quot;WAT.&quot; going on there.<br><br>And I understand your point with them and humans (I think of Percy Jackson and the Gods&#39; many kids with humans) but it was the child of Prussia and another country... I just can&#39;t remember who... It might have been Russia. Yeah, I think it was Russia. Because he&#39;s a Russia and Prussia fanboy. But he doesn&#39;t like yaoi (to the point where he <i>threw up</i> after reading a EnglandWales RP I had). It makes no sense!</p>

            <p>in my opinion is for the author to always remember that the world, whether it be original or a canon, does not revolve around the character. She doesn&#39;t have to be speshul, but if everyone acts like they would have no motivation to do anything if she wasn&#39;t there, the character is a sue all the same.<br>That&#39;s just the mindset I try to put myself in when trying not to write mary sues. It&#39;s a great place to start, and If you can keep it in mind while writing, sues are less likely to show up.<br>At least for me.</p>

            <p>Are you able to share an example of her work?<br><br>I think I recall reading something, either in one of the historic posts here or on the wiki, where someone had given 2 descriptions of the same character; one &#39;normal&#39; and one Sued. If I can find it, I&#39;ll put the link up, it might be useful as a &#39;desueifying&#39; template. <br><br>Other than that, most of the pages on the wiki relating to Sues and the writing guide might be a good place to start. </p>

            <p>Problem is, she knows most of the common Sue traits and has been trying to get rid of them... she just... they&#39;re still Sues. I dunno HOW you make a six-year-old blind girl a Mary Sue, but she did it.<br><br>------<br>Le Sample:<br><br>She took her knife, sliced a cut in her leg and one on her arm. It would make the act more believable but she winched in pain. Tears slid down her cheeks as she remembered what she desired to fight for. A scream parted her lips. Birds flew up from the tree branches as her voice echoed through the night. The soldier&#39;s on their horses stopped. Sabrina flew down the mountain side, well actually chose to roll down the hill. Dirt, grime and leaves stuck in her hair, and became a mass of tangles. The pain in her leg and arm stung but she cried out as she tumbled down. When she had come to a complete stop she laid face up, tears streamed down her face. Her fingertips dug into the sand. The soldier&#39;s dismounted and stared down upon her. “Please... it... it took my son...” <br> Two of the men exchanged glances at each other. The red head bent down and helped her up. She duested the dirt off and continued to sob. <br>   “It?” The red head spoke softly. His bright green hues locked onto hers. <br>   “A... a chupacabra... it took my son. I tried to fight if off but it overwhelmed me, threw me down a mountain side...” Sabrina was a good actress. She showed the men her wounds and sobbed hysterically. <br>  The one that stood next to the red head frowned. “Nasty creatures. They mainly dwell in the desert lands like this one. They also stay off the lantern path and feed off of animals and other small prey. I have rarely heard of one go after a small child unless it was desperately hungry.” <br> Sabrina gulped. She looked at the red head, a young boy. She took in his ruffled appearance, he was about her height, well groomed and muscle. Rope after rope lined his stomach. She smelt a faint  odor of tobacco on the man though. His gaze held her captive. For a minute, Sabrina almost choked but she held her ground steady and continued to let the tears flow. <br> “What were you doing off the lantern path mi lady?” The older gentleman asked. <br> “I...my.... my son and I got lost!” She sobbed. “I got lost, please that monster is going to eat my son!” The older gentlemen turned to the younger one and pulled him back a ways as one of the others wrapped cloth around her wounds. She read their lips as they spoke quietly. <br>    “We shouldn&#39;t trust her.” The older one told the red head. “She could be a raider, lost in the woods with the lantern path this close? I don&#39;t believe it.” <br>    The older gentleman scoffed. “Vortigren, silence your tongue. She&#39;s in hysteria can&#39;t you tell?” He told him. “Don&#39;t you know your manners? We should always aid those in need. The king&#39;s mission can wait.” <br>  The man scowled. His voice turned cold, Sabrina could tell by how he mouthed his words. “It could be a bloody trap and you are going to lead us right into it?” He seemed to command. The younger boy sighed. <br>  “Is this my mission or is this not my mission?” He retorted. “I say we go. If we find out she is lying, we will take her to the king, we are heading North East, we have to catch our targets before they catch the bridge any ways.” <br>  “I do not like this plan.” Vortigren hissed, Sabrina waited patiently, and let little gasps escape her lips. She flinched as the soldier stitched the knife cut on her leg and wrapped it gently. <br>  “There you are miss.” He said politely. <br>    “Thank you... please I just want my son back...” She sobbed, the younger man nodded as she gazed back up at the two men. The red head approached her. He was serious. He stood erect, his hands in his pockets as he pulled out his tobacco pipe and lit it. There was a spark of flame and he exhaled a cloud of smoke. One of the soldier&#39;s groaned as his smoke trail lingered in the air and took off in a singular direction. Sabrina had never seen anything like it as the boy&#39;s eye&#39;s narrowed. <br>    “I know witch direction your son has been taken.” The man replied. “We will find him. Come on, you can ride my horse. I will walk.” She nodded. She had been intrigued that his pipe could track any one down. She would make sure her men would strike before they reached Central Leurex . She wouldn&#39;t let them know anything but how they would wake up in the morrow with binds and gags. </p>

            <p>Well, this character doesn&#39;t seem flat out Sue, but is on the edge.<br>She&#39;s just met these men, and after hearing their names ONCE she can remember them perfectly. Also, she just flung herself off a mountain. I think a real person would have a few more conflicting feelings about throwing themselves off a mountain. I don&#39;t see any mention of what Sabrina is feeling, which makes her seem like she isn&#39;t feeling anything at all. This gives off the feeling that she&#39;s always calm in the face of danger, which can be a Sue trait.<br><br>The soldier who is showing suspicion of Sabrina is quickly shushed, and is told that he&#39;s being unsympathetic. While he is, he is also using logic. But instead of taking his words into account, the other soldier stays kind and even offers to let Sabrina use his horse. While this might be realistic in this situation, he doesn&#39;t seem to be at all suspicious of her.<br><br>The soldiers are also giving the reader a healthy dose of exposition on what they&#39;re doing and what a chupacabra is. The way they&#39;re talking doesn&#39;t seem natural because of this.<br><br>The main problem though, is that we don&#39;t linger on her feelings. Is she feeling guilty about tricking these nice soldiers? Is she scared that she&#39;s going to get discovered?</p>

            <p>Since at least two different people have talked about starting up a game of Fill the Plotholes (and have apparently been struck down from setting up said game by mysterious outside forces) I am being superstitious and not starting up a game of Fill the Plotholes.<br><br>Instead, I am trying to do up a new and different game!<br><br>Write the Genre!<br><br>It is simple.<br><br>We&#39;re going to do a cowrite mission, except it&#39;ll be on the board, and written portion by portion using a single pair of agents. <br><br>The spin for this game is that each written portion will be written as though in a different genre or particularly unique author&#39;s style (as determined by the previous writer). Some examples: Noir, high fantasy; Hunter S. Thompson, Terry Pratchett<br><br><b>Rules</b><br><br>To help this not dissolve into a giant singular fest of festiveness and confusion, here are a few rules:<br><br>1. Due to the fact that writing things does take some time, you may claim and tag the next portion. However, you will only have <b>one hour</b> to post it in. This hour goes by the time on the board. So if your post for claiming the next portion is at 7:43 PM, you have until 8:43 PM to post before your claim expires. You can also not claim jump or queue up in hopes of someone failing. You have to wait until their claim expires before you can post a claim.<br><br>2. So people don&#39;t get carried away and finish the mission on their own in a single style or most of it, the maximum amount of words per portion- including excerpts from the fic- is 1000 words. Try to make your turn also have around 500 words, so it&#39;s not a waste of a genre.<br><br>3. No back-and-forths!  Share the game! Every turn should not be alternating between you and your buddy, or you taking a turn every other one. After you have a turn, you can&#39;t go until two other people have written. <br><br>4. The only prohibited genre is erotica.

            <p>The two agents immediately collapsed onto the floor the moment they were in their response center.<br><br>&quot;That was terrible!&quot; <br><br>&quot;I need to scrub my mouth out with something,&quot; Cris groaned. &quot;The grammar, the terrible grammar...&quot;<br><br>&quot;You weren&#39;t the one crying tears of <i>blood</i>!&quot; Myall wailed.

What the frak happened?&quot;<br><br>A polite cough coming from near the console caught their attention. Techno-Dann was screwing the side panel back on. <br><br>Cris immediately shoved herself off the floor. &quot;What are you doing to our console?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Fixing it,&quot; said the technician. &quot;The readings from your console were going through the roof.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Myall stared at the console. She got up, on uneasy legs. &quot;I fixed that!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yeah, after I unplugged the toaster.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was wondering about that,&quot; Dann said. &quot;The Department of Dead Author Electricity Generation experienced a voltage spike just before your console recieved the mission call. Normally, the TVSS would catch it, but it looks like the console&#39;s surge protector was already experiencing some problems because its VDR had been abused to the point of failure. Beyond that, for whatever reason the thyristors in there were looping in on themselves, so the genre and style regulator board failed. I just managed to lock it to &#39;PPC&#39;, but we can&#39;t afford the downtime required to replace the components that need it, so don&#39;t agitate it.&quot;<br><br>Cris blinked. &quot;Uh. Can you repeat that in simple English?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your console went boom because you were melting spoons in a toaster.

It was a nightmare trying to find everything in there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Awwwwww.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now that that&#39;s sorted out, I&#39;m heading back to DoSAT; Makes-Things is probably waiting for my report.&quot; With that, Dann left.<br><br>The two agents looked at each other.<br><br>&quot;This was your fault.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean, it was my fault, he just said-&quot;<br><br>&quot;-That it was your fault!&quot;<br><br>RC E# descended into bickering.</p>

But their quarry was still unaware of their presence; they were not such poor trackers as to blunder around and alert her.<br><br><i>I almost wish that we could kill her now,</i> Cris thought with a sudden savagery, coupled with an urge to leave the fic and get back to the burritos waiting for her in the response center. She said as much to Myall, who gave her a sidewise glance.<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“Look, it’d be perfect. There’s so much noise…nobody would be paying attention to us. Nobody would be paying attention to her, either, if she just got up and left and never came back…”<br><br>“Cris.” Myall’s voice brought her back down to earth. “We have to charge her first. Remember?”<br><br>“Right,” Cris said, frowning slightly. She bit her lip and tried to turn her attention back to the Quidditch game, which was – thankfully – largely unaltered by the Sue’s meddling with the canon. It was an entertaining enough match, even if she knew how it was going to end, but sometimes it was nice to be able to just sit back and enjoy it. Myall seemed to be having a good time, too, or at least as good a time as a PPC Agent on assignment was allowed to have.<br><br>So they huddled in the alcove, sneaking glances at the match, until it ended congruently to canon. The spectators began to trickle out of the stadium once the match was over and all of the excitement had subsided to a dull hum, and Myall nodded at Cris as he got up. The pair of agents insinuated themselves into the crowd near the Weasleys and Aliena – not so close as to be noticed by the Sue, but not so far away that they would lose track of her. They had an advantage in that they knew what the Weasleys’ tents looked like, a useful bit of intel that thankfully had only needed to be scouted out with a reliance on the canon, but they would still rather not have lost her. It was a matter of pride more than anything.<br><br>As they all returned to their tents, Cris and Myall hung back in the nearby woods, keeping an eye on the target’s encampment. There was another sizable amount of time before the Sue would emerge from the tent and make herself a target for assassination; the agents figured that it would be best served by resting. Myall sat down and leaned his back against a tree, closing his eyes while Cris took watch. Night soon fell.<br><br>She examined the Words in the meantime and growled out an expletive as the Weasleys argued about ‘clobbing’. “It’s <i>cobbing</i>,” she snarled to nobody in particular, since Myall had fallen into a light doze. “Clobbing…that sounds like something involving terrible guns in GoldenEye…” She continued to make angry noises at the typos she saw until—<br><br>—sparks split the night. That jolted her into wakefulness; she must have fallen into a light doze, and she cursed herself for being careless. She shook Myall’s shoulder to wake him up, and his eyes snapped open.<br><br>“Death Eaters,” she said. “The Sue will be out soon, doubtless to do something heroic.” As if on cue, the tent flap was thrown dramatically open, the Sue framed by the dim light from inside. Bill had been with her – he quickly withdrew as the screams of terror began.<br><br>The target was now alone.<br><br>Cris grinned like something feral. “Come on,” she said to Myall. “Let’s do this thing.”<br><br>They approached the Sue as the chaos began in earnest.<br><br><b>(And for the coup de grace, I leave you with the genre - or rather, the author - Tara Gilesbie.

            <p>Feeling as they did the weight of The Duty, the Agents bowed to its demands, proceeding to follow the Sue’s entourage of Weasleys to, with a ray of canon shining through, the seats acquired by Mr. Weasley. The crush of witches and wizards, most decked in their cheeriest robes of support, for their favoured team, served to conceal Cris and her partner well. It also provided the most perfect opportunity for observation, and she stole a glance at her compatriot, who had, in the interim, undergone as puzzling a transformation of gender as she herself had not so long ago. It seemed to her, however, to be indelicate to enquire further.<br><br>Thankfully the majesty of the stadium was little dimmed or twisted by the Sue. However, that pleasant peace was not to last--Mr. Bromia swiftly place a restraining arm around her shoulders, even as Cris fought to keep down an expression of fury entirely unbecoming of a gentlewoman. ‘And she dares to call that <em>Elvish</em>?’<br><br>‘Elfish, more like,’ her partner corrected. ‘At least, so I would assume, from the notes given at the outset of this travesty.’<br><br>His words prompted her to check their progress. Small blessing though it was, they had at last arrived at the final instalment. Saying as much to Mr. Bromia, she noted the look of unvarnished, yet oddly cheerful, vicious pleasure at the reminder, for it meant that shortly they could administer justice. The realization itself served to remind them that they had not yet discussed an appropriate method, with which to dispose of the Sue. He began to discuss it--arguing that, with the discussion between Mr. Potter and the house elf Winky proceeding unchecked, the time was ripe to plan.<br><br>Cris, however, overrode him--not to put off the discussion, but by her continuing observations of the abuse of Canon, the first of which noting, in a surprising turn of events, that young Harry briefly held the author’s attention. The rare pleasure was soon abandoned, however, in favour of absolute drivel.<br><br>‘This cannot be serious!’ she burst out. ‘I will leave that she needs to <em>guess</em> she--the great beauty who has replaced a Veela herself in Mr. William’s affections--is different from the diminutive Winky, without remark--’<br><br>‘Were it not improper, I would note that you have indeed remarked upon it,’ her partner murmured.<br><br>‘--but this theory of the evolution of the house elves seems utterly preposterous!’ Even for the universe of Ms. Rowling’s construction, which was at time nearly as nonsensical, as the Suefics themselves could be, such a history seemed beyond the pale. Whether for good or for ill, the author--all too predictably--neglected to explore this with further depth, and the connection between the canonical elves and the superfluous Sue creations, though briefly described as male, passed quietly as the conversation at last turned to the events at hand.<br><br>The next half-hour passed in merciful uneventfulness. The respite allowed the Agents to at last discuss their plans for the creature purporting to be a Miss Aliena Everlight of elfish descent, and her painful and imminent demise. Their attention was unavoidably recaptured, with the arrival of the Malfoy family.<br><br>At the misuse of ‘there’ in place of ‘their,’ Mr. Bromia muttered with disappointment. He found it a pity indeed that the instance did not yield any interesting--much less entertaining--side effects. ‘However, one could argue that to be the greatest charge of all. There is nothing <em>interesting</em> left. And,’ he added after a moment’s thought, ‘that there is no easily accessible source of burritos.’<br><br>‘You might have eaten a little in the Weasley kitchen,’ Miss Wirewood reminded him.<br><br>‘And abused Mrs. Weasley’s unknowing hospitality? Hardly!’ he protested. ‘Besides, I am not certain I could trust myself to know which might have been... <em>altered</em>, shall we says, by Messurs Frederick and George?’<br><br>Though about to agree with the sentiment, a piece of the narration became unexpectedly distracting. ‘‘Suddenly?’’ Cris exclaimed with incredulity. ‘Surely the enmity with the Malfoys would come as no surprise to one claiming to be romantically attached to the eldest of the Weasley children!’ As she said it, the scene shifted into a sequence almost directly mirroring those of the books, and both Agents sighed with released tension.<br><br>Mr. Bromia observed that, for all the suffering employment with the PPC necessarily entailed, nonetheless it occasioned its own relief--rare as such times might be--for how many could claim witness to such an historic competition as that between Bulgaria and Ireland, during the years of the second great Wizarding War?<br><br>Cris glanced through the words briefly. ‘And the Sue deigns to spare us from further truly horrifying transgressions, for the duration of the event,’ she agreed with satisfaction. ‘I believe we may amuse ourselves with impunity.’<br><br>With such exchanges of delight, the pair located a small opening from which to observe events unfolding. Though--the great numbers of spectators having taken all the seats--they could only squeeze into close standing quarters, they hardly noticed either the discomfort or the impropriety of their situation. The Sue dismissed with almost casual insignificance the grandeur of the pageants and the excitement of the game--yet as such, only her most unimportant opinions and slight actions marred Canon’s natural beauty. For those hours of the game, Miss Wirewood was free to revel in the rush of the moment, and the heady emotions of the crowd, for once afforded a nearly-unscarred happiness, which came so rarely in the endless battle against the Sues.<br><br><br><br>[As we finally near the conclusion to the pain we have endured, the author now humbly offers up the prompt of <b>spy thriller</b>.]</p>

            <p>The Sue&#39;s eating. Juicy sausage and golden eggs... it smells so good and my stomach&#39;s growling. I wonder if I could steal some of them. No, Cris would kill me. Better not. Then again, Cris would kill me for a lot of things. Like killing the Sue RIGHT now, without charging her. Oh, gosh, that would be so worth it. Dumb little pointy-eared bint thinks she&#39;s an elf, let&#39;s show her real elf arrows, shall we? I got these off a LOTR Sue, Mordwenna or Mackenna, something like that. They&#39;re Sue Arrows, meaning they&#39;ve got peacock arrows for fletching and they&#39;re always sharp, and frak, I can just IMAGINE little pointy-eared bint with two or three of these sticking out of her, that would be so worth it-<br>Sue&#39;s got my attention again. She&#39;s wearing BURGUNDY with a GREEN rosette. How tacky can you get? Even in my home continuum, no one would have put up with that sort of poor fashion choice, and my home continuum is Star Wars, for pete&#39;s sake, everyone had terrible bowl haircuts. Though Han Solo managed to pull it off. He was a cool guy. I wish I could have gotten to know him. Ah, well, no mucking about with the Plot Continuum...<br> I never did get to ride in the Falcon. Maybe someday there&#39;ll be a Han-luster who&#39;ll write a fic on the Falcon. Then I can go there. Though I&#39;m getting really sick of Sues... when all this is over, I&#39;m going to ask for a transfer. Implausible Crossovers would be nice, there&#39;d be less Sues... or Bad Slash, maybe... no... I couldn&#39;t handle the smut, it&#39;d give me hives. I never did like it, anyway. Or maybe Floaters. I dunno. Sues are getting kind of monotonous, they&#39;re all the same. At least you don&#39;t get too many Darth Bane Sues, most Suethors don&#39;t even know who he is. <br>Uh-oh, Sue&#39;s a-moving. Time to go.<br></p>

            <p>Fanfiction.<br><br>A constrained environment, defined by its usage and adherence to a previously created work of fiction&#39;s characters, settings, and themes. For many burgeoning young writers, this is where they begin, continuing a legacy of storywriting that has existed since we first began telling stories.<br><br>In some cases, unfortunately, in their attempts to write a story these new writers stumble into serious mistakes, ones that can cause terrible harm to the fabric of the original canon, through poor adapatation of the characters, destruction of the setting, and ignorance of the themes involved. <br><br>In this environment, of course, we find a rich ecosystem develops, with more experienced writers finding the works of the inexperienced poor, and leaving much to be wanted. These new writers also often introduce a new, invasive species into the world; Mary Sues.<br><br>Mary Sues are often unwanted things, an exotic pet set loose in the wrong environment; often dangerous on their own, they can lead to changing the story around them for the worse, for these creatures have no natural predators. <br><br>Due to this, groups of Mary Sue &quot;hunters&quot; developed. <br><br>Much like the ranger protects nature from negative influences that can lead to the destruction of those precious natural resources and to maintain an area&#39;s natural population, thus do members of the Canon Protective Initiative work. <br><br>Here we can see two at work; these two are constables- agents- of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, entrusted with, in their case, culling Mary Sues from where they do not belong.<br><br>In this particular work of fiction, a particularly obtrusive Mary Sue has been located. She is an elf of the variety one often sees in high fantasy, as inspired by Tolkien&#39;s seminal work <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<br><br>Unfortunately, she is in a fanfiction that is set in the world of Harry Potter, where elves are house elves, minor servants who bind themselves to a master and work for free. <br><br>Here, she has entered a relationship with Bill Weasley, and the story is on the cusp of the Quidditch World Cup that marks the opening chapters of <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>. Indeed, the fanfiction has heavily borrowed from the canon, with only a few lines differing to include the Sue.<br><br>Finally, however, we see the slightest of divergences, as Aliena- as the Sue is named- and Bill are not joining Harry Potter and the others to travel by Porkey.<br><br>The constables, Myall Bromia and Cris Wirewood, are under an unsual amount of stress on their mission today, for though the Sue is a quite simple one, as far as Sues go- all members of this particular organization are required to maintain a list of wrongs done by the Sue to determine how detrimental to canon she is- there is something awry with their equipment. <br><br>In a situation where being able to react to the narrative and use it to their advantage is frequently the difference between a successful culling or perilous injury to themselves, they are at a disadvantage. <br><br>It is not preventing them from carrying out their duty, however, as they await under the Weasley family kitchen table, observing the Sue. <br><br>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Cris whispers.<br><br>&quot;Hear what?&quot; Myall asks, as she looks around.<br><br>&quot;The narration! There is <i>definitely</i> something wrong. It sounds like David Attenborough!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yeah, it does, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Also, now you&#39;re a guy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was hoping we could ignore that.&quot;<br><br>Finally, the Sue and her canon companion rise from the table, to put on their robes, as Percy Weasley returns from preparing himself for the day. <br><br><i>Charlie&#39;s robes were deep forest green, probably to offset all the bright green Ireland colors he would be collecting once they got there. Percy&#39;s robes were dark blue, and Bill&#39;s were a shade above jet black. Aryen&#39;s own robes were a rich burgundy color.</i><br><br>Soon after a final motherly order from Mrs Weasley, Percy, Bill, and the Sue depart for their destination through apparation, leaving our agents behind.<br><br><br>[Your next genre: Stream of consciousness!]</p>

            <p>Set to the rail tracks of the original Harry Potter texts, the pawns of the anomaly girl spoke the strings of dialogue that had been set for them by their benevolent creator.<br><br>The head woman of the family began to raise her voice as she “interrogated” her son, Bill, over his choice of attire. As she did this, the two diligent agents dedicated to protection the canon, felt a small shift in the way time progressed.<br><br>“Oh my!” Chris exclaims. “A single word that was placed into this fanatical fiction has changed the tenses that are being used to describe the events that are taking place! My own actions have been infected by this vile mistake!”<br><br>Just as these words left the plot protector’s lips, the tenses of the words in the piece of atrocious fiction fixed themselves.<br><br>“Ah!” uttered Myall. “The word that is at fault in this, is ‘maintains’. The proper word is ‘maintained’, and due to this offence to the delicate structure of word tenses, I shall mark it as such on the register of crimes this reality-warping woman has committed.”<br><br>The exchange of dialogue between Mrs. Weasly and her son continued. It was an almost perfect duplicate of the exchange that happened in the original work of fiction, Harry Potter. The only deviation from the original exchange was that the mother of Bill stated to the monstrous Aliena that she desired for Aliena to convince her son to let her trim his hair.<br><br>Myalls facial features shifted into a frown. “Really, I question why this abomination to the construction of decent characters could sway Bill Weasly’s opinion more than his mother could.”<br><br>The events continued, and again as in the original book, other attendees at the table started to converse about the bizarre magical sport known as ‘Qudditch’. However, this exchange was more altered than the previous one, as the monstrous Aliena stole words from a character’s mouth, and spoke them.<br><br>The protagonist after which the tomes of fiction were named inquired what happened. Another Weasly child who was called Charlie, as well as the reality-warping Aliena, relayed the events that had occurred during a previous match of Quidditch.<br><br>According to the universal script of the fictitious work of writing, Aliena enjoyed the look on Harry’s face when she revealed to him that she took part in the sport of Quidditch. “ Yes ,Harry, elves enjoy a good round of Quidditch ever now and then.” the monster told the boy.<br><br>“This can not be!” Chris exclaimed, outraged at this statement that went against the very fabric of the Harry Potter universe. “Not only is there a misspelling, which is a minor thing considering what else was in that atrocious statement, but elves do not play Quidditch! And even if elves inhabited the world of Harry Potter, why would the boy assume that they did not play Quidditch?!” The agent took out his heat retaining liquid container, turned the nob on the lid that opened a small slide, and took a sip of mind-cleansing herbal concoction that prevented him from recalling foolishness.<br><br>“Blea?” Chris offered his trusted partner.<br><br>“Please.” Myall took the container from him, and took a long sip. She had a strong suspicion that this was going to be quite a long assignment.</p>

            <p>When I came to, groggy and my sight blurry, I felt a sort of schizoid separation from my own body, as if I was an intruder, a mere guest, inhabiting it against some higher Will. I tried to move my limbs, but they did not obey my commands; I tried to move my mouth to express my distress, but no sounds came out. Soon I did speak, but the voice was booming and somehow alien, coming from a source that was not quite inside me.<br><br>&quot;Well, I guess that means we better start setting up the tables”, the voice said, the voice of Bill-Weasley-who-was-not. I recoiled, even though the movement was impossible, my presence frozen within my own flesh and blood. The eyes-that-were-not-mine turned, and I saw something that made my heart-that-was-not-my-heart seize, and I was mortified as I had no clear idea whether this was because I was so terrified of the creature before me, or if the Bill-Weasley-who-was-not was so deeply amoured by it, the creature twisting the not-me to its command.<br><br>The creature was squeamous, dangly, in the rough shape of a human, with long messy hair and ears that seemed to elongate at the tips, turning into sharp edges like butcher’s knives. She grinned at the me-who-was-not, with her teeth bared, yellow grimy fangs that looked poised to tear into my throat. She produced a sound that was more like a shriek, yet even as I tried, my hands would not lift to my ears to keep it at bay. I felt my mental faculties melting away into nothingness, like water swirling down a drain.<br><br>Not-my eyes turned and saw my own brother Charles, and I was filled with simultaneous elation and worry: that my brother was here, and perhaps might aid me and see that I was not who I was, but yet also that he was exposed to this horrible beast that seemed to have me under its thrall. But I looked at Charles’s eyes with my own, and the spark I had known in them for so long was gone, and I understood then with coldness in my soul, that whatever the she-beast had done to me, it had done to Charles as well.<br><br>I watched with a mixture of curiosity and terror as my brother and I used our magickal abilities to lay out some tables in the garden, which I faintly recognized as our family’s own. I prayed that my family would not be here, and instead somewhere far away. We, so to say, continued this menial task, and the she-beast summoned some tablelinen and arrayed them on the tables we had set out. I began to wonder if this was a ritual, and the dinner that would be had on those tables would be the living flesh of I and Charles. I was beginning to see this as a mercy instead of an atrocity.<br><br>My thoughts were suddenly pierced by the distant shout of dear Percy, apparently he was here too, but I could not pick out the words or their meaning. Had he come to rescue us, perhaps? I tried to will the Bill-that-was-not-me to look around, but to no avail. Instead I was captivated by the beast, which used some of its own arcane magicks to grow entire plants, darkened weeds and twisted scraggly trees, to fill the garden my father and mother had so carefully cultivated. The three of us sat down, the creature positioning itself between us, when people started streaming into the garden and joining the table; and I quickly surmised that my entire dear family had joined us on this banquet; and I wished the end for them would be swift and painless.<br><br>[Next genre: <b>steampunk</b>.]</p>

            <p>Cris stepped out of the portal, and came to a stop. He looked around, and then blessed Artemis, the great huntress, showed him their location by the light of the moon. Myall followed, and watched Bill bring Aleina in.<br><br>Aphrodite&#39;s works were crafty, but Bill&#39;s execution left much to be desired. Thus, Aleina left the room to set up a bed.<br><br>Myall swore to Zeus&#39;s daughter the keeper of wisdom that this silly behavior from Bill Weasley would not stand. Cris agreed, adding an invocation to Hera that the Weasley family would not be swayed by such things.<br><br>Unfortunately, Dionysus, the reveler, had seemingly received an invocation from the beast which the two travellers called a &quot;Mary Sue&quot;: Mrs. Weasley was frantically at work to prepare the house against the guests. <i>Aliena, Charlie, Bill, and Mr. Weasley<br>almost lost their legs at breakfast as a broom zoomed underneath the<br>table.</i><br><br>The flying broom then attacked Cris and Myall, guided by the War-God&#39;s hands. However, the gods did not forget them, least of all Athena, the wise one, who came down to the earth and deflected the course of the wild broom, guiding it gently as dearest Aphrodite would guide a lover to her chamber. The broom snapped upon impact, and with a parting blessing she left just as <i>Charlie hatched a plan to make it<br>out before his mother had enlisted their help to scrub the house.</i><br><br>This affront against Zeus&#39;s steadfast wife was not taken lightly, however, and with a small whisper of the wind made Molly Weasley catch them. Cris, the warrior son of a common man, watched as everyone was made to scrub every dish clean. Pleased with herself, the mother of Ares left to watch her work.<br><br>Further was she pleased when Hermoine arrived, and the group watched as the twins were forced to scrub some more after attempting to sneak out for a small snack. Apollo, the poet, however, took issue with the fact that such focus on familial squabbles seemed to notice how this delayed the narrative, and so it placed a time skip.<br><br>This in turn angered the one who had blessed the two agents, who flew down next to the Wolf-god and began arguing with him. Ares, whose broom was blocked by the queen of fighters, came down and argued with Athena. This brought on the wrath of the goddess of love, and before long, every Olympian was in the room, arguing over who was right in the situation.<br><br>It was at this moment that Cris and Myall both agreed that they would never, <i>ever</i> leave an invocation to Athena again as long as they lived. And so, they stumbled over to Percy&#39;s room, where they watched as Percy researched cauldron bottom-thickness such that he blissfully ignored the Olympian brawl that had begun below. And so it was that they allowed the captain of the skies to intervene, breaking up the fight. Zeus reminded them that the beast known as the &quot;Mary Sue&quot; was to be slain at all costs, but this did not sway them. And so, he persuaded them to return to Olympus to finish their dispute, and every one of the heavenly beings returned to their home to finish the argument.<br><br>Cris and Myall, warriors of the PPC, wished they would never see these Olympian gods again, and made their way downstairs after the next time skip to see everyone except for Ron and Arthur Weasley sitting around the table, the goblets filled with wine that smelled of the sweetest grapes.<br><br>[Next Genre: <b>Saturday Morning Cartoon</b>]</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not absolutely positive what Greek myth as a genre is (maybe TungstenMonk can clarify), but this doesn&#39;t really seem like it. Greek mythology as a style of story-telling is more about the events and themes involved, like the heroic travels of Odysseys, the tests of Hercules, or Zeus having his way with innumerable women in innumerable forms. Basically, huge epic or nighly absurd stuff happening, but with a certain internal logic regardless. <br><br>What you&#39;ve done just sounds like two people who for some reason are very staunch believers in the Olympian gods (and it really kills the pacing). TungstenMonk introduced the idea of something weird happening to the Agents&#39; genders, for example, which would have fit right in with a Greek mythical style.</p>

            <p>The world blurred, shifting in softly misty colors like a watercolor viewed through the gemstones on an heirloom necklace. <i>They continued their conversation well into the evening,</i> the soft words of the Author murmured in their ear, and the leanly-muscled agents shivered as the chill of the timeskip caressed them.<br><br>&quot;This doesn&#39;t feel right,&quot; Myall said softly, biting her lush pink underlip. Cris&#39;s gaze was drawn, as if it were a stallion bound by his master&#39;s powerful ropes, to the sight of his partner&#39;s distress. &quot;Definitely charge for two timeskips in one go. Until the evening, a couple of lines of dialogue, and then--look out!&quot;<br><br>The agents were flung violently off their feet. Myall let out a high, pure cry, half fear and half anger, as the world lurched and seemed to try to throw them off. Cris was flung hard, but he thought only of his partner&#39;s safety. Gritting his teeth, he reached out one long arm and wrapped it firmly around Myall&#39;s waist, drawing her closer and pulling them both down on the green-dappled floor of the forest.<br><br>His pulse pounded in his ears as Myall clung to him. Cool sweat streaked her forehead and long graceful throat, and her eyes were wide with doe-eyed annoyance. She was warm against him, so warm, her curves molded against his hard flat planes, the pair of them huddled together on the forest floor as the world writhed frantically around them.<br><br>&quot;I hate timeskips,&quot; Myall murmured, her breath a cool breeze against Cris&#39;s cheek. He did his best to restrain himself from pulling her closer. &quot;Also, get your hand off my butt.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er . . . sorry.&quot; Cris blinked, trying valiantly to drive the feel of Myall&#39;s soft velvety skin from his mind. &quot;I think this &#39;fic is affecting us. I feel . . . weird.&quot; He gazed down at her, drinking in the sight of her. &quot;Dazed. Like I&#39;m dreaming.&quot;<br><br>The world righted itself for a moment, and the two cautiously climbed to their feet. The Author whispered again, her gentle voice making their soft hair sway in the breeze. <i>They spent more and more time together throughout the next three years, and his parents were only too happy to have an elf in the family . . .</i> And there it was again, the blurring, the mist, and again the wrenching as they were flung like leaves in the wind by the monstrous timeskip.<br><br>This time, Cris flung them both to the ground and crouched over Myall. She gazed up at him, her chest heaving as she fought to breathe, one hand knotted into the cloth of his uniform shirt over his heart. She could feel the pounding now, the thunder of his hot-blooded pulse against her cool white fingers, and her eyes widened as she gazed up at him. Around the pair, the world was going mad, three years of time whirring by in moments. For the agents, it might have been a thousand.<br><br>&quot;Cris,&quot; Myall said softly.<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot; Cris whispered, afraid to breathe.<br><br>&quot;Were you always a man?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; Cris paused. His confusion wasn&#39;t helped by the fact that in the whirlwind of the timeskip, a small rock had just smacked him in the forehead. &quot;I . . . don&#39;t remember?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Get out the portal generator,&quot; Myall commanded, her soft voice sending a thrum of pleasure through her partner. &quot;I don&#39;t want to know what the hell&#39;s going on here, and I don&#39;t want to know. Portal us to chapter two. And I believe I said <i>get your hand off my butt.</i>&quot;<br><br>[Next genre: <b>Greek myth.</b>]</p>

            <p>I stared at the console, at the smoke rising from the back and coiling in the harsh glare of the fluorescent light. Coiling like a snake, a snake that was also made out of smoke. A Sue. Oh, sure, we’d dealt with Sues before, they were a dime a dozen even down here in Floaters. Those dames were always trouble with a capital T, and a capital ROUBLE as well. Maybe it was the burrito I had just, against all better advice, taken a bite out of, but there was something in my gut telling me this mission was going to go south faster than a migratory bird on an all-caffeine diet.<br><br>Speaking of dubious diets, my partner Myall was busy cramming another one of those burritos into her mouth. I hoped she wouldn’t get indigestion – the last thing you needed on the mean streets of fanfic patrol was a tummyache. Fastest way to be put in a Chicago overcoat was to let your guard down around a Sue. They’d ice you or brainwash you faster than you could say “don’t ice me or brainwash me”.<br><br>And yet Myall was busy throwing caution to the wind like a frisbee. That broad was crazier than a Bad Slasher who volunteered for permanent Kingdom Hearts duty. But we all have to take the cards we’re dealt in life – whether they’re aces or jokers.<br><br>A silhouette moved past the window in our door, which was odd, since our door hadn’t had a window a moment ago. There was a gentle knock, or more like a rustling, like the sound a plant might make if it knocked on a door. Then the door opened, and we saw that a plant had knocked on the door.<br><br>The Floating Hyacinth walked into our office, smooth as a bald man’s scalp. She had a body like a fine violin, in that they were both composed largely of vegetable matter, and her fronds swayed back and forth like… fronds, swaying back and forth. I could tell this Flower was going to be trouble – but then, Flowers always are.<br><br><i>Agents,</i> the Hyacinth said in a voice like a dream: that is, entirely within our minds. <i>I trust you received your mission alright.</i><br><br>“Yeah,” I said, not trusting the plant as far as I could spit. Which was pretty far, actually, if I say so myself. “Yeah, we got your mission. Why come down here personally?”<br><br>The Hyacinth chuckled. <i>I just wanted to… make sure you were going to do your jobs properly. This fic is serious business, Agents. I don’t want you messing it up like Santa Destroy.</i><br><br>Santa Destroy. I gritted my teeth. That failed No More Heroes mission was dead now, dead and buried like a zombie that hadn’t come back to life, but it still followed us around, haunting us like a zombie that had come back to life.<br><br>“We’ll get it done, Hyacinth. You just make sure and pony up the dough.”<br><br>Another chuckle. <i>I’ll tell Human Resources to get right on it.</i> I was fairly certain there was no Human Resources, but before I could tell her that, she was already walking out, cool as a cucumber in the heart of a glacier.<br><br>I turned to Myall. “Come on. Let’s skedaddle before the boss lady decides to come back for round two.” <br><br>We grabbed our trusty gear – well-worn, all half broken, but then what wasn’t, in this end of the PPC (or the entire PPC) – and set the controls. The portal popped open like the gates of Hell themselves – but this wasn’t Hell. This was badfic, and badfic could be much worse, like a thing that is much worse.<br><br>We stepped through the portal and into pre-fic space, empty as a politician’s soul and white as a polar bear eating vanilla ice cream out of a plain china bowl with a plastic disposable spoon in the middle of a blizzard, and waited for the nightmare to begin. Or the fic, rather.<br><br><b>Next prompt: TEXT ADVENTURE.</b></p>

            <p>Once the Console had been restored to good repair and the two Agents had the full report available, they knew they had a particularly vicious and complicated case on their hands: several breaches of canon, and heinous crimes against good taste. The intelligence report indicated that the continuity involved was Harry Potter. This was a continuity riddled with such problems due to its massive popularity, and required constant vigilance on the part of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. Agents Wirewood and Bromia did not have any particular experience in solving canon breaches involving the Harry Potter continuity, but the mission briefing assured them that their knowledge of the continuity would suffice; and due to the aforementioned frequency of Harry Potter missions, most Agents had some experience working with the continuity regardless. On the other hand, the fact that no specialist was necessary spoke of the seriousness of the crime.<br><br>The story involved a Mary Sue of unknown magnitude, many instances of wild Out of Character behaviour, and overuse of adverbs. To the Agents’ chagrin, large parts of the report had been corrupted by “technical difficulties”, meaning they would be going in partially blind. A lot of the Agents’ work, and even their very survival, would hinge on their own reconnaissance of the story. It was clear, then, that they would need to infiltrate the story itself to compile the needed evidence and then finally be judge, jury and executioner to the Mary Sue, whose identity was unknown at the time. This was their job, and they were reasonably ready for it.<br><br>To deal with breaches of Canon and crimes against it, the Protectors of the Plot Continuum have a multitude of devices and technologies at their disposal. The Console is able to generate a portal that allows the Agents access into the various dimensions of the multiverse. This portal can be activated even from within the fic, at will, using a remote activator. Once on the ground, they could use Character Analysis Devices to determine the level of canonicity or OOCity in the mission.<br><br>However, it was Agent Bromia’s firm opinion that the best and most useful tool in an Agent’s arsenal was the notepad and the pen. Agent Wirewood was not similarly convinced, and the two would often argue on the merits of gathering charges “in your head” or by simply writing them down. The debate between the two schools of thought rages to this day.<br><br>After familiarizing themselves with the intelligence -- what there was of it -- the Agents prepared for the task ahead, both mentally and in practice. The division of labour was that Agent Bromia would gather up the necessary foodstuffs, estimating the length of the mission to be, while Agent Wirewood would collect their various investigative devices and ensure that they were still functional. This was a complicated and thorough process, which needed to be done properly because the Agents’ success depended on their equipment being in as sharp a condition as possible. Agent Wirewood spent roughly five minutes on it before every mission, and most of those minutes were consumed by finding where the CAD had been stowed: it was, after all, a device with many uses, and on this occasion it had been employed as a doorstop.<br><br>Everything finally ready, it was time to open the portal and enter the story itself. <br><br>[The genre prompt for the next one is <b>noir</b>.]</p>

            <p>Cris leaped out from her sleeping quarters and strode to the console.  Sitting in the chair—barely beating Myall, who had attempted to race her into it—Cris pressed the Accept button.  She began to read the Intelligence report when the console’s viewing screen flickered and static obscured the report.<br><br>Cris frowned.  “What’s happening?”<br><br>Myall forced down a mouthful of burrito before saying, “There must have been some kind of power fluctuation at DoDAEG!  Hang on.”  She knelt down and yanked on a side panel of the console that had clearly seen many such yanks before.  “I think I can increase the power flow to our RC if I cross these wires.”<br><br>The inside of the console was a mess of wires, and also a rat skeleton, leading away into shadows that seemed just a little too dark and vast, even for a machine as large as a console.  Metal boxes were suspended from the underside of the keyboard, and others were rising from the floor, all with tangles of wires interconnecting them all or leading to the monitor above.  Some wires hung limply with only one end plugged into something.  Others were suspended in midair, plugged into themselves.  Numerous circuit boards were leaning against one another, with motherboards accompanied by fatherboards and babyboards, all held immobile by the tractor beams of mothershipboards.  A tower of miniature subwoofers occupied a near corner, stacked atop each other and leaning against the console’s casing and the various wires and boxes and circuits.  In the dead center of the space that the console actually appeared to inhabit was the CPU, a shining metal canister covered in removable panels with lights like those on a <i>Tron</i> suit racing all around it.  Occasionally, small bolts of electricity arced outwards from the CPU, and the smell of burning rubber was slowly beginning to fill the air.<br><br>Myall reached inside, and Cris watched in confusion as she started rearranging wires with one hand, since the other was still holding the half-eaten burrito.  “Oh, that leaves too many ports exposed.  If I open this panel, I can get some more wires from the inside to the outside, so long as this doesn’t start sparking.  I wish we had remembered to pick up that bag of fuses before we left that deletion!  I’ve never seen this before, I wonder mah mah mum mum.”  <br>Her speech degenerated into mumbles as the burrito found its way into her mouth once again.<br><br>Impatient, Cris rolled her eyes and looked back the console, hoping to see some sign of life from the machine.  A red glow in the corner of her eye caught her attention instead.<br><br>“Uh.  Myall.  I think I see the source of the problem.”<br><br>Myall snickered.  “No offense, Cris-y, but a PPC console is a very delicate piece of equipment, and—”<br><br>“And a toaster, by contrast, isn’t.  Hence why it tends to cause problems when someone puts spoons in the bread slots and turns it on.”<br><br>Myall peeked out from behind the console, a bit of lettuce hanging out of her mouth.  “Problems?”<br><br>“Yes, problems, like futzing with anything else nearby running off the same energy source.”  Cris rolled herself over to the toaster with a push against the front of the console and yanked the toaster cord out of the wall.<br><br>After a moment, the console’s screen once again displayed the intelligence report for their new mission.<br><br>“What were you trying to do, exactly?”<br><br>“Melt spoons down into sporks.”<br><br>Next genre prompt:<br><b>true crime</b></p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve assimilated myself quite nicely, so here, let&#39;s meet the members of Response Centre 9001, Department of Floaters.<br><br>Agent #1 - Joseph Vladimir<br><br>Species: Human - Homo sapien sapiens<br><br>Gender: Male<br><br>Age: 20 (Born 29th April 1992)<br><br>Appearance: Joseph is a somewhat tall person, standing at around a metre eighty, which isn&#39;t actually that tall, seeing that it is merely a few centimetres taller than average. He possesses black hair with a fringe that hangs over his forehead , a physical trait inherited from his father. However, his eye colour takes after his mother&#39;s - a warm brown. His choice of clothing includes a long-sleeved polo shirt in the standard PPC black, along with a grey windbreaker that has the Floater Department flash patch stitched on. He also wears dark blue jeans, which is expected, seeing that everyone needs to wear pants.<br><br>Personality: Joseph is a rather quiet person, preferring to wait for others to speak to him first, possibly due to the fact that he may or may not be daydreaming nearly every single moment of the day. However, at times he does actually speak up, possibly to remark on whatever strange thing is going on at the current time, or when he is ordering food from wherever he buys his food at, or when he is servicing people as a worker at his local Subway restaurant.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, Joseph actually does have a sense of humour, but rarely shows it, seeing that he doesn&#39;t actually talk much to people. The belief that he is lacking a sense of humour comes from the fact that he takes things rather literally at times, a habit he has failed to suppress over the years. However, he has learnt to merely accept the joke without trying to understand it, knowing that his responses are rather awkward for whoever he is speaking to at the time.<br><br>Joseph is also somewhat addicted to all works of fiction, and immerses himself in whatever fandom he has found himself liking, until he finally gets somewhat bored of getting addicted to it and moves on to something else. However, he still goes back to past fandoms every now and then to relive the joy that comes from experiencing the stories of said fandom.<br><br>History: Joseph, as a human being that originates from the Earth of the &#39;Real World&#39;, lived a rather average life in Victoria, Australia. Obviously this may sound clichйd, but in this instance, an &#39;average&#39; life means that there were absolutely no supernatural occurrences or anything else that goes against the natural laws of the &#39;Real World&#39;.<br><br>Born on the 29th of April 1992, the young man of Eastern European descent went to his local secondary college in his area of Victoria, and later went to study at Melbourne University, where he still goes to despite the fact that he now works for the PPC. It was around this time when he ended up getting recruited into the organisation by some agents, which reduced his study time greatly.<br><br>However, he somehow managed to balance both PPC work and studying successfully, and even managed to get a part time job at his local Subway restaurant, because he needs an actual salary.<br><br>After a year of being an agent, he now works in the Department of Floaters, for he wishes to do a variety of things in his attempt at protecting the plot continuum.<br><br>Weapons: A Carving Knife, because it is perfectly possible to carry one around in the Real World without getting arrested, and it can be used while preparing dinner (after cleaning off the blood of Sues of course.)<br><br>Lust Objects: Nyarlathotep from Demonbane.<br><br>Fandoms: Mecha-related series (Mazinger Z, Getter Robo, Gundam, etc.); the Nasuverse and Magical Girls in general (Lyrical Nanoha, Pretty Cure, etc.). He also is interested in several other fandoms.<br><br>---<br><br>Agent #2 - Andrew Jones<br><br>Species: Human - Homo sapien sapiens<br><br>Gender: Male<br><br>Age: 19 (Born January 4 1993)<br><br>Appearance: Andrew, despite being the average height for most people his age (a metre and seventy-five centimetres), appears to be rather short, due to the fact that his partner is taller than him. He has reddish-brown hair, which is rather messy, and is tied up into a ponytail. His eyes are a cloudy blue. His usual outfit consists of a standard PPC black t-shirt and navy blue jeans, but he is known to don a grey sweater at times. His Department of Floaters flash-patch is stitched onto the front of his t-shirt.<br><br>Personality: Andrew is a somewhat energetic person, and possess a rather optimistic outlook on life. He subscribes to the theory that being positive can help one get past all the hardships of life. However, he is known to be rather sarcastic at times, when there are too many things for him to handle, and when he is too grumpy and tired to actually try and be positive. Or when he doesn&#39;t get his daily dose of coffee.<br><br>The nineteen year old, having been exposed to many forms of fiction over his life (along with being a Troper), can easily recognise what literary devices/plot points/etc. are coming up, for many &#39;tropes&#39; are repeated over and over again in works of fiction, for there is no original idea, merely recycled ones. This has also given him the habit of randomly quoting TvTropes (which is incredibly irritating for everyone), and trying to see if the Laws of Narrative work inside badfics.<br><br>He can also be rather dramatic.<br><br>History: Like his partner, Andrew was also a resident from the &#39;Real World&#39;. Unlike his partner however, he doesn&#39;t actually seem to have many connections to his homeworld, possibly because he never actually mentions what his life was like before joining the PPC. However, it is assumed that he found it somewhat boring, which lead to his recruitment.<br><br>As an agent in the PPC, he ended up getting placed in the Janitorial Division for quite some time, before being shuffled over into the Department of Floaters.<br><br>Weapons: A long wooden stick. Possibly a broom without the fluffy thing. Good for bludgeoning things.<br><br>Lust Objects: Sen Yarizui from Ben-To<br><br>Fandoms: Random assortment of anime; Discworld; Power Rangers; Some Sci-Fi series.<br><br>---<br><br>Writing Sample:<br><br>Andrew yawned as he continued to browse through the summaries of every single Star Trek episode that had its own page on Wikipedia, the sickly dim light of his monitor being the only light source in the dark room. He had absolutely no idea how long he had been reading, but he didn&#39;t really either way, for he was rather fascinated by the episode summaries.<br><br>A small voice in his mind told him that Memory Alpha had more information, but he ignored it, knowing that he&#39;d end up reading all the pages on the Star Trek wiki if he decided to venture there.<br><br>A quick glance at the clock in the lower right corner of his monitor told him the time. 5 AM. Possibly in the morning, seeing that it was a bit too dark for it to be 5 PM. With the revelation of the time, the nineteen year old realised that he had been reading through the episode summaries for eight hours non-stop, without any food, drink or trips to the bathroom.<br><br>&quot;I missed dinner?&quot; he thought aloud, despite the fact that it was perfectly possible to think without voicing it in the physical realm. &quot;Bugger. I should really cook up something.&quot;<br><br>However, whatever plans he had for cooking a meal for himself in the early morning were interrupted by the appearance of Joseph, who, for some strange reason, had most of his body inside a sleeping bag, and was sleepily crawling through the room towards their shared kitchen.<br><br>&quot;Why are you awake?&quot; asked the teenager slowly as he looked incredulously at his friend.<br><br>&quot;Breakfast,&quot; was the simple clipped reply as Joseph ignored Andrew once more as he continued to crawl along the floor.<br><br>&quot;But it&#39;s only ...&quot; Andrew glanced at the time once more. &quot; ... 5.05 AM! Why would you have to eat breakfast at this time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Allows for more time in day.&quot;<br><br>Andrew groaned, wondering why he had such an enigmatic partner. Sure, he too was awake at such a time, but he had a better reason than &#39;Early breakfast so I spend more time doing things&#39;. Well, it wasn&#39;t actually that good of a reason, seeing that he had been spending eight hours reading through episode summaries of Star Trek.<br><br>&quot;You know what,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Make me something as well. I&#39;m hungry. Just don&#39;t make cupcakes. I despise cupcakes.&quot;<br><br>There was no reply from Joseph, who had already disappeared into the kitchen. Several seconds later, the lights in the aforementioned part of the house turned on, the brightness of the glow even managing to illuminate the darkness of the room Andrew was in. This also had the side-effect of hurting Andrew&#39;s eyes, seeing that he didn&#39;t have time to adjust to the light.<br><br>&quot;OH GOD MY EYES! THEY BURN!&quot;<br><br>As the nineteen year old continued to dramatically scream, Joseph continued to make breakfast, his lower body still inside his sleeping bag. It was a daily routine, with the only difference today being the presence of Andrew, meaning that he would have to make more than just a meal for himself. He paused for a moment, wondering if he should make waffles or pancakes, before finally deciding to just settle with French toast.<br><br>From the living room, a cracking noise was heard.<br><br>&quot;JOSEPH! I THINK I BROKE THE CHAIR!&quot;<br><br>The twenty year old shook his head, and, after quickly turning off the gas, made his way towards the living room once more.<br><br>Just another usual morning for the two agents.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s get straight to the point.  Permission Denied.  There are a number of reasons for this.<br><br>1) You contradict yourself several times in this post.  <br><br>&quot;Joseph is a <b>somewhat tall</b> person, standing at around a metre eighty, which <b>isn&#39;t actually that tall</b>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Andrew, despite being the <b>average height</b> for most people his age (a metre and seventy-five centimetres), appears to be <b>rather short</b>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just another <b>usual</b> morning for the two agents.&quot;  In this case, you&#39;ve been telling us how this isn&#39;t a usual morning for them.<br><br>2) Modifiers like <i>perhaps, may or may not, somewhat, and possibly</i> are fine to use, in moderation.  If you use them to much, like you did in this post, they make it impossible to determine what is actually being said.  There are a lot of modifiers in this post that are unnecessary.<br><br>I can see what you are trying to do with some of it.  You are going for ironic humor.  However, you keep doing the same thing over and over again, with too many modifiers, and it is really falling flat.<br><br>3) Logic errors.  <br><br>Joseph is in the PPC, going to University, and working a part-time job.  That is a huge amount of work.  When does he find time to sleep?  Or study?  Or spend his money?<br><br>Andrew has been reading Wikipedia for eight hours.  It is 5AM now, so that means he started around 9PM.  Why would he even think that it was possible that it was 5PM?  That would be 20 hours of no food, drink, or trips to the bathroom.<br><br>4)  There is absolutely no indication that these guys are in the PPC, except for the last line.  Them not being in the PPC wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, but the fact that they are raises issues.  They have a house, apparently, which means they aren&#39;t in RC 9001.  They have time to sleep and read 8 hours worth of Wikipedia, without interruption from a console.  There is no console, that I can tell.<br><br>5) <i>&quot;Breakfast,&quot; was the simple clipped reply as Joseph ignored Andrew once more as he continued to crawl along the floor.</i>  If you don&#39;t know what is wrong with this sentence, read this article on the wiki: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ing_Disease#As_Disease">As Disease</a><br><br>6) When I saw this request my first reaction was, &quot;Who?&quot;  You say you&#39;ve assimilated nicely, but I read the Board daily and I do go into the chat (infrequently, true, but still), and I had no idea who you were.<br><br><br>Long story short, I am denying permission mainly based on your level of writing not being high enough.  Not knowing who you are is easily fixed, but the writing is going to need some work before you are ready to write for the PPC.<br><br>So, please, hang around some more, work on your writing, and ask again when you&#39;re ready.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>When talking about contradictions, someone could be average height, but appear short, due to their build. If they&#39;re quite stocky it would make them seem to be shorter than they actually are, if there was no frame of reference nearby. <br><br>Having said that, I do agree with all your other comments, and would like to thank you for that link to &#39;As disease&#39; - I hadn&#39;t come across that page on the wiki yet, and I found the referenced article in there on writing for fiction very informative. </p>

            <p>You are correct that someone may appear short because of their build.  However, the stated reason for Andrew appearing short is because his partner is taller than him.  If you look at the numbers, we are talking a difference of only 5cm.  That is really not enough to make someone seem short.  It is less than two inches.  A person&#39;s hair could make that difference pretty much disappear with little difficulty.<br><br>Also, you can thank Neshomeh for both the link to As Disease and for the article it referenced.  She wrote the As Disease section after one of her missions, and found the article.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>The movie the Avengers is coming out, and we all know what that means--more badfic. Possibly an explosion of crossover madness. So get ready, I suppose... <br><br>Feel free to spout off what you think about the movie, if you see it. I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but I&#39;m excited. I mean, it&#39;s Joss Whedon. He&#39;s legendary. And it has a team of normal humans working with many magical, super powerful beings as well in a sort of vigilante/peacekeeping way, which is vaguely PPC-ish.<br><br>And, well, explosions.

            <p>It was <i>fantastic</i>, and the audience actually applauded several times. (Particularly at that scene with Loki and the Hulk. You know the one.) Joss left his metaphorical thumbprints all over it, but in a good way- lots of hilarious one-liners, managing to effectively establish a lot of characters in not too much time, and, of course, the heart-wrenching death of a minor character everyone liked and never expected to die. :P I plan to drag the rest of my family to it after finals are over.</p>

            <p>The audience here cracked up at the Loki-Hulk scene :) .<br><br>My only objection, and a minor one, is that they didn&#39;t pull in that scene from an early Avengers comic where Cap picked up Mjolnir and handed it back to Thor.

            <p>I haven&#39;t gone looking for any Avengers badfic yet, and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to after enjoying the film so much, but I was wondering how it would be treated by the PPC.<br><br>Is The Avengers a continuum in its own right (AU version of the component continua, or just an umbrella term for all of them), a legitimate (i.e. non-implausible) crossover of the various original continua, or maybe even something else entirely?<br><br>Just wondering what it would mean for agents dealing with any of the continua involved, and how they would determine if things were going against canon or not.

            <p>Comic book universes are all vast and complex and interconnected in even more complex ways. There are discreet Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor universes, and then there&#39;s the Avengers universe, which gets to pick and choose the elements from the other four that all fit together and leave out anything that doesn&#39;t work. So, what&#39;s a canon break in Avengers isn&#39;t necessarily a canon break in the Iron Man universe, and vice versa.<br><br>Where PPCing is concerned, the question is, what continuum does the fic <i>say</i> it&#39;s set in? If the fic says it&#39;s an Avengers fic, then you PPC based on Avengers canon, which includes elements of all four of the component &#39;verses plus some of its own, but you can&#39;t charge for anything that doesn&#39;t actually appear in Avengers-verse. Similarly, if it says it&#39;s an Iron Man fic, then you can&#39;t charge for violations based on the Hulkverse or the Thorverse or anything not particular to the discreet Iron Man canon. (You can charge for pulling in elements from other canons that don&#39;t belong there, though.) Unless it&#39;s an Iron Man and Hulk crossover, but that&#39;s something else again. Also, if it&#39;s a movieverse fic, you don&#39;t get to charge for stuff that only shows up in the comics, and vice versa.<br><br>As far as these films are concerned, though, they are pretty explicitly set up as a series—they all take place in the Avengers universe.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... is that the Marvel films blend together elements of Marvel Comics two main &quot;universes&quot;; the mainstream Marvel titles and Ultimate Marvel.  I&#39;d call the films a separate continuity, myself.<br><br>However, I also understand that the films are supposed to all be set in the same world.  So, an Avengers badfic that contradicts something established in the Thor movie could be charged for it, even if that element never came up in Avengers.</p>

            <p>... something that comes up in a movie-verse Thor badfic that directly contradicts something in a movie-verse Iron Man badfic would be a canon break.<br><br>I think we&#39;re best off asking Meta about this: he posted a mission in the Avengers continuum some time around the beginning of the year.</p>

            <p>The thing is is that the Marvel universe is its own continuum. The Avengers is a legitimate part of the Marvel universe. They can come INTO the actual comic books where the heroes are and do things. So... any ooc-ness in the ENTIRE Marvel continuum is oocness.

            <p>Lucky you. All my dad has shared with me is his persistent efforts in converting me to Harmony (it&#39;s really scary the way he spouts stereotypical Harmonian arguments without having seen that sort of thing online at all!) and the insistence that I couldn&#39;t complain about Twilight without having read it. He did get me His Dark Materials though (even if at far too young an age) and I&#39;m the reason he&#39;s reading the Hunger Games--and possibly why he read Harry Potter. Oh, wait--he gave me my first Discworld book, I think. Even if he has barely read any however much I nag him. All is forgiven!  </p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>I was wondering if anyone could explain to my why My Little Pony seems to have such a huge cult following at the moment. I have only really become aware of this in the past few days, mainly through (loosely) following goings-on on this site. Before that, all I had heard was that deviantart is, allegedly, full of MLP pictures, and a rumour that this began on 4chan.<br><br>It may be hard for some of you to understand, but I felt a good deal of shock and horror when I realised that this is something that a lot of people take seriously. You could call it &quot;culture shock&quot;. MLP was not part of my childhood - I was already well past the target age range when it was first introduced, and for a very long time it was something of a laughing stock for older people. It was the stereotyped example people used of a sexist and rather pointless toy for 3 year old girls. I didn&#39;t become aware there was even a cartoon of MLP until a few years ago. I think I have actually seen it exactly once in my entire life.<br><br>So it must be admitted there could be something I&#39;m missing out on here. A lot of children&#39;s programmes are, in fact, very good. After all, the best ones are designed with the knowledge that grown-ups are going to be forced to watch them as well. Without this, one would quickly become insane whilst keeping toddlers and small children company when watching their favourite tv programmes.<br><br>In the past other programmes aimed at the very young have gained cult followings amongst an older age group - for example Teletubbies became very popular with college students. As far as I know, this sort of thing tends to be due to a fortuitous combination of scheduling times, psychedelic visuals and general silliness that can be quite appealing.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve seen anything quite like the MLP phenomenon. Granted, I&#39;ve only been aware of it for a few days: but it looks as though it has a huge, devoted fan base. Does anybody have any thoughts, opinions or facts on how this came to be? This appears to be relatively recent - is it the latest incarnation of MLP that is simply superior? Was it originally ironic in some way? Or is it that the &quot;MLP generation&quot; grew up, and some people still have a lot of fondness for something that was originally a childhood thing?<br><br>I&#39;m not trying to insult anyone or hurt anyone&#39;s feelings. Seriously, I am probably much too old to even be here, never mind understanding current &quot;youth&quot; trends. So don&#39;t take it personally. <br><br>If it makes anyone feel better, when I was around seven or eight years old I used to write stories set in a fantasy world populated by brightly-coloured unicorns and flying horses. I&#39;m generally too embarrassed to admit to that! But I really enjoyed it at the time. I was quite peeved when MLP appeared (although I had stopped writing those stories by then).<br><br>I have a feeling that my recent surfing has only turned up the craziest of the crazy, which is probably contributing to my discomfort about this subject.<br><br>I needed to write this as a form of catharsis: for some reason this has been really niggling at me. I don&#39;t mind if nobody replies, but I&#39;d be interested to hear anyone&#39;s take on this phenomenon, whether it&#39;s explaining the awesomeness of MLP, hating on it, a sociological perspective or any other.<br><br>There isn&#39;t anywhere else I can post this that people will even give two hoots, or probably even know what on earth I&#39;m talking about ... so apologies if you feel this is misuse of the board.</p>

            <p>It sort of help hat the original creator, Lauren Faust, had a fairly decent following from before she did MLP. Her previous two shows, Powerpuff Girls and Foster&#39;s Home for Imaginary Friends, were fairly popular and now most of the people who were fans of those shows have grown up a bit, and upon hearing that Faust was doing another show, most of them decided to give it a shot, and found that they liked it.<br><br>(I sat &quot;them&quot; but to be honest, I fall into this category as well.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going to judge you for being honestly confused. It does seem pretty insane if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. {= )<br><br>So, clarification first: the thing people are obsessing over is not the toy line, or any of the old TV shows, but a new show originally developed by Lauren Faust in 2010, called <i>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</i>.<br><br>The appeal is manifold: first of all, it&#39;s not at all the bland &quot;girl&quot; programming of the old cartoons. Lauren Faust expressly wanted to get away from that, because girls too like stories in which the main characters can be strong, feisty, proactive, etc.—but also make mistakes and have to face consequences for their actions. There are real conflicts that real groups of friends face, and each of the main characters has a distinct personality and set of interests. (Hey kids! It&#39;s okay to be yourself!) Also, there is that adult appeal, too. For instance, one of my favorite episodes of the first season (I haven&#39;t seen the second beyond the premiere) features a musical number based on Sondheim&#39;s &quot;Putting It Together&quot; (<a href="http://www.hubworld.com/watch/914015297001/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-season-1-song-clip-2-suited-for-success">watch an official clip here!</a>), and there&#39;s another episode that uses the Benny Hill theme.<br><br>Also, IMO, it&#39;s really, really refreshing to see stories in which the whole point is something like learning to communicate effectively to prevent misunderstandings, or accepting each other&#39;s differences and being friends anyway, or hey, friends fight sometimes, and <i>it&#39;s not the end of the world</i>, because forgiveness! And it&#39;s not condescending or preachy about it, either, which helps make it accessible to older people.<br><br>So, I hope that clears it up a bit. If you really want to see for yourself what the big deal is, though, I recommend watching a few episodes. I don&#39;t know what official availability is, but you can probably scare up an episode or two somewhere online if doing so doesn&#39;t bother you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...episodes can be purchased on iTunes. There has been no DVD release as of yet. YOff the record, though, there are some people who post a new episode to YouTube by the time 24 hours have passed since the new episode is aired.<br><br>And yeah, you pretty much hit the nail on the head there. Don&#39;t forget, too, that the characters are really engaging, and that the show isn&#39;t above making fun of some of their eccentricities.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s interesting that they have gone for a complete reworking of the concept - I must say I approve, judging by what you have described. <br><br>I tried to watch the clip that you linked but, sadly, it isn&#39;t loading for me. Often I have found that American websites won&#39;t allow clips of their tv shows to play when people are viewing from outside the USA - it could be that.<br><br>It absolutely sounds as though they are trying to appeal to a much older audience, if references to Sondheim and Benny Hill are anything to go by. That gives me clues that there may be themes or ideas in this show which are philosophically deep, perhaps with some references that can only be appreciated by adults.<br><br>It is only a matter of time before I get bored enough to try to find one of the episodes and watch it. I&#39;ll try YouTube ... sometime. I think I will need to be in the right sort of mood to actually concentrate on following a cartoon closely enough to &quot;get&quot; it.<br><br>It did occur to me that maybe it&#39;s just an illusion that MLP is such a cult, and that perhaps it is simply that these days everything has its own following, what with the internet and all ... These days it seems any niche you can imagine has its own social scene. I actually woke up this morning in a semi-dream/nightmare where I was able to perceive and appreciate the vastness of the world, i.e. the number of people in it. This was directly caused by my recent surfing, discovering yet more of the gob-smacking silliness (and sometimes downright perversity) that is the internet!</p>

            <p>I just looked up who Sondheim is, to be sure - I associated his name with West Side Story, and that was correct ... but what just struck me was that using Benny Hill is something of a meta-reference. At first I just thought &quot;gosh, that is really old!&quot;, but of course he is still having re-runs abroad and is popular all around the world.<br><br>What made me call it a &quot;meta-reference&quot; is that Benny Hill was famous for being a show that adults could enjoy with children, in specific because a lot of his humour was very risquй but done in a manner that passed over children&#39;s heads. Somehow I doubt it was really intended in that way, but certainly they are using cultural references that children simply won&#39;t be aware of, to add that &quot;extra dimension&quot; for adults.<br><br>Thanks again both of you for taking my question seriously and trying to enlighten me!</p>

            <p>That does help me understand a little of what is going on!<br><br>When you say the author goes out of her way to make people happy, does this imply that there is some kind of two-way process going on when the shows are written? By this I mean reading feedback from fans and taking suggestions about what they would like to happen in the stories.<br><br>If that is what you meant, I imagine it would not have been possible until recent years due to the proliferation of internet connections etc.</p>

            <p>The creator keeps an eye on what her fans like and slips it into the show. There&#39;s a handful of ponies that were supposed to be background characters, but became popular for one reason or another in the fandom. She slips them into the show now, and gives them speaking roles, just so the fans can geek out.<br><br>Example: A pony that bears a resemblance to David Tennant. <br><img src="http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/157/4/a/dr_whooves_vector_by_project_hedgecat-d3i6kz3.png" alt="http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/157/4/a/dr_whooves_vector_by_project_hedgecat-d3i6kz3.png"><br>This little guy got nicknamed Dr. Whooves by the Fandom, and she makes a point of slipping him in every so often.</p>

            <p>This was a fun read!  It feels like it was a fairly long badfic, but you guys kept the pace going so that the mission didn&#39;t bog down.  I also had no trouble keeping track of who was who, which canons had been replaced, etc. thanks to the mission feeling very character-driven, even on the part of the replacements.  I also understood what was happening with the Nanohaverse magic, which is crucial, because I don&#39;t know that series.<br><br>It was a nice change of pace to see a crossover with <i>Harry Potter</i> without the <i>Potter</i> elements dominating the story.  You reflected this in the mission well, too, letting Ari and Corolla handle the majority of the dangerous work using Nanohaverse powers.</p>

            <p>I really like how each agent drives the other up the wall. It&#39;s going to be very interesting watching these two on future missions. Don&#39;t feel bad about making mistakes: nobody&#39;s going to come around and chew you out for it. Besides, this piece was inspired by the aforementioned mistake and it turned out quite well. Let the plot bunnies pop up whenever they can!<br><br>On a side note, don&#39;t forget to add pages on the wiki for your characters and links to their missions!</p>

She&#39;s overly excitable, a bit of a spaz, dogmatic, fangirly, and a babbler. Often &#39;downloads&#39; at people, rambling on and on about random, minor facts no one tends to care about. MASSIVE Potterhead, Whovian, and obsessed with a few other fandoms no one knows anything about. (E.G. the Gammage Cup.) She tends to speak in all manner of other languages and quotes. Says &#39;Allons-y&#39; a lot. Enjoys writing charge lists. Loud, opinionated, and bookish. Easily grossed out by smut, gore, and other nastiness, though she has a bit of a penchant for GOOD slash. In a co-dependent relationship with her laptop, which she named &#39;Spot&#39; after Dairine&#39;s computer. Her favorite weapon is a Muggle-Use wand, backed up by a paper-knife replica of Gandalf&#39;s sword. Her favorite music- since it seems to come up so much- is &#39;80s synth pop, goth rock from the &#39;80s, Vocaloid, and the Myst soundtrack. LO&#39;s include the Tenth Doctor, Rory Williams, Jack Harkness, Sherlock Holmes, Tony Stark, Roy Mustang, Harry Potter, and Alfred F. Jones.<br><br>Skelter: A Smoker zombie from the Left 4 Dead continuum. He looks... frankly, disgusting. Large, disgusting, tumorous pustules cover half his face and blob along his arms, and a fetid odor surrounds him. He&#39;s extremely tall- nearly six foot- and lanky, with wild black hair and sunken, glassy eyes. Twitches nervously a lot- his most defining nervous tic is that he&#39;ll occasionally lick various parts of his face with his several-foot-long tongue. The mehfic he was in granted him sentience, but he still has to refrain from eating people. Fortunately for the world, he&#39;s laid-back and has decent amounts of willpower... but he can&#39;t always shake the urge to climb to a high place, grab a passerby, and om nom nom nom.  Skelter is upbeat and more than a bit ADD. He is the EPITOME of fanboy... even in his continuum, he&#39;d almost rather find a comic book shop than a Survivor camp, and he nicknamed the members of his zombie crew after superheroes. (The Witch was PMS Avenger.)  He&#39;s optimistic, stubborn, shy, and geeky. He coughs and wheezes a lot, and is equipped with a translator so that people other than the undead can understand him. Oh, and he&#39;s kinda gay- he&#39;s from a Smoker X Hunter fic, which explains a lot.  Musical tastes include Muse, Coldplay, All-American Rejects, and Gorillaz; LO&#39;s include all three New!Who Doctors, Captain Jack Harkness, Wolverine, Hal Jordan, and Mal Reynolds. If he&#39;s within range of ANY of these people, he must be restrained unless you WANT them caught in an Awkward Zombie Hug. (Especially for Mal and Wolverine, that would not end well.) Fighting style: He grabs people with his extremely long tongue and strangles them. <br><br>TL;DR: Lola is me, Skelter is a zombie fanboy.<br></p>

            <p>Well, I can sort of see where Ellipsis is coming from with Lola. This is what I got from her:<br>She&#39;s a loud nerd, speaks multiple languages, wears clothing that might be described as a bit gothic, and can use a muggle-use wand AND a paper-knife.<br><br>Where did she learn so many languages? Why would a spazzy fan girl learn how to use a knife or a muggle use wand?<br><br>See, these things raise Sue alarms. I can see where you&#39;re coming from though, and I think if you toned her down a bit, it might work.<br>Maybe she could be a former badfic writer? She could have written a Harry Potter badfic, got sent to the Harry Potter Fanfic Academy (Yes, you can say an OC went there without actually having been apart of it), learned of the PPC, and wanted to make up for her past mistakes. She could have learned where to use a muggle-use wand there.<br>As for flaws, the constant talking and being so opinionated could make her a bit of a fanbrat, which would be interesting to see as an agent.<br><br>As for Skelter, he seems like he would work, but I don&#39;t recommend having two really fanboy/girlish agents in a pair, unless they&#39;re fans of different canons. Both of them are fans of Doctor Who, which would be trouble if they were assigned a mission there. Skelter might try to glomp the Doctor, while Lola might try to join in. I recommend giving one of the pair some restraint when dealing with LOs.<br><br>I see potential, they just need a bit more work.<br><br></p>

            <p>I actually am autistic.

Well... after sleeping on it, I *did* come up with an alternate backstory for Skelter... He used to be a completely human Agent, no zombiness at all, when on a particularly bad mission to the L4D continuum, BOOM, he got Infected. Now, they brought him back and got him to Medical right away, but he&#39;d already started to turn. Sufficiently Advanced Technology let him keep some of his mind, but... Physically, he&#39;s screwed.<br><br>Hmmm... Perhaps, especially when the Doctor is concerned, Lola has had enough No-Drool videos to last a lifetime? Easily squicked, remember?

            <p>EF and SS:<br><br>First of all, I&#39;m really, really not sure why you&#39;re picking on the Muggle-use wand and a paper-knife as weapons. The <i>whole point</i> of the Muggle-use wand is that anyone can use it. They&#39;re handed out to the fanlings who go to OFUM, and they&#39;re available in HQ for agents going into Potterverse missions. They&#39;re not hard to use. And... it&#39;s a paper-knife. It&#39;s not exactly the most effective weapon known to man, and I kinda thought that was the point. Imagine trying to fight off a warrior!Sue with a letter-opener! Also, anyone can get one of those out of a mail-order catalog, so they&#39;re not exactly rare and wondrous mystical Sue items.<br><br>Aside from that, where else are these alleged sparkles coming from? SS, you mentioned speaking multiple languages. Okay, maybe some clarification is needed there: how many languages, which ones, and how fluent is she? But I don&#39;t see anything else that screams &quot;Sue&quot; to me, and a single exaggerated characteristic does not a Sue make. The remaining points in your summary are being &quot;a loud nerd&quot; who wears &quot;clothing that might be described as a bit gothic.&quot; You&#39;ll need to explain how those are Sueish traits, or else explain why you chose to list them as such, because I don&#39;t get it.<br><br>Also, EF, please explain how Skelter is &quot;only a bit better&quot; and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jack">Jack</a> is okay. Or were you unaware of Jack? There might be something in questioning Skelter&#39;s originality, but if you&#39;re going to make an issue of the concept, you might want to notify PitViperOfDoom, since she did it first.<br><br>Finally, I feel a point of clarification is necessary: fangirl does not equal Sue. The bubbliest, squeeingest, glompingest fanthing is still a perfectly legitimate agent concept, provided the author realizes that the character&#39;s attitude is likely to go over like a lead balloon with most other agents. This then creates conflict, and conflict is good. Conflict leads to humor, character growth, and all sorts of other things.<br><br>That said, there&#39;s one point I do agree with, and that&#39;s that it might not be a good idea to have two characters like this as a pair unless they have very different interests. While someone losing control during a mission (and getting in trouble for it!) is funny maybe once or twice, it shouldn&#39;t happen all the time, or the pair is incompetent.<br><br>TL;DR - nitpicking much?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s mostly a matter of how well it&#39;s executed.<br><br>Skelter could be an in-name-only zombie (since most of the description went into his fanboyishness) or a well-rounded character whose state strongly affects how he interacts with people.<br><br>About Lola, there wasn&#39;t really any context, or backstory, about how she got to these skills, if she started out as being AnnaBee. The OFU sounds like a good idea, but out of nowhere, it&#39;s a bit out of nowhere. Another thing is that bubbly, hyper personality is seen in Sues from time to time, and this too, is highly depending on how it&#39;s executed and how other characters react to it.<br><br>Just wanted to make sure these points were, well, pointed out and that AnnaBee&#39;s aware of them. Knowing is half the battle, as it says, and the root to writing a good character is to take their characteristics and run with them. To the very end. And back.</p>

            <p>See also my responses below, but if the issues are potential execution and lack of context, then the appropriate response would be to ask questions about how these things would be executed and about their context, yes?

            <p>I was under the impression that Muggle-use wands were, well, wands that could be used by muggles.

            <p>Let me see if I can explain why it came off that way. Part of it is that both you and EF touched on some of the same things, which made it seem like sort of a joint assault on what looked like pretty small details to me. Also, you both jumped straight to questioning the existence and/or quality of character details, rather than asking questions about them, if that makes sense. Not, &quot;If she has a Muggle-use wand, did she go to HFA?&quot; but rather, &quot;How is it possible that someone like her could have this thing?&quot; It&#39;s the &quot;someone like her&quot; qualifier that&#39;s problematic. To quote your actual words, troublesome qualifiers highlighted:<br><br>EF: She can, <font color="blue">for <s>somerising</s> some reason</font>, use a Muggle use wand.<br><br>Apparently this agent&#39;s ability to use a Muggle-use wand is in question. How come she needs a special reason? Do other agents need a reason, or just this one?<br><br>SS: Why would <font color="blue">a spazzy fan girl</font> learn how to use a knife or a muggle use wand?<br><br>Again, it seems the real issue is that this character is a spazzy fangirl, and spazzy fangirls need to justify having an interest in using this type of equipment. Does anyone else need to?<br><br>If Muggle-use wands were overpowered, or rare, or otherwise inappropriate in and of themselves, that should be problematic for any agent, not just one with Lola&#39;s traits. Same with the letter-opener, the languages, etc. These details are not actually the problem in and of themselves, but by questioning them in this way, you&#39;re casting doubt on the entire character. Poking at small things in order to get at a larger problem is nitpicking; the trouble here is that neither the details nor the bigger thing (the whole character concept) are actually problematic once explained. Which comes off badly.<br><br>I&#39;m not at all sure I&#39;ve explained this very well. Let me know if I&#39;m not making sense.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You rule. Seriously. <br><br>Okay. Clarification-wise: <br><br>THIS AGENT IS ME. I believe Phobos suggested that next time I run an agent, I use myself. So, I decided to run myself and an OC of mine. <br><br>The whole point of the Muggle-use wand and the letter-opener is that they&#39;re weapons I could see myself using. I could NEVER use a broadsword or a longbow. Heck, I&#39;m not sure I could even use a gun! I KNOW how to use a wand, though, and the letter opener is for continuua where the wand isn&#39;t allowed. &gt;.&gt; Plus... if I remember right, don&#39;t Muggle-Use wands only have a few spells loaded into them?<br><br>Languages-wise: French, Japanese, Latin, and a wee bit of German and Chinese. Fluency level: High for French, though my spoken French is rotten and ungrammatical. Moderate for Latin, though Eru help her if she ever runs into, say, Romans.

            <p>The HFA ones (<i>HFA</i>, not OFUM, what is wrong with me) only have the five spells, yeah. Unless you also count the ability to shoot sparks, I guess.

            <p>Lola sparkles. I can see where you wanted to go with her, but she&#39;s less &quot;you,&quot; and more &quot;you, just better.&quot; She can, for <strike>somerising</strike> some reason, use a Muggle use wand. Where did she learn that? And she has a neat little Gandalf sword thing... are you sure you can fight with a paper knife?<br>The only negative trait I see is that she has a tendency to be annoying.<br><br>Skelter is... only a bit better.

            <p>Does she really sparkle? Really? Spammit. :( I tried not to make her sparkle too much. <br><br>I was thinking she&#39;d been at the PPC for a bit, and possibly also a stint at the Harry Potter fanfiction academy. *Has written some bad Potterverse fanfic, soooo...* Of course I can get rid of it.<br><br>Problem with me-as-agent is that I can&#39;t fight at all, so... I can replace her weapons with something more conventional. <br><br>And negative traits, I have those in abundance. Arrogant, pig-headed, a bit of a show-off... *just realizes she failed to put those in the description, and facepalmeth* <br><br>As for Skel... I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s one of those Agents who fell through a plot hole. If they don&#39;t work, I can easily go back to Vernet and Mundar, I just... like these two better.</p>

            <p>Which is actually still kinda funny, &#39;cause of that TONGUE. Some people lick their lips- Skelter&#39;s got the awkward tic of licking his WHOLE DARN FACE.<br><br>He&#39;s also a massive fanboy- I mean MASSIVE- to the point where he&#39;d ALMOST rather find a comic book shop than a survivor camp, massive. He&#39;s twitchy, ADD, impulsive,  oddly cheerful, spastic, a Wolverine fanboy, a HUGE Whovian, fond of making daft puns and nicknaming everyone after superheroes, socially inept, manic to the point of borderline insanity-<br><br>And yes, he&#39;s a walking- no, a LURCHING- rotting, boil-covered corpse with a multi-foot-long tongue, homicidal urges, and a habit of making disgusting choking noises to communicate. Due to his mehfic of origin, he retained some level of sapience. Thanks to Sufficiently Advanced Technology, he is no longer contagious and he is equipped with a translator so people who AREN&#39;T the walking dead can understand him. <br><br>Basically, he&#39;s your average nerdy comic book fanboy, stuck in a Smoker&#39;s body, with ALL the limitations that pertain to it. Including being generally nasty, and not understanding why it grosses people out; occasionally seeing big, juicy steaks where people should be; and an urge to get up in high places, grab people with his tongue, and eat them. <br><br>And since my other agent is basically me... she&#39;s had to get, um, &#39;tolerant&#39; fast. More on that later.</p>

            <p>We&#39;re playing using Woolsley&#39;s Unabridged, 15th edition rules. Anyone can join in!<br><br>Get your <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QoP60zZiLFI/TbWdTPIYOBI/AAAAAAAAA2A/5NhMHP-SRzo/s1600/London_underground_map.jpg">maps</a> ready and try to remember which stations you possess and which belong to other people, though another player will be quick to remind you if you&#39;re breaking the rules. Keep in mind that since this is the 2005 edition, <b>Heathrow Terminal 4 is not accessible for any reason.</b> You cannot take Mornington Crescent until you are in State. We&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t start on the Northern Line, but if you do the house rule is that Euston and Camden Town are blocked for two turns. Players on the Victoria line may pass through Euston, but cannot stop or switch lines there for any reason while this is in effect.<br><br>Let&#39;s get cracking, shall we?<br><br>I&#39;ll be starting in <b>Upminster.</b></p>

            <p>Time for the Shinjuku Switcheroo, as of course popularised by Sawaguchi in the &#39;88 Tokyo finals.

            <p><a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/r/7386853/">This</a> is also not how we handle badfic reporting.<br><br>If you&#39;d bothered to read the FAQs while &quot;spending lots of time on the wiki,&quot; you&#39;d know that telling an author you&#39;re reporting their story to the PPC is generally frowned upon, because it generally only causes drama for us.<br><br>Also, something you seem to be misunderstanding. Whether through a lack of reading comprehension or just grossly missing the point, I&#39;m not sure. <i><b>We are not the fandom police.</b></i> We are comedians. We are humor writers. We are satirists. That seems to be something quite a few newbies have a problem understanding, actually. We don&#39;t go after badfic just because it&#39;s bad. We go after badfic that can be turned into something funny. Before you blindly report badfic, read over it. Stop, and think &quot;Can this be turned into something funny? Does this have humor potential? Do I know any members who might be interested in tackling it?&quot; If so, go ahead. Add it to the unclaimed badfic list on the wiki, and if you want, find an already-existing badfic thread on the board, and mention it there. If not, please, don&#39;t bother. There&#39;s enough badfic out there being reported already that we don&#39;t need more.<br><br>And by the blood on Verra&#39;s floor, <i>don&#39;t</i> go tell the authors. It&#39;s fine to leave concrit, if you think they&#39;ll take it, but avoid mentioning the PPC. Please.</p>

            <p>At the risk of falling into the poisoned well here, being technically part of &quot;everyone else,&quot; but July, Data, SeaTurtle, and hS were all right to make the points they did to SadeG, IMO—and hS to July, too. It&#39;s kind of an obligation for members of the community to correct other members when they make mistakes. We don&#39;t all have a gift for making our Internet voice sound like candy and puppies when doing so, but that doesn&#39;t mean they were &quot;bad&quot; for speaking up. Also, this is probably why there&#39;s a line in the Constitution warning about our barks being worse than our bites, and also a bit about not assuming people are jumping down your throat (which SadeG seems to do, given all the apologies), yes?<br><br>In other words: let&#39;s please not call names and use broad categories that include people who aren&#39;t even directly involved yet, okay?<br><br>~Neshomeh, who hopes this post sounds like kittens, at least.</p>

            <p>... that (<i>I am not here to be given badfic, slot it into a word processor, and crank it out into a mission for you.</i>) is a hilarious thought that I would pay good pixels to see.<br><br>July: I don&#39;t see anything to suggest SadeG (who I will forever think of as SadEgg due to me being weird) wanted you to create missions from those &#39;fics.

EggNog, listen to what July says, for she is the servant of the Greater Demon Wikia, and knows many things. Both of you, look up at the ceiling and shout hurrah! for <b>He Is Awake</b>.<br><br>... wait, did I say hurrah or horror?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Is that going &quot;Do we have people who do missions in X?&quot; and then upon being shown how to find if there are missions in X, and then not responding with &quot;Oh, gee, I see now, thanks,&quot; or anything that indicates that yes, they are aware there are missions in X and done by Y people, but with badfic instead of any actual suggestion that they actually found out the answer to their question kinda makes me suspect they just wanted to know so they can slot badfic into people to do missions for them. Answering as they were didn&#39;t actually tell me anything beyond they find badfic, definitively. <br><br>And no, the wiki is not perfect, but Neshomeh and I (mostly Neshomeh at the moment, since this is her pet project) are trying to make it be as complete as possible in terms of listing missions and agents where appropriate. It might be missing some information, but things like that- especially when they have more than one mission or agent from the continuum in question- are dealt with to ensure that the wiki is useful. It is very saddening when people don&#39;t bother to use the wiki when a good deal of answers can be found there.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve started trying to come up with/write up my Agent/s, and I&#39;m running into issues.  I tried a couple days ago, but made a complete botch of it; I ended up with horribly un-PPC Agents which a pair of Boarders thankfully shot down.  Does anyone have some general How-to-Write-Agents-for-Idiots style tips?  Don&#39;t be shy, now - I can use all the help I can get.<br><br>(And I know it&#39;s way too early for me to even think about getting Permission.

            <p>Okay, I&#39;m not sure if my method will work for you, but here&#39;s what I did:<br><br>When I first posted on the board I was concerned about my-how should I put this?- my self-insert of the stories that happen in my head. I was worried that she was a total Sue, but I had been thinking up stuff that involved her for years.<br><br>Originally, I was going to have her be one of my agents. I think at the time I had this idea of integrating my head canon with the PPC canon. Looking back on it now, this would have backfired HORRIBLY, so thank whatever deity that this idea never made it out of my head.<br><br>After being comforted by some other boarders about my self insert, and after a few days, I started thinking up new adventures. These adventures were of missions that I might go on and two of my OCs from other stories I had in my head slipped in.<br><br>I certainly wasn&#39;t going to have those two OCs be my agents in their present state, so they sort of changed on their own. I based them not only off of those two OCs, but off me. Natasha was the more nervous, self-doubting side of me, which actually worked pretty well with what her character was originally; while Sylvia was me during the rare times where I felt like a bada**. This also seemed to fit her, as she was not only my OC, but also my Fallout 3 PC.<br><br>I started pretending to be these characters whenever I dreamed up what might happen on missions, and that seemed to work pretty well. I&#39;m not sure if it would work with you, but it&#39;s worth giving it a shot.<br><br>So, in conclusion, try to let it come naturally. Go do something! Play a game, go out for a walk! When you see someone, like a non-consequential NPC or something, think of why they might be there, and what they might be like. Maybe you&#39;ll get an idea!<br><br>Or maybe I&#39;m just making stuff up. I really don&#39;t know anymore.<br></p>

            <p>I just think that keeping the old name makes it easier to keep the character from growing.  If they stop growing, they stagnate.  No one wants a stagnant agent; they tend to smell bad.</p>

            <p>First suggestion: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:For_Newbies">Read this</a>.<br><br>Second suggestion: Write yourself as an agent. Write yourself as being a <i>new</i> agent. I&#39;m a bit unsure as to why there was a move away from this, because overall it lends to more than a few things, such as the fact that you&#39;re immediately able to get into the swing with yourself rather than making an agent especially for the PPC and thus ~*~perfected~*~ for being an agent, and two, it lends credence to when you&#39;re writing your first missions and you have no idea what you are doing. Because, believe me, you don&#39;t. <br><br>I read all the missions and every bit of supplementary information out there when I was new and I <i>still</i> had no idea what I was doing when I started my first mission.  Is this funny? Is that funny? Am I doing this right? Can I do this to her? Is it okay if I break all these things terribly? What the hell is even going on here? Oh God, help, I think I just lost where the Sue is? <br><br>But it was okay, because I worked that in with my agents, because they didn&#39;t know what they were doing either! <br><br>That doesn&#39;t work out so well when your agent has been around for over five years, is a tough and hardened veteran of the Sue Invasion of &#39;08, carved a macrovirus off their partner&#39;s face, was around for Crashing Down and Reorganisation and so on...+ (It is easier to blame the goofs on your agent not knowing what they&#39;re doing- and it&#39;s funnier- than if it&#39;s an agent that should know what they&#39;re doing. Cluelessness is funny. Incompetence at a certain point is just sad. Especially when they&#39;re being touted and held up as being a pro.)<br><br>Beyond that, remember, you are working not with two individual characters, but with a <i>pair</i> (usually). Agents working in pairs allows for dynamism during a mission. Depending on which Flower paired them up it could be because they balance each other in such a way that they&#39;re able to perform their duties, it ensures that agents are learning from each other in ways that will improve their future performance, or because it&#39;s a mean and sadistic move making two people have to work together even though they drive each other up the wall.^ It allows for actual character interaction. After all, one agent by themself? What if their weak spots are involved? If one agent is able to keep calm and carry on, and the other can&#39;t at a particular spot of the fic, it gives us something to enjoy beyond just the sporking, and serves as reminding us that they are balanced.<br><br>Next item. We enjoy humor here. We also have an eye towards serious stuff at times as well. That said? Your agents should be characters in their own right. They shouldn&#39;t be made up perfect for just the PPC. They should be able to function elsewhere. In theory. Why? Because a good character is more complicated than shouting out random things just because, or being able to shoot a Sue with a clever wittism. They need to be <i>interesting</i>. At the same time, it&#39;s about knowing what you are able to write- and you need to have an eye for both. <br><br>Know what sort of humor you&#39;re going to go for. Know what sort of jokes you like that you are able to write well. What sort of humor is your character able to provide? If it&#39;s dead baby jokes (&quot;Your baby was crawling all over the place!&quot; &quot;Oh dear, I&#39;m so sorry, were you able to get her to sleep, at least?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s okay, I nailed her to her bed! She&#39;s not moving anywhere!&quot;) they probably won&#39;t work out too well.* If it&#39;s running around being random (Screaming &quot;POTATO! POTATO!&quot; constantly for no real reason beyond thinking that &#39;potato&#39; is a funny word°) that also might not work out. Don&#39;t forget, timing is everything, too. A joke can quickly become awful and inappropriate if it&#39;s given at the wrong spot. If your character doesn&#39;t actually have comedic timing, that can turn bad really quickly. Knowing how to write something that is really, well and truly funny is important for the PPC. <br><br>Know what&#39;s creepy. And then? Avoid it. It&#39;s not funny. It&#39;s not anything beyond severely discomfiting to people. The guy who stares at all the female agents&#39; boobs and molests unconscious female canons when they&#39;re knocked out or out of it because hey, he has a neuralyzer? That&#39;s creepy. That&#39;s not appropriate. That should make you feel icky just thinking about it.<br><br>Know how they&#39;re able to be serious. What do they get serious about? How do they act? Will they be serious all the time in a place like the PPC? If they are, it&#39;s not much of a problem- if they&#39;re paired with someone who will be cheerful about doing their job and enjoys it and has no problem being an annoyance to their stuck-in-the-mud partner. Otherwise, you might need to reconsider. Are they mostly level headed? What makes them go into a panic, then? What makes them angry and forget about trying to be reasonable? What makes them dissolve into laughter for several minutes? And if they&#39;re constantly being chipper and happy and constantly making jokes or having fun, what makes them stop laughing? What makes the smile drop from their face? What gets them to act serious?++<br><br>Do they have any tales of dark, terrible woe behind them? You might have to reconsider it.<sup>^</sup> The PPC is a hard place, in its ways. I mean, we&#39;re talking about a place where you&#39;re fighting things that are out to destroy worlds on a day to day basis! Missions fail! People die! It&#39;s a job that drives people insane! You get no pay, no recompense beyond knowing you&#39;re doing a job that <i>helps</i> the multiverse. You need to be able to grin and have a laugh- at something, anything. Missions aren&#39;t fun to read, point blank, if it&#39;s as dark as dark. Existential angst isn&#39;t a good idea. Suicide (no, not him) doesn&#39;t really have a place here, unless it&#39;s played for a laugh, and I&#39;m not going to go into the details as to why that can be a bad idea. Abuse doesn&#39;t belong here. Sexual harassment. Rape. These things go along with the PPC itself- not the missions- about as well as jet fuel and your liver do. There are ways to involve these things, of course, because with competent writing anything is possible, but for the most part, you- this is a general you- aren&#39;t able to play it off. The moments where these things are appropriate to bring up are rare, and should be kept rare.  (Please note: This paragraph is with regards to these subjects in the PPC itself, rather than as part of mission material. There is a difference between what the PPC has, and what the contents of the badfic we deal with has, and how it is dealt with.)<br><br>In short, keep it simple. Write who you know (which is usually you). Write to your knowledge level (you don&#39;t know what it is and how to deal with it in a good way until you&#39;ve worked with it yourself, because you write different from everyone else!). Know how you are going to approach things- a character that makes rape jokes probably shouldn&#39;t be in the PPC. Nor should one that has a terrible awful past that she can&#39;t help but bring up all the time. They also need to have the capability to be serious (because sometimes, it is necessary.) <br><br><br>+This is a Stu. Or a Sue. Yes, as an agent. In the PPC. And not reformed. <br>^ Frequently thought of being the rationale of the Sunflower Official, the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace, and the Marquis de Sod, in that order.<br>*Please don&#39;t actually use dead baby jokes. <br>°If your counterpoint that random humor is funny is Monty Python or Invader Zim, please hold off. Monty Python is not &#39;random&#39; humor, but a form of surrealism. Surrealism&#39;s base is from the unexpected happening or things showing a disconnect from actual reality. In Invader Zim, Gir spouting off all that stuff isn&#39;t showing him as being funny, but to show that he&#39;s stupid. The characters that are shown to be mostly intelligent do not find Gir funny.<br>++ The ability to be serious is as important as having a sense of humor. The ability to be serious shows the understanding that certain things need to be handled with more than a laugh.<br><sup>^</sup> Characters with tales of dark, terrible woe are often Sues or Stus. </p>

            <p>Start out by fleshing out their character: who are they? How did they get to the PPC? What&#39;s their motivation for staying with a bunch of crazy agents? What do they want in life? Do they have long-term goals they wish to achieve? How do they react faced with illogic/squick/anything the Ironic Overpower throws at them? Etc, etc.<br><br>Once you&#39;ve fleshed each individual out, ask yourself: how are they going to react with one another? Will they clash constantly? Is one a senior agent teaching a rookie how to survive? Etc, etc. <br><br>Making agents aliens or natives of some other continua is perfectly acceptable, but make sure that if they have special powers or abilities that they are not &quot;game-breaking&quot;. Just imagine how boring a mission would be if a Time Lord and Jedi pair simply waltz into a fic with a TARDIS and zap a Sue to death all while complaining about the writing. That would reek of Sueish agents too, for that matter. <br><br>Keep their powers in check: I have a prototype Floater agent who is a protoss high templar, a member of a race of incredibly powerful long-lived autotrophic psychics from the StarCraft verse. Since he is no longer in his home continuum, he suffers from being cut off from the protoss collective. His psionic powers are therefore greatly weakened and he cannot cast any powerful spells without killing himself due to uncontrolled energy surges. <br><br>For added points you could also crack jokes concerning alien biology: the same protoss agent lacks a mouth since he is an autotrophic telepath. Imagine what would happen if he is disguised as a human and he eats a cinnamon bun (<i>*cough* Animorphs *cough*</i>) or he tries to speak aloud. </p>

            <p>Well, have you found any badfic with recruitable characters? I have two agents planned like this. Is there a race/job in one of your fandoms that you think you&#39;d like to write (like my agents, Lana, Narav, and Tera.) You could also make the agent a normal person, a nerd who got hired by the PPC as if it was a normal job, or an OFU graduate who, say, can&#39;t handle going back to &#39;normality&#39; after meeting and learning from her favorite characters.</p>

            <p>Well, not necessarily. You could say that their home fic was already sporked, and then go back later and write that mission, or they could&#39;ve fallen through a plothole.

            <p>Homura made it without falling into despair, Madoka destroyed every witch that would ever exist in the past, present, or future, and the world went from a place where all Puella Magi are doomed to become hellish monsters to one where they all get to go to essentially-heaven.

            <p>Then may I please recommend Kaname Madoka and the Sankt Kaiser? Here&#39;s a  basis of each one:<br><br>Sankt Kaiser: In Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha history, there used to be warring empires, spread throughout the universe. These empires had a habit of creating reality-warping artifacts with which to fight this war, and also turning their rulers into weapons themselves. The last leader of the nation Belka, Olivie Segbrecht,  was one of the most powerful of these. She ended up sacrificing herself to end the war, and so was deified. <br><br><br>Kaname Madoka: From Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a deconstruction/reconstruction of the magical girl genre, where girls make contracts with this being called Kyubey: they get one wish, and in return for that, they get a jewel called a Soul Gem that lets them use magic, and they have to fight monsters called witches. What they don&#39;t know at first is that a) the Soul Gem is literally their soul, ripped out of their bodies, and if they get more than 100 meters away from it they won&#39;t be able to use their bodies (which will become comatose) or if the gem breaks, they will die. b) As they use magic/feel negative emotions, the gem darkens, and if the gem darkens completely, then they will become witches. <br><br>Madoka wished to stop every witch everywhere, and so takes away the magical girls, before they become witches, to her heaven in another world. In the words of Tomoe Mami &quot;You&#39;re not just bringing hope. You&#39;re becoming hope itself--the hope for all of us.&quot; This had the side effect of making her cease to exist as a person, and so she is everywhere and everywhen, but unable to interact with anyone.  Of course, any Puella Magi agents would find this out, and therefore would might want to worship her.<br><br><br>Hm, that ended up being kinda long. Oh well, my agent Ari already worships the Sankt Kaiser, and I have plans for Puella Magi agents, who would definitely worship Madoka.</p>

            <p>Huh, cool. I&#39;ll definitely use this in one of my missions. Just one minor thingie:<br><br>The Church of the Saint Kaiser is the only mentioned religion in Nanoha, oddly enough, and is big enough to have its own troops, hospitals, and its leaders are occasionally government personnel (Apparently Mid-Childa has not heard of &#39;seperation of church and state.&#39;) My point was that there isn&#39;t much religion shown canonically outside of Saint-King-ism. Plus, that whole giant war thing that she sacrificed herself to end kinda ended up with all of them being mostly wiped out, apart from the isolated descendant-with-genetic memories, cloned-to-run-a-giant-spaceship, reawakened-to-bring-a-zombie-army cases. So, it&#39;s unlikely that anyone would deface the little shrine. <br></p>

            <p>Hmm. Well, let&#39;s see. We almost never see the Saint King herself (Olivie) and the only picture that shows up and is official is this painting of her in a dress:  <br><br><img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091114233943/nanoha/images/c/c9/Olivie.png" alt="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091114233943/nanoha/images/c/c9/Olivie.png"><br><br>I couldn&#39;t find any pictures of a particular symbol they used, so a statue of Olivie would probably be more likely, but she would possibly be in her armor. Going by Vivio, her clone&#39;s, armor, it might look something like this: <br><br><img src="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110319074261/nanoha/images/thumb/8/80/ImpactCannon.png/830px-ImpactCannon.png" alt="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110319074261/nanoha/images/thumb/8/80/ImpactCannon.png/830px-ImpactCannon.png"><br><br><img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110319065305/nanoha/images/thumb/2/28/PlasmaArm.png/830px-PlasmaArm.png" alt="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110319065305/nanoha/images/thumb/2/28/PlasmaArm.png/830px-PlasmaArm.png"><br><br>But it might also look like very pretty armor. The statue would probably wear a small-ish crown, but I&#39;m guessing here--Olivie&#39;s life has not been touched on very much in the manga, since the main plot is the magical-combat tournament.</p>

            <p>She&#39;s everywhere and everywhen, but people can&#39;t see or hear her (with maybe the partial exception of Homura, as hinted in the epilogue). And she&#39;s around in the PPC too, since she follows Puella Magi Agents too. (yeah, she&#39;s on the &quot;Canon character who know about the PPC&quot; list. And if she isn&#39;t, is going to be added.<br><br>The fact is, PPC Agents are <i>meta</i>. They can see things that canons can&#39;t.<br><br>So, are we going to assume that Madoka will start to hang out in the PPC, since with them (and only them) she actually <i>can</i> interact?</p>

            <p>Well, she still doesn&#39;t have a physical body, so I doubt she&#39;d be hanging around in a visible sort of way, but I could see her commenting occasionally. Probably not all that often, though, since as she herself pointed out, she&#39;s got the entire history of the world and every Puella who ever lived to keep her company. ;)</p>

            <p>Yes, she would probably be there, but not interact; you won&#39;t see Ultimate Madoka sitting down to have tea with the SO. But any Puella Magi agents who fall into despair will be visited by her,  and no one will be able to interact with her, unless they&#39;ve got some kind of Sight/psychic ability/wish somewhat related to being able to see her. Perhaps if she appears to a PPC Puella Magi, then they will be able to talk to her for the time it takes for her to save said dying Magi. <br><br>Also, not even every Puella: Every single living creature ever. </p>

            <p>Wait, decommission who? Sergio or Kyubey? Also, he won&#39;t force you into a contract, just keep hanging around you (which he can&#39;t do outside of his home &#39;verse) or wait for something bad to happen (such as Mami&#39;s car crash or when Sayaka or Madoka are about to get killed).<br><br>Also, I assumed that Kyubey can be neuralyzed, for a few reasons: One, the main problem with hive-minds is that the knowledge can get spread around to everywhere else (though, didn&#39;t we have to neuralyze a Borg once?) but Kyubey has a mind seperate from the other members of his race--he doesn&#39;t know what an Incubator running around in America thinks unless that Incubator tells him. So, if you manage to neuralyze him almost immediately, he should be able to forget it... I hope. </p>

            <p>Oh, I see. I&#39;d actually be really really surprised, yet somehow not, to see a Belkan Sue, considering that all this went down several centuries beforehand, and the Saint Kaiser is almost a Sue in herself, being the best combat mage, the kindest person, the most beautiful person--although, considering that she&#39;s been dead and a lot of that is either a) exaggerated by her worshippers or b) described by the descendant with the memories of the Saint King&#39;s boyfriend-prince. <br><br>Anyways, there could be some kind of controversy whether it had a statue of the Saint King herself, or her six-year-old clone, and whether said clone&#39;s mothers (yes, plural.) should be on there, or whatever. </p>

            <p>The point was, a Sue in that time period would be strange because that time is almost never written about in canon, so almost nothing is known. But on the other hand, it has superpowerful royals who would be controlled by their nation, and it is a trait of Suethors that they can villify pure and kind people. Well, should one of those fics pop up, I would definitely mission it. </p>

            <p>...which is what I thought s/he meant. The ending of ME3 made a lot of people angry because they thought it was badly-executed/a cop-out/left too many loose ends/made no sense/whatever, but the basic events <i>are</i> rather similar- the protagonist merges their mind with a much larger force to eliminate the threat posed by the infringing monsters/antagonists. It&#39;s just that where PMMM tied up all the loose ends and caused all sorts of feels, ME3... did not handle it as well.<br><br>Anyway, shutting up now.</p>

            <p>This is... actually remarkably convenient. I&#39;ve had plans for a Puella Magi and a Majo Shoujo (yes, I am perfectly aware that that may not be real Japanese. The CAD in that particular story thought it had a sense of humor)pair of agents who worship Kaname Madoka, Concept of Hope, savior of the Puella Magi. My original plan was for one of them to have three Madoka Figmas in Her three forms set up in a little shrine, but this new temple thing works really well, too.</p>

            <p>In fact, it can also have some fun potential, such as her getting weird looks for those not into Madokaism.<br>I&#39;m thinking about making Nikki a Madokaist too, and Agent!Sergio will surely replace &quot;for Haruhi&#39;s sake&quot; (used exactly once. He&#39;s not into calling gods, but he was in a falling plane at the time) and similars with &quot;for Madoka&#39;s sake&quot; and similars.<br><br>Expecially since calling out Haruhi was nothimg more than a shout out, while Madoka&#39;s actually got all of his respect.<br>The one he respects the most is Homura, though. They have a lot in common.<br><br>(By the way, the shrine I was after in my previous post was Madoka&#39;s. Probably a conseguence of the fact I rewatched the last episode today, as it was being aired this morning in Italian for the first time.)</p>

No, it&#39;s not a bad thing to not like fanworks, however, be aware that the main thing agents do is go into bad fanfiction and fix things.
