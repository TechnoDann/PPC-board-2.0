            <p>I liked how you played with the changing fic formats and had them affect Florestan.  That was definitely a unique problem to this fic, and it&#39;s good that you focused on that.  (It might have been fun to have <i>both</i> the agents get sick from it, to underscore how bad the shifting was.)<br><br>But speaking of Florestan&#39;s reactions, you have him getting angry frequently here, and a lot of the time I don&#39;t really understand why.  He keeps reacting to the fic quotes we see by calling them stupid, but it&#39;s better to show the audience <i>why</i> Florestan finds them stupid, rather than just labeling them as such.  This is especially important in a chaotic crossover like this one, where it&#39;s pretty much guaranteed your audience won&#39;t understand at least one of the continua involved.  You did do this well with Viper, explaining how her fic-given backstory completely contradicted her canon one.  But something like Tails being an orphan with no family is something not everyone would know.<br><br>Also, you&#39;ve made a mini-Darkside in your charge list: it&#39;s Organization XIII, not Organization 13.  (Another fun thing you could have touched on:  only Nobodies are part of the Organization.  Is the replacement!Tails in this fic a Nobody?)</p>

            <p>First off, I really like how you handled the shifts from prose to script and back.  Good job on that.<br><br>I have to say, however, that I did not really like the mission.  There were several problems:<br><br>1) Almost everyone is a character replacement.  While I agree that Tails definitely was a replacement, there was no evidence that Sephiroth was, except for the CAD saying it.  Viper&#39;s altered backstory was also not enough to make her a replacement, in my opinion.  I don&#39;t know about Shifu, as I am not familiar with the character, but I would guess that he was also not a replacement, just very out of character.<br><br>A replacement has to have more than just superficial changes.  Like Tails.  He had uncanonical powers, was out of his world, answered to his given name (which, I seem to recall, he hates) rather than his preferred nickname, and bore no resemblance to his original characterization.  He was a replacement.<br><br>1.5) Why kill three replacements, but neuralyze the fourth?  Whatever the method, keep it consistent.<br><br>2) Some of your grammar is off.  For instance &quot;When the shift ended, Florestan found himself leaning against a nearby house as he shook his head.&quot;  That is a very awkward sentence.  We don&#39;t need to be told that the house is nearby; it would have to be if he is leaning on it.  How is it that he found himself doing these things?  Did he not know that he had leaned against a house?  It would be better written as &quot;When the shift ended, Florestan leaned against a house and shook his head.&quot;<br><br>This is not the only example, it is just the one that came most readily to mind.<br><br>2.5) Never use the term &quot;soon after&quot; ever again, please.  You are trying too hard to tell us the order of events, when the narrative already does that for you.  &quot;He opened the bottle and took a swig of the Bleepto-dismal soon after.&quot;  That is a clear example.  The order of events is clear from the sentence, making the &quot;soon after&quot; redundant.<br><br>Also, you used &quot;soon after&quot; eight times in thirteen pages.  That includes where you used it twice in one sentence.  &quot;Both agents closed their eyes soon after, with Florestan activating the neuralyzer soon after.&quot;<br><br>3) The assassination was anti-climactic.  It just kind of happened.  Tails stood there while they read the charges, Eusabius pulls out the pikestaff, and then Tails is dead.  Why didn&#39;t he fight back?  He has shown that he is not afraid to kill people without a second thought.  I think that this was a major missed opportunity.<br><br>4) That&#39;s it for my specific notes on problems.<br><br>Like I said earlier, the way you handled the shifts was excellent.  I would also add that you did a good job of explaining why Viper&#39;s new backstory was so wrong.  I don&#39;t know anything about <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>, so I had no way of knowing that they had completely reversed her backstory.  I didn&#39;t feel lost at all in regards to what was happening in that continuum.<br><br>If you want to talk in-depth about anything that I&#39;ve mentioned, you can feel free to email me at the address listed on my <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User%3APhobos7">Wiki page.</a><br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>So I went back and took out all the soon afters and stuff.<br><br>As for some of my stuff.<br><br>1) Viper&#39;s being a replacement is actually backed up by stuff that was revealed about this fic&#39;s version of her backstory after the point I stopped at (where it was revealed that a) she somehow knew who Tails was and that b) they had both been stuck playing something called &quot;The Game&quot;, which I assume is something from a continuum I don&#39;t know). Also, she&#39;s wangsting when we first see her: Viper doesn&#39;t wangst. Ever. She&#39;s fierce, independent, and extremely courageous (as shown in both the first movie and the canon short film <i>Secrets of the Furious Five</i>), so wangsting would be completely OOC for her. Knowing her, she&#39;d do her best to rise above it. (It also doesn&#39;t help that her in-fic backstory completely contradicts the canon information that <i>Viper&#39;s first instance of courage was fighting some people who were seriously injuring her father</i>.)<br><br>And trust me, Shifu is <i>completely</i> out of character, so much that he couldn&#39;t see his canon self with a pair of binoculars. Compare the way he is in-fic with these two clips from the two movies: <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJiu2VSYShY&amp;feature=related"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJiu2VSYShY&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJiu2VSYShY&amp;amp;feature=related</a></a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Og8K81M6E&amp;feature=related"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Og8K81M6E&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Og8K81M6E&amp;amp;feature=related</a></a><br><br>As per your suggestion, though, I ended up changing that small bit about Sephiroth, so...<br><br>1.5) D&#39;oh! That was an oversight on my part. Dang it, I didn&#39;t even realize that I had an inconsistency there! Ugh, and I&#39;m usually better about finding those things, too... *facedesks*<br><br>2) So in other words, avoid narrative redundances. Okay: I&#39;ll try to work on that in the future.<br><br>2.5) Fix&#39;d.<br><br>3) I... I got nothin&#39;.</p>

            <p>Like I said, it takes more than being OOC for a character to be a replacement.  If anything, they were probably possessed.  Also, as far as Viper goes, it doesn&#39;t really matter what happens in the fic if we never hear about it.  So far as I was aware, that one scene is all we ever get with Viper in it.  More importantly, though, your agents and the CAD shouldn&#39;t know about it if it hasn&#39;t happened yet, and you can&#39;t charge for something you don&#39;t know about.<br><br>I don&#39;t see anything in those two clips that would lead me to believe that Shifu is any more out of character than anyone else.<br><br>I am not convinced that Sephiroth was out of character in the scene we saw him in.  Did he have more to do later in the fic, as well?<br><br>I&#39;m kind of disappointed that you don&#39;t have any answer for number three.<br><br>All of this, as well as issues in pacing, makes me think that there is a larger problem, here.  I want you to be very honest with yourself when you answer this question: Did you rush the mission and cut it short because you were afraid of making it too long again?</p>

            <p>And for me, that one scene also had more than enough uncanon in it for me to charge.<br><br>Shifu... Okay, let me put it this way: Shifu is the old man of the bunch. He&#39;s out of touch with pop culture trends, he&#39;s a lot more mellow than the fic would have you believe he is, and he isn&#39;t so easily insulted by one of his students calling him a jerk. So that&#39;s why I had him replaced.<br><br>No, but in my eye, <i>any</i> villain character <i>who in canon pulls all the stops to kill various other canons</i> who does something stupid like lifting a guy as if to stab them and then being like &quot;oh, never mind, I&#39;m gonna let you live because the plot says so&quot; counts as someone being OOC for me. <br><br>The reason I don&#39;t have an answer ties into my answer for your question you left at the end. I won&#39;t say it was rushed because I don&#39;t think it was, but yes, I cut the mission short. I went to great pains editing it so it would stay below thirteen pages no matter what happened.</p>

            <p>Axel wasn&#39;t in it because he was never shown. Besides, after Tai Lung escaped from Chor Gohm, it&#39;s not likely they&#39;d ever use that prison again, especially since Chor Gohm was created to house one man. I think, anyway. So he was never shown, and thus was safe.</p>

            <p>I have yet another question for you folks : what would happen if a DoI operative completely botches his/her Intel gathering run and makes him/herself known to the people in the fic?<br>Would a mass neuralyzation be needed? An immediate Action Department intervention seems to be necessary, but how would it work out?<br><br>I&#39;m cooking up an idea for a mission involving an insane Spy that decides to &quot;go Rambo&quot; and to have his colleagues (and possibly the DIA&#39;s Special Response) try to contain him.

            <p>You should keep in mind that her agent wasn&#39;t actually part of DoI and was essentially doing it as part of a punishment detail (which she failed at doing), so that advice is invalid here.<br><br>Quite frankly, the fact of the matter is that you&#39;re going into uncharted territory in regards to what would happen because no one has written that sort of situation yet, so <i>you</i> are the one who decides what would happen.

            <p>It occured to me that, generally speaking, fanwriters need permission from other fanwriters before using their works. How does this fit into the writing of missions? I kind of doubt that every sporked mission had an author willing to let it be sporked...<br>Before you ask, I did try to reference the wiki, but for some reason, my computer won&#39;t let me access the mission-writing guide page, and I don&#39;t know where else in the wiki this might be addressed.

            <p>I fall victim of that quite easily (that&#39;s why I tend to take a looong time writing missions)<br><br>The best thing I can tell you (as it works for me) is to concentrate on the one you are still writing with no troubles and leave the first mission aside. Then, when you feel you truly want to start working on the mission again, re-read what you have written, do some corrections if you find something that sounds off, and don&#39;t be afraid to rewrite half of it.<br><br>For me, it works.

            <p>Sometimes when I get writers block I just start over. Like Phobos said, it&#39;s sometimes that a character has done something that doesn&#39;t fit, and if that happened at the very beginning, well, there sometimes isn&#39;t anything you can do to fix it. I&#39;d like to emphasize that this is only on shorter stuff that I&#39;ve done this, ie, everything I&#39;ve ever written.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to mention that one time, when I wrote myself into a corner in one of my missions (my agents got Sued,) and I was about to start over, I suddenly got a brilliant idea. Namely, I asked Caddy if he wanted to collab with me, and his agents swooped in and saved mine. Sometimes a sudden dramatic event can get a story going again.  Dunno if that&#39;s relevant. </p>

            <p>...that writers block is a sign that you have taken a wrong turn in your writing.  They would suggest going back and reading over what you have to try and find out where you went wrong.  Sometimes it is a small thing (a character reacts in a way that doesn&#39;t fit), but it can be a big thing (the main character goes to the warehouse, instead of the bank where he would meet character x).<br><br>So, take some time to let the writing sit.  Go do something else for a bit.  Then come back and go over what you have.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve experienced this before. Something&#39;s off. When I can&#39;t go on in that direction, it&#39;s because something just doesn&#39;t work the way it does. I think it&#39;s kind of a warning sign and it&#39;s good that it&#39;s there. If I would ignore that I&#39;d just, for example, pulled a character OOC, I&#39;d be a badfic author.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m back again to ask for permission, hopefully this time I&#39;ve improved enough to get it. So here we go :D<br><br>Name: Percy<br>Age:17<br>Height: 6’4”<br>Species: Humanish<br>Home Continuum: Original story<br>Lust Objects: Master Chief, Tali (list ongoing)<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Fandoms: Spyro the Dragon, Halo, Mass Effect, AVP, Adventure Time, MLP, Fallout, Elder Scrolls (so far)<br><br>Percy was a character from an original story that was scrapped in its early stages. In his home continuum, humans had decided that genetic manipulation was the next big social craze(right up there next to facebook and skinny jeans). Due to this, future generations were born with these modified traits, leading to the whole human race becoming not so human. With these changes came diseases, one of which affected Percy since he was born and would later be the catalyst in his unique appearance. His condition is also still active, it is just stabilized. He is a relaxed and generally outgoing person and instead of getting angry, he just gets pitiful and whiny. Unless, he is pushed to breaking point.<br><br>He chooses to be purposely oblivious as he believes the world is far more exciting when you can’t see it coming. This has led to a few arguments with his partner and best friend, Vorce. He is also fairly intelligent in areas that he enjoys and is not stupid, even if he acts like it. He found his way to the PPC after his word world began collapsing around him, as he was the main character in the story, from a lack of storyline and plot. After rescuing Vorce, who, being a bit character had begun to fade along with the story, fled through a newly opened plot-hole. After stumbling through the muiltiverse and several badfics, they fell into HQ where they were initially separated until meeting once again at the office of the Marquis De Sod.<br><br>Name: Vorce<br>Age:17<br>Height: 5’6”<br>Species: Humanish/Bunnyboy<br>Home continuum: Original story<br>Lust Objects: Unknown<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Fandoms: Mass Effect, Discworld, JSRF, MLP, Oddworld(so far)<br><br>Vorce was a character in an original story that was created to be Percy’s friend and voice of reason. However, he was given very little personality beyond being grumpy or easily angered, this means he is constantly one of these two until his personality properly develops, he is slowly improving.  He met Percy when being attacked by a group of boys for his appearance, as they saw his ears as girly and stupid. Percy stepped in and gladly took the punishment. Surprised by the strange boy’s actions, Vorce accepted his of friendship. When the story began to collapse, Vorce being a bit character began to fade, Percy rescued him from his fate and they fled into a plot-hole. The sensation of fading haunts him too this day.<br><br>He is a grumpy individual that is desperate for change in his personality. This leads to frustration when he gets angry at the people he cares about for no reason other than he can’t help it. He is a genuinely caring person, he just can’t show it.  Feels he owes Percy his life, so is fiercely loyal to him.  He also respects authority even if he doesn’t agree or like them, this won’t stop him from breaking rules if his friends are involved.  <br><br><br>Writing Sample: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Es4GMzqhKAF_lKGOy3ZBHmx1AQ6RISAbelpjFIJKJr0/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;pli=1"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Es4GMzqhKAF_lKGOy3ZBHmx1AQ6RISAbelpjFIJKJr0/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;amp;pli=1">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Es4GMzqhKAF_lKGOy3ZBHmx1AQ6RISAbelpjFIJKJr0/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;amp;pli=1</a></a><br><br>Agents: <a href="http://amplitudethewolf.deviantart.com/art/Oh-God-they-re-back-271630007"><a href="http://amplitudethewolf.deviantart.com/art/Oh-God-they-re-back-271630007">http://amplitudethewolf.deviantart.com/art/Oh-God-they-re-back-271630007</a></a><br><br>Mission fic:<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7462621/1/Noble_Revival"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7462621/1/Noble_Revival">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7462621/1/Noble_Revival</a></a></p>

            <p>Since I haven&#39;t seen you post on the board for over a month, for one, and for two, while I did consult someone who says you&#39;ve been a recent regular in the chatroom, I haven&#39;t been in there for a few weeks and didn&#39;t notice you in there very much before I stopped. Due to this, I can&#39;t make any calls based on your activity, and I won&#39;t, though personally I&#39;d suggest hanging around and posting on the board more often a well. Everyone can see who&#39;s been active on the board. Can&#39;t do the same with the chatroom. <br><br>To cut to the short, I won&#39;t be granting or not granting permission over this piece, since I don&#39;t know what your actual recent activity&#39;s been like. <br><br>That said, I&#39;m going to be giving <s>a bit of</s> concrit on the characters as presented and the piece overall, so give me a moment. <br><br>Going over Percy, you say he&#39;s from a world you wrote which had genetic manipulation be the be-all end-all to the point of the species becoming post-human, with diseases coming from it, and this- a disease- is why Percy looks such an oddball. This is fine. However, his condition- whatever it is- is stabilized. We don&#39;t know what this means. Why is this being brought up? Do you intend for him to have some sort of flareup from the whatever-it-is in the future?  If it is an actual concern for him, emotionally or mentally, we don&#39;t know. There&#39;s nothing that suggests its presence as an issue- we don&#39;t even know what the disease does or did in the past!- or as something beyond just &#39;Oh! He&#39;s these colors because of a disease.&#39; <br><br>If it&#39;s for the sake of his unique appearance, and it would not have anything else, you already have a built-in thing right there with the genetic manipulation already present in his background. Adding on the detail of a disease does nothing if it has no effect on him otherwise. <br><br>Out of curiosity, the genetic manipulation present in this story, was it of the &#39;Designer baby&#39; type, or the &#39;we can modify your genes and make you an entirely new you within a short period of time&#39; sort?<br><br>That said, the fact that he is actually smart- rather than being dumb as a brick- and prefers to take life as it comes is a nice touch, because usually people put &#39;oblivious&#39; and &#39;stupid&#39; in the same grouping, or that the &#39;oblivious&#39; act is to hide sheer cunning or other occasionally unsavory traits.<br><br>I&#39;ll touch on his relationship with Vorce in a bit.<br><br>As to Vorce, you&#39;re telling us he was created explicitly to be Percy&#39;s friend and a voice of reason- so this means he is from the same story/world, correct? If this is indeed the case, why is he being beaten up by a bunch of boys because they think his ears are &#39;girly&#39;?  The future in which this story is supposed to take place in is far from our own. If genetic manipulation is indeed such a craze, and one that&#39;s continued for a long period of time, they would not have the same values as far as appearance goes, for &#39;normal&#39;, &#39;masculine&#39;, &#39;feminine&#39; and so on.  If genetic manipulation can occur, those other boys could be just as varied in appearance as Vorce and Percy, and would be used to it in everyone around them. Vorce would be just another boy, not one that is unique enough to warrant being beat up.<br><br>Moving on, you say that his personality is based on being either grumpy or angry (and quick to rise to it). You&#39;ve also mentioned once before in Percy&#39;s section that Vorce was a bit character and beginning to disappear when the whole story collapsed. <br><br>This contradicts a few other things you&#39;ve said. If he was created explicitly to be Percy&#39;s friend and voice of reason, that is not a &#39;bit&#39; role. That is a secondary role to the protagonist, and often enough is also considered a main character position, especially if his role in the story was being rescued by Percy and becoming his friend due to this- and one near enough to become the voice of reason. That sort of role isn&#39;t a minor one in a story, nor is it one that is assigned to a bit or distant character.  <br><br>This ties into a rather large issue I see with the pair.<br><br>The dominant side of the relationship is, given the information you&#39;ve told us here, entirely on Percy&#39;s side. Percy saved Vorce, Percy offered to be friends with the guy he just saved from being beaten up, Percy saved Vorce again, Percy kinda ignores things until he really has to actually pay attention.<br><br>Vorce&#39;s role is sidekick. Vorce is the voice of reason- to someone who usually ignores things to just enjoy what&#39;s coming, better or worse.<br><br>But they&#39;re best friends. Are they, really, or is this you just following through with the roles you gave them for that previous story? What do they have in common beyond being sole survivors of that story? Beyond Percy repeatedly saving Vorce&#39;s bacon? What does being the voice of reason really do in return for someone who is so easy going and generally acts oblivious? There is a huge power imbalance in their dynamic with what you&#39;ve presented us with. In terms of &#39;give and take&#39; this isn&#39;t equal. Vorce is completely dependant on Percy in this relationship. You even state that Vorce feels like he owes his life to Percy to the point that he&#39;s repaying it with loyalty. <br><br><br><br><br>On the subject of your story: Given the amount of beta readers you credited at the beginning of it, there are more than a few minor errors scattered throughout the story- I see tense shifts within the narration, and missing or wrong punctuation, and letters that shouldn&#39;t be capitalized but are.<br><br>For example, with the tense shifts:<br><br>&#39;At this point some people may have begun to wonder why Percy had seemingly allowed his friend to be accosted by a horny, half-naked stranger. The answer is simple; he lived in his own world, of which was currently centered on getting something to eat. That and he felt that Vorce needed a little something to help him relax; he’s just that nice a friend(Read as misguided).&#39;<br><br>You switch between past and present a few times with just this one portion.<br><br>You also have a very hapazard usage of commas throughout the story. When someone is being addressed, a comma is placed before or after their name in accordance to the sentence order. Two examples of this done properly: &#39;Sure thing, Marquis!&#39;, or &#39;July, what the heck are you doing?&#39; <br><br>Additionally, you show no signs of them knowing who the Marquis de Sod is, or him introducing himself (or any indication that they would know what he is called), but you refer to the Marquis by name in the narration. You do the same with Luxury. Referring to characters by name when the characters you are following do not know them is confusing for the reader. As a general rule, you don&#39;t do that due to point of view. Which here, is mostly limited third person point of view, following one person at a time (with occasional interjections of omniscience).<br><br>Beyond that, it&#39;s clear you did do background reading to ensure you know what&#39;s the what, and your pacing is decent, as is your sense of humor and timing. </p>

            <p>In the order you brought them up, or clarify anything. I planned on being active on the board originally, but in the end I never really saw anything that I felt I had the need to comment on. I can try to be more active if need be, but I think it&#39;s pointless to post for postings sake. Thank you for not shooting down my request for that reason though.<br><br>On to Percy. After reading over the bio again, I agree that the stabilized comment is out of place. I brought up the point of his disease as it will be a plot point later. The reason I didn&#39;t discuss the disease anymore than this was for two reasons. The first being that I didn&#39;t want to drag the bio out since the wiki page said to keep it short. And second, that I wanted to have something in his past to work with that the reader was unsure of. Giving away all the imformation would make that point moot. If necessary I could tell you this information, but I would rather not.<br><br>The genetic manipulation is the second one, It would have been like going out and buying new clothes. Sorry for not clarifying that.<br><br>With Vorce, I will have to delve into some of the basic backstory of the world. Percy is a unique case even in his world. While the genetic manipulation was world wide, it wasn&#39;t super extensive. People stayed humanoid in appearance and didn&#39;t change too drastically. For example, every never had more or less than your basic limbs, aside from wings,tails and other such things,. The modifications could also be split into 2 basic categories, aesthetic and physical(the boys were of the physical type, hence the attack). Both of these groups have what could amount to a sense of racism against each other,this coupled with a group of teens egging each other on led to the situation.<br><br>On to the idea of Vorce being a bit character. I might have exaggerated the idea slightly, he is however a very flat character to begin with, because of this it felt easier to explain with the term bit-character. He literally had a nothing but a sentence of personality and a picture. <br><br>The story, however, never made it as far as that, and in their world&#39;s timeline they would have fled throught the plothole a month or so after meeting.<br><br>The relationship between Percy and Vorce is similar to how to see it, but a few key things are missing from the story. I&#39;ll explain these for clarity. Percy is the dominant side of the relationship,for the simple reason Vorce doesn&#39;t currently have the personality to make too many of these decisions. This, is something I planned to remedy over time throughout missions and interludes,with Vorce slowly becoming a more dominant character on his own.<br><br>Vorce&#39;s role in the original story was a sidekick role, the story wasdropped before he could develop. I could have easily fixed this before using him as an agent, but I felt the whole idea would make an interesting plot element. I kept him that way for that reason.<br><br>That leads into your next point,yes they are partially playing out their roles. However, they did spend time falling through the multiverse and in that time they became closer, they only had each other to rely on. Also, Vorce has saved Percy, just as many times as Percy saved him.<br><br>Now, Percy&#39;s main reason for so quickly stepping up to become Vorce&#39;s friend was because of his disease, its symptoms meant Percy had very few friends growing up, and after his operation, it was just as hard, but for different reasons. He suffered, and choseto step in to stop someone elses.  To be honest, Percy probably relies on Vorce more than Vorce relies on him.  <br><br>With the SPaG, thank you for pointing out the problem with the names, I will fix that when I get a chance. And I am already working on the general punctuation problems,as my betas pointed that out too.<br><br>All in all, I hope this cleared up some things related to my characters,and if you have anymore questions relating to them, Don&#39;t be afraid to ask. Also sorry if there are any mistakes in this, I didn&#39;t have the time to read over it :)<br></p>

            <p>YES! Think on this for a second. Everyone, from Floaters, Badslashers, and Assassins to the Bean Counters, the Security Dandelions, and the Janitors needs to see this. Think about it for a minute. SOPA allows people to shut down any website for even the slightest copyright infringement, anywhere, in any way or context. So, potentially: Anything with user-generated content? Gone. Meaning: The Pit? Gone. LiveJournal? Gone. Fanfiction on the Web as a whole? Gone. Where does that leave the PPC? GONE! Oppose SOPA, people! It will kill the internet! If ever we must stand with Anonymous, this is the time! I may not be an American, but this will effect me just as much as any of you. Spread the word!</p>

            <p>For further writing practice, I am working on some MLP:FIM fanfics. I have a little vignette ready for beta (Prince Blueblood meets a buddy after the gala fiasco, and then Princess Luna bawls him out over his treatment of Rarity). Could somepony please beta this?<br><br>I also plan to work on the FIM equivalent of <i>Don&#39;t Panic</i> (a brony finds himself a pony in Equestria and naturally has trouble adjusting; he ultimately succeeds in adjusting to his new body and life, but it is hard). I know the hands-to-hooves change is a major change--<i>Doctor Whooves and Assistants</i> has Thete struggling with this. Also, would he have to learn a whole new array of phonemes? And what other obstacles would he face?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d love to beta your fic. In regards to the <i>Don&#39;t Panic</i>-style fic:<br><br>1) The hands-to-hooves transition might be made easier if he&#39;s a unicorn, thanks to the ability of magic to pick up things, but I&#39;m sure that you could work it out via having the MC carefully observe other ponies using their hooves and experimenting with his own, if you don&#39;t want to go the unicorn route. <br><br>1b) I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;d have to learn any new language; the biggest change I&#39;ve observed in the FiM &#39;Verse is the use of &quot;-pony&quot; instead of &quot;-one&quot;; &quot;Somepony&quot; instead of &quot;Someone&quot;, etc, so it could take a while until that speech pattern is formed. <br><br>2) If you had him be anything other than an Earth pony, he&#39;d have to deal with that race&#39;s (sub-species&#39;?) inherent talents, namely the unicorns&#39; magic and the pegasis&#39; flight abilities. Granted, we&#39;ve already seen that nopony thinks it odd that Fluttershy stays on the ground or that Sweetie Belle can&#39;t (or won&#39;t) do magic, but it could be a story arc worth exploring.</p>

Sorry about the confusion!<br><br>Basically, McKaLoy messed with the RA, and instead of it jumping them forward two weeks in the fic only, it jumped them two weeks forward in HQ time as well.

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t think Sues have souls.  The way the PPC sees them, they aren&#39;t people - which is why it&#39;s okay to kill (and occasionally eat) them.  In the case of continua with a canonical afterlife, even a really easily accessible one like in MSPA, I don&#39;t think a Sue would go there just because she was never really a person in that world to begin with.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m wondering: if an agent dies on a mission in such a continuum, what would the results of that be?</p>

            <p>Probably depends on the universe the agent was in at the time, but if the universe has a god/ruler/etc. then i&#39;m pretty sure that making right what went wrong counts as a good deed. If the agent&#39;s home continuum has an afterlife though, then i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you naturally(reflexively? instinctively?) drifted towards that.</p>

            <p>It is my own personal view that Mary Sues/Marty Stus do not have souls if only because chasing them down in the afterlife to kill them again is needlessly tasteless (a view which others have reflected in previous comments.) Plus - from a purely structural viewpoint - the assassination of the Sue should be the climax of the mission. Doing it twice only hinders the overall story.<br><br>It should be taken into account that some Sues or Stus might be created as ghosts or spirits. *glares at the Danny Phantom continuum* Even in such a situation, one wouldn&#39;t need to go into the Underworld to hunt down the Sue. Just grab an unlicensed nuclear accelerator and remember not to cross the streams.</p>

            <p>Well, my point was more in line with hS&#39; post, further down-- if there is an afterlife in the continuum, it&#39;d be (presumably) ruled by the deities of that continuum, and PPC Agents chasing down souls might not be entirely welcome.</p>

            <p>As Mary Sue power is nearly nonexistent on deities, they either would be denied afterlife or would generate an afterlife of their own. So there are three total cases:<br><br>Case 1: Sue never had a soul to begin with. Sue is deader than dead. Approx. 90% Sues?<br>Case 2: Sue is denied access to afterlife.

            <p>Hi there everyone, I found out about you guys along time ago, but back then I wasn&#39;t interested in fanfiction so I didn&#39;t really care. Since then I&#39;ve come to greatly enjoy reading some of the better works and occasionally writing my own, so when I re-found this then it sounded like a wonderful place. I told my friend, who will go by salubriousFool, and he said he would love to partner up with me. We plan on hanging around here while we finish reading the Original series and working out our agents origin stories which we will most likely use as our writing sample. After we finish both and have been here awhile, then we can&#39;t wait to get permission and start hunting sues!</p>

            <p>my fandoms are Homestuck, Touhou, and supernatural. but I play alot of video games. assassin&#39;s creed, halo, Shin Megami Tensei (and spinoffs) and Bioshock jump to mind at first but like I said, i play a lot so I&#39;ll likely have a good amount of knowledge about it if it came out relatively recently.</p>

            <p>I am the Fool in question. I heard about the site via Jack&#39;s request and became interested due to the strive to maintain canon. If it&#39;s anything I enjoy more than a good body of work, it&#39;s to see that the story in question gets its storyline followed. Frankly, Sues sicken me and it&#39;s nice to see that there&#39;s an online team of agents whose sole duty is to uphold the canon and eradicate the badfics of the internet and make it a better place overall.<br><br>Looking forward to some good times ahead!</p>

I don&#39;t think Mid-Childa ever MADE Unison Devices--Nanoha Wiki says that it was Belka-only, and the two we see in Nanoha are both Belkan. I think that Zest mentioned that &quot;[Agito] was a genuine device...&quot;, suggesting that Mid is trying to develop them, but...I don&#39;t know. </p>

            <p>While Corolla does in fact use mainly Mid-Childan magic, I mainly intended &quot;Mid-Childan Unison Device&quot; as &quot;Unison Device coming fro Mid-Childa (planet)&quot;. But now that you are making me think about it, that&#39;s quite confusing<br><br>How was she created is a different matter entirely, as she was recruited from a (fictional) badfic, so in a way she actually <i>could</i> be a &quot;Mid-Childan&quot; UD. I think I&#39;ll address the matter in the next mission, as Nikki is probably curious about what Corolla is... and if I decide to make her a Belkan UD once living on Mid-Childa I&#39;ll edit Wiki article and missions/interludes accordingly.<br>It will be the perfect occasion to drop in some of my Agents&#39; backstory.<br><br><br>I have my reasons to give Corolla Mid-Childan magic instead of Belkan, as the latter is much more melee-oriented... a thing that doesn&#39;t work when you are six inches tall and lack an Armed Device to attack with.

            <p>Her backstory (as far as I decided it) is that her Linker Core is still recovering from the injuries she received before Sergio found her (basically saving her from being a expendable victim), and out of MGLN it&#39;s taking quite a lot of time to do it. That&#39;s also why she is half-size now - she does that to conserve mana. (While not as much as familiars, it&#39;s implied that for an UD keeping &quot;human&quot; size takes mana. If my interpretation isn&#39;t wrong, keeping a smaller size should lessen &quot;living&quot; mana upkeep, allowing more to be used in spells)<br><br></p>

            <p>Hmm.....I know that Rein can go full-size, but I don&#39;t know if she could become even smaller...my interpretation is that a familiar or UD has a couple modes (like an Intelligent Device), and that the minimum mana usage would be, say, Arf&#39;s child or puppy mode, or RH&#39;s pendant mode. I don&#39;t think they can mess around with their own settings like that.<br><br>Of course, that&#39;s just my interpretation. As of now, I don&#39;t think canon has mentioned this, so obviously you can do what you like, and as long as it&#39;s logical in-story there shouldn&#39;t be a problem. </p>

            <p>While it was clearly a warning round as the two namelless Agents were charging at them (the scene was meant as a take that to people who think the PPC is only about killing Sues, while that mentality is actually strongly discouraged), you&#39;re right about the fact that Sergio actually fired the gun, a behaviour really dangerous.

            <p>Hey, guys! Found a badfic(<a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/7732345/1/">The Mouse and The Hare</a>), if anyone in the Redwall area is looking for something to spork, unless this is already taken. It&#39;s kind of nuts. We have it all. Telepathy, a mysterious object (a stone, by the way), and she gets Baz. While I admire this Sue&#39;s fine taste in malebeasts, she is a Sue, and therefore must be assassinated. As I am not yet an Agent, I can&#39;t go out and kill her, as much as I would like to. So, I leave it to someone else. Have at it, guys, and make sure you link to the sporking!<br><br> I wasn&#39;t quite sure if there was a particular thread, and searched but didn&#39;t find one, so I started one. Tell me if I&#39;m wrong!</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve seen around here, you don&#39;t label posts &#39;mission for X department&#39; unless you&#39;re actually posting a mission.

At one point she supports her argument with a quotation establishing that GSUSA is a place where &quot;you can be yourself and who you are, and not something that you&#39;re not.&quot;<br><br>...Which is kind of the point of letting an MTF transgender join, hm?<br><br>I say kudos to this girl for speaking her mind, putting herself out there, and presenting her arguments in a very organized and mature manner.

            <p>I agree with you. While I was never a Scout of any kind, whether Beavers, Cubs or what have you- Canadian Cadet Movement is where I belong- I definitely like the general concept of scouts, because our organizations have a lot in common- uniforms, respect, serving the community, and the general goal of helping to create productive members of society.<br><br> It&#39;s good to know that this girl can stand up for what she believes. A lot of people would see something the precieve as wrong, and do nothing about it. She has my utmost respect. But...<br><br>This right here seems to be an example of people interpreting a phrase differently. I look at this in the psychological and emotional aspect- the transgender girlscouts feel that they are girls, not boys. She looks at it differently- they were meant, physically, to be male, and therefore they are trying to be something they&#39;re not. It&#39;s one of those arguments nobody will ever win, isn&#39;t it? Personal belief-based arguments like this are difficult to carry out and oftentimes leave a rift between the two sides, and burns previously sturdy bridges.<br><br> I&#39;m a supporter of LGBT rights as well. It seems to me that love is love, and love is blind. It knows no gender, no age, and no bounds. So who is anyone to place them upon it? Similarly, who is anyone to tell another person their gender? Be what you want. You are you, and anyone who can&#39;t accept that was never your friend in the first place.<br><br> Please let me say I&#39;m not trying to force my opinion on anyone, although I&#39;d simply love it if people adopted it. I&#39;m simply offering it, and I love to be offered other people&#39;s opinions as well- any issue should be seen from all sides. I&#39;m glad someone brought this up here, and I wish everyone a pleasant day.</p>

            <p>I guess the question is: What&#39;s more truly a person--their physical body, or their brain and the information in it? I say the brain; and if the brain is female, then the person is female. It&#39;s just that other people can&#39;t see your brain, only your body; so it&#39;s a fight between what other people see and what you know you are.<br><br>If it makes a difference for you scientifically-oriented folks, the brain scans of transgender people do match the gender they experience themselves as. A body/brain mismatch. Or, to put it in social terms, a self-image/others&#39;-image-of-you mismatch.</p>

            <p>Why do people buy Girl Scout cookies? It&#39;s usually not because they care about funding the Girl Scouts; usually, people want to actually eat the cookies (go figure). If you want to protest the admission of transgenders into GSUSA, knock yourself out (I don&#39;t particularly approve of the decision myself). But if you like the cookies, why deprive yourself of them to make a point that you could make in a number of other ways? You could make a countervideo, for example.<br>Then again, this is coming from someone whose favorite cookie is the Thin Mint, so my opinion may be overly biased (albeit for a somewhat unusual reason).</p>

            <p>If their sales skyrocket this year (which I am hoping for), they&#39;ll know people approve of their decision. If their sales drop, on the other hand, who knows? They might reconsider.<br><br>Personally, I would hope for equality and people thinking inclusively to trump any silliness like this, but I&#39;d rather not take chances.

            <p>There&#39;s been some awesome PPC canon created through RP before--including some missions, &#39;fics that are part of some of the Major Events, and just plain fun and character development. Sometimes it can be hard to figure out where to go to just do some spontaneous RP with Agents, just to see where it&#39;ll go.<br><br>Well, now we&#39;ve got a place! Over at Dreamwidth we now have <a href="http://ppchq.dreamwidth.org">PPC Headquarters</a>.<br><br>Whether it&#39;s just feeling like having your Agents run around Headquarters or to test out that Agent giving you ideabunnies at the most inconvenient times, PPCHQ is the place to go. The Constitution applies, and basic rules of RP such as &quot;no godmodding.&quot;<br><br>So come on over, make an account for your Agent(s), and have some hijinx. If you&#39;re new to this kind of RP and have any questions, there are plenty of us who can answer questions.<br><br>Also: Yay, RP comm for HQ!<br><br>(Yeah, my eloquence broke down.

            <p>Good mission. The only thing is, my sister is named Teagan. So whenever I read the Sue&#39;s name, I get horrible, horrible mental images...But your writing was good!<br><br>Incidentally, if you bring a child back from a fic, your characters don&#39;t have to adopt it, right? I ask because there&#39;s two ten-year-old versions of Canon characters, and there&#39;s no way they can integrate--at least, one of them can&#39;t. </p>

            <p>Thank you, and that is a strange coincidence! Your sister is probably a million times better then Sue!Teagan.<br><br>As for the child question, no, you do not have to adopt them. Like with Minis (or other oddities) you can easily just have them put into the Nursery/OFU/Adoption Center they would belong most in.<br><br>I was actually tempted to adopt one of the kids, but my agents aren&#39;t really cut out for parental duty (though them trying to raise a kid could be funny material Hmmmm...). </p>

            <p>Well, she&#39;s as annoying as every other little sister out there, but no where near as bad as this Sue. The name is actually Welsh for &#39;beautiful&#39;<br><br>Although, you know when a mispelling or somesuch will make, say, a Sue with her arms handcuffed behind her back have raise them over her head so that her hands are in front of her, which should logically dislocate her arms?

            <p>In which a Sue burns in the sun, the agents have fun with each other, and crazy times are had all around.<br><br>I especially loved the back and forth between Miah and Cadmar in this mission, and how childlike it got. Reminds one that they&#39;re not so different as they claim, ya know? And the dialogue was really funny at several points.<br><br>There are a couple issues somewhere.
