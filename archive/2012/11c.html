            <p>Well, first of all, I decided a long time ago that Dvorak&#39;s &quot;Humoresque&quot; is pretty much the extent of the soundtrack that runs through Jack the Hunter&#39;s head. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38Ark5MQE8"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38Ark5MQE8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38Ark5MQE8</a></a> Though the theme from &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; would also work, or &quot;When Can I See You Again&quot; by Owl City if you want something with lyrics.<br><br>Kestrel&#39;s is definitely Heather Alexander&#39;s &quot;March of the Cambreadth&quot;. When she&#39;s in Full Vermin Mode it&#39;s more like the Scissor Sisters&#39; &quot;I Can&#39;t Decide&quot;.<br><br>Adder&#39;s might be Nickelback&#39;s &quot;Lullaby&quot; for her or Deuce&#39;s lower moments, or &quot;Stand&quot; by Rascal Flatts<br><br>Not sure what Deuce&#39;s might be, at least in relationship to the PPC. In relation to his story, it&#39;s either The Offspring&#39;s &quot;You&#39;re Gonna Go Far Kid&quot; or &quot;No Roads Left&quot; by Linkin Park.<br><br>Caleb&#39;s is totally &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; and he will fight anyone who says otherwise.</p>

            <p>I was reading pokemon fanfiction and I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8623331/1/NEW-HEROES-OF-OTHER-WORLDS">NEW HEROES OF<br>OTHER WORLDS</a> (yes, in all caps). I can spot a character who I believe<br>to be a stu, given that he has the same name as the author, the very<br>rare dimensional scream ability(which is only found in the Mystery<br>Dungeon Explorers subcontinuum, but he is in Sinnoh). There are also<br>some inconsistencies in the geography, such as Palkia being at<br>&quot;Pillar Mountain&quot; as opposed to Spear Pillar (which is the peak of<br>Mt. Coronet) or Spacial Rift.<br><br>I can furthermore notice some rather odd occurrences, such as a<br>souless (are these from Kingdom Hearts?) turning into a pony then<br>possessing a plant and nearly killing the main characters, then<br>turning good when he finds out that a pony he was fighting plays<br>violin. Some of this even stretches the bounds of humor, such as<br>randomly changing focus to Mobius to include the Sonic cast.<br><br>I also notice some errors in english language syntax, such as<br>&quot;fall <b>of</b> a cliff&quot; and &quot;rattacate&quot;, as well as an introduction<br>which is written in prose, with the rest of the narrative being in<br>script format with prose mixed in. On top of that, the story is a<br>crossover of four (five?) different continua, which seldom ends<br>well.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure though if this is bad enough to merit a PPC mission<br>though. There are a decent number of attempts at humor, but they don&#39;t<br>always work. It looks like it may be just a group of friends trying to<br>write a story together. Is this PPC worthy?</p>

            <p>My stomach is actually hurting from laughing so much. The sheer illogicality of this fic just makes it that much funnier. The best part by far though was ThatOne&#39;s bit about the evil toasters. And the beginning, that was hilarious as well. I feel like if I ever met any of my own characters they&#39;d either want to hurt me, smile apologetically as they hold one of my other characters back so that they don&#39;t hurt me, just start screaming &quot;WHY!&quot;</p>

            <p><i>All of this Quotev business has inspired me to write up these little fragments. Please ignore the fact that the gap between Episode 2 and Episode 3 is starting to parallel Valve&#39;s production cycle.<br><br>Anyways, presenting an excerpt of Marianne&#39;s diary and the chat log of a conversation between Luisa and Penny. I might continue the Wire tap feature whenever I feel lazy and I don&#39;t want to finish an episode...<br><br>In case anybody is wondering, the two fics referenced in the second part are real.

Ever since Makes-Things and his technicians have updated the fan fiction detection protocols we have been working around the clock to process the hundreds, if not thousands of stories in what has been recently dubbed as the “circle of lemmings” by some of our agents. <br><br>There is an astonishing quantity of badfic on the website and nearly every mission to the BBC Sherlock ‘verse has greeted me with a character profile of some sort. Links to gallery-like images of clothing pollute the text of certain fanfics and threaten to throw Spies out of the story should they try to follow the link. Agent Harris Frost of Orange team is still missing in action after he radioed HQ about investigating a link to the mysterious [polyvore] site. Multiverse communications are still unable to reach him.<br><br>I voiced my concerns with fellow Spy San Lorenzo who said that even if Frost is a fool, he does not deserve to be left alone in a giant virtual wardrobe. I earnestly hope he will be found soon. The poor boy has been through a lot recently: I hear his co-workers have been bullying him ever since he flooded the Action Room on his first day at work. <br><br>Agent Chang told me a few minutes ago that Sorting detected an actual God!Sue in the Percy Jackson ‘verse. I do not envy the agents that will be sent to kill this one, but I will feel sorry for them. Unless they are truly insane, I am sure that fighting an omnipotent being is not something that would appear on a normal person&#39;s bucket list.<br><br>As far as Action duty goes, it is a seemingly endless chain of back-to-back Intel runs. As soon as you return from a mission, the console already has another one queued up for you. Agents Minin and De Grasse have each spent a total of eight continuous hours in the Harry Potter continuum in search of Mary Sues—and they are still on the hunt. Arguments in favour of the Nexus initiative have been growing exponentially. While some argue that building permanent outposts in the Word Worlds will interrupt the traditional cycle of sorting, assigning, and scouting, I feel that it is a good idea to set up rest houses for Spies on stakeout duty.<br><br>But that’s enough rambling for now.

            <p>So... penguins. They kind of <i>have</i> to cuddle all winter, don&#39;t they?<br><br>That said, welcome to the board, my shtick is pulling random stuff out of my pockets and passing it off. Have a can of ravioli, some ice cubes, and a tube of toothpaste as your welcome to the board. Oh, and I guess you can have the rest of the bleepnerds that I stole off somebody&#39;s desk...</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Board! Have some of my world-famous hydrophobic water. K-Blooee Industries are not to be held liable if you want to swim in a pool of this stuff. Seriously, don&#39;t do it.<br><br>If you haven&#39;t done so already, you should definitely take a look at the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">Original Series</a>, the first-ever PPC missions written by Jay and Acacia.<br><br>Another Zelda fan! In that case, have this authentic Hylian Shield, fresh from the blacksmith&#39;s. What&#39;s your favourite Zelda game?

Maybe it&#39;s the random line breaks where other people&#39;s text would have stretched across the screen. Your username is quite poetic as well. Anyway, I shall now present you with a Thinking Cap™! Whenever you have writer&#39;s block, just don your Thinking Cap™ and it clears your mind of all the cobwebs that are obstructing your creativity.<br>Warning: TheMadHatteress is not responsible for any damage caused by your Thinking Cap™, which may include inability to tell reality from fiction, singed hair, and a sudden urge to act like Sherlock Holmes.</p>

Feel free to leave any sanity you might have left in the labeled bins; you won&#39;t be needing it here. <br><br>You don&#39;t have to write fanfiction, but if you can tell the difference between good and bad and you have the ability to find humor in it, you&#39;re welcome here. As an expression of that I give to you this music box. The song changes every time you open it, so you&#39;ll never get bored. It is liable to come up with some very oddball songs though.

            <p>I was just on the legendary goodfic page, and I&#39;d like to add to it if it&#39;s not stepping on anybody&#39;s toes. I&#39;m a Sherlockian, (ACD, in case anyone&#39;s interested,) and I&#39;d like to add A Young British Solider, a highly influential fic among those of us who are hardcore about our historical accuracy, and the source of a large amount of fanon about the original Sherlock Holmes stories. (To select just one example, it reconciles the canon plot-hole of exactly where Watson&#39;s war wound is by saying that while he was <i>shot</i> in the shoulder he had a secondary injury to his leg.)<br><br>However, if I haven&#39;t been around enough to be poking the wiki - or if somebody has objections to expanding the page and adding fics here and there, I&#39;m perfectly fine with that. If nothing else, I&#39;ve given you guys some goodfic to read, should you be at all interested. :)</p>

            <p>So SC, Lily, ThatOne, SingingTheThunder, firemagic, and I -pauses to catch her breath- are MSTing a Doctor Who badfic, and the topic of Suvian emotions (&#39;emoshuns&#39;) came up. SC and I are wondering if there is a list of Suvian emoshuns on the Wiki (there doesn&#39;t appear to be), and if such a thing is un/necessary to have anyway.<br><br>I was thinking it could be a quickie reference page, kind of like the Suvian color spectrum page. Examples of emoshuns are &#39;twu wuv&#39; and &#39;sarcasum&#39;.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve all seen examples of twu wuv, wangst, and trajeck pasts in Suefics, but are there real life examples for these new ones? I think it&#39;ll be a stronger list if there are, supposing that its purpose is to point out the inherent shallowness of Mary Sue characters/characterization. It doesn&#39;t work so well if it&#39;s mostly stuff we&#39;ve made up in this thread; all that shows is that we can make stuff up.<br><br>Also, how do concepts that aren&#39;t actually emotions fit in, like sarcasm and tragic backstories? And, beware of going overboard with the bad spelling. For instance, if you were making fun of shallow revenge plots, would you actually pronounce it &quot;revunge&quot;? (Perhaps &quot;rahvenge&quot;?) What about &quot;fwendsheep&quot;? (Just &quot;fwendship,&quot; maybe?) Just some things to think about.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>With suvian &quot;characterization&quot; traits and emotions. For example, &quot;trajeck&quot; back-stories, Rahvenge, and Sarcasum are parts of a sue&#39;s &quot;characterization&quot; whereas stuff like &quot;twu wuv,&quot; is an emotion. (Having friendsheep in the story is more of a plot/characterization point, especially if it&#39;s about the sue&#39;s &quot;BFF&quot; who is only there when convenient. I support the spelling of friendsheep over fwendship, by the way, if only for the added puns about these people&#39;s role in the story.)</p>

Because the Prince of Wales is next in line for the throne, not her, and the Prince of Wales is generally the eldest son of the reigning monarch because male primogeniture passes the throne to the guys and why am I talking about this I am Chinese-American for crying out loud) in the process? <br><br>Also: FRANCE HAS NO KING. FRANCE NEEDS NO KING. And what imaginary French monarch in their right mind would ever, ever, <i>ever</i> name their kid Gиorge; it&#39;s Georges in French for one, and most French princes/kings were named Louis.<br><br>The Anglophile in me needs her tea. Sorry.</p>

            <p>Indeed. This whole thing is clearly nothing but borrowing the universe in name only as a vehicle for the obnoxiously named sue. On the other hand, the charges are so blatant that you could probably hop in this one with a fictionary in one hand and a weapon of your choice in the other and have the sue killed by the second chapter. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m talking about beginner-beginners. People who don&#39;t skip some of the introductory steps by learning via reading, especially - from a technical standpoint, first can be harder to get things right in, but you&#39;re probably good if you&#39;ve done enough first person perspective reading that you can learn a bit by osmosis.<br><br>...

            <p>The formula for the average teen novel:<br>A teenage girl, who claims to be an social outcast and doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s pretty (and almost invariably complains about her chest).<br>Her nemesis, miss evil popular cheerleader.<br>A super awesome hot guy who is like, totally the sweetest and most perfect guy EVER. <br>Assorted BFFs.<br>An extremely stereotypical high school, where the cliques are easily defined and labeled.<br>A life changing event, like moving to a new school.<br>Some drama, as ultra perfect guy seems completely out of reach due to plot related circumstances/being of a different social status. This makes up most of the plot. BFFs may console her, the nemesis will try to steal the guy or upset her life in some other way.<br>Some big event, like a party or a dance. Heroine dresses up in an overdescrbed outfit that makes her look gorgeous. Plot is coming to a climax--heroine, aided by this outfit and maybe by some friends, gives the nemesis her due, gets with the perfect guy, and might resolve the rest of the plot while she&#39;s at it. Guy and girl kiss with long sappy description, and book ends.<br>This is all done from first person.<br><br>I have to admit, I read the occasional teen novel. Some of them are well written, and both the hero and heroine are developed, interesting characters. Then it&#39;s just a good romance. And even the other kind can be fun to read just because. I indulge my idiotic girly side every once in a while.<br>Although in general, I dislike teen romance. Lord of the Rings for the win!<br></p>

            <p>why so many young women write Sues. After all, when a majority of the books marketed at the young adult female age group conform to that basic plotline, those who don&#39;t branch out and read, say, the classics or any other books not geared specifically towards them tend to fall into the mentality that that&#39;s the fundamentals of a good story.<br><br>I find it funny how that&#39;s also the plotline of many chick flicks and a couple Taylor Swift songs.

            <p>I am so glad every time I meet &quot;normal&quot; girls who purchase this kind of media that I grew up catching frogs and reading sci-fi and fantasy and Black Beauty.<br><br>(Yeah, I read a lot of horse books when I was eight - many of them were the same, but a lot of books marketed at kids always boil down to the same standard plots, especially something that basically boils down to fantasy-fulfilment, such as horse and pony books. Still, I like to think that finding out that too many similar horse books bored me when I was eight and nine, and noticing that I could successfully predict the plot of every new Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys book that I picked up helped me grow up and stay away from the repetitive romance tripe when I was a teen. At least horse books and Nancy Drew are essentially harmless.)</p>

            <p>... To write original fiction that doesn&#39;t give a frack about marketable plotlines and which isn&#39;t suspiciously similar to things I&#39;ve already seen. This means that any romance that goes on comes up because I&#39;m halfway through writing and I realize that characters have chemistry, (this has actually earned the appreciation of a few people... who wish it would happen more often, but eh,) and that if I have a plot that could have been standard, I try and do something to make it funny, interesting, point out problems with the genere, or crossed with another genre.<br><br>I haven&#39;t written much fandom in a while, but I usually stick to things that would be plausible as &quot;forgotten episodes,&quot; or cut chapters, or stuff about minor characters. I usually figure that if I don&#39;t pay attention to the vast body of fandom&#39;s strange ideas about characters, I&#39;ll do better. Though I do check if my plotbunnies are just migratory things from a fic I read a couple weeks ago or if they&#39;re the real thing. </p>

            <p>Makes sense, definitely, although our goals may be shaped by experiences. I write two OFUs, for one, which are essentially a meta version of every other fantasy school plot out there. What makes them different are the classes, the focus of the overarching semester, the antagonists. I have formulaic bits taken from OFUM, but I try to add a twist, to convey it in a new way.<br><br>As for fandom I&#39;ve made a name for myself with Sherlock AUs, including a Sherlock/Tangled crossover and a Never Let Me Go AU. The existing fics out there for Tangled were unfinished, and one of them seemed a bit OOC. The existing Never Let Me Go AU obviously never read the book. So my versions didn&#39;t seek to copy them, only sought to be my take on the subject and hopefully be an improvement from what was there before.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve made it my goal to…<br>Write well.<br>Yes, that&#39;s it. As I said earlier, I enjoy the occasional well-written teen novel. I don&#39;t care if the plot has been overdone, if it&#39;s written well I wil enjoy it. Granted, it&#39;s harder to write something well if the plot is overdone and silly.<br>And I write what I want to read. So I just try to write well with whatever idea I have. Most of the time, those ideas aren&#39;t clichйd just because I don&#39;t tend to gravitate towards that. But if I decided to do, say, a Christmas fic, my only goal would be to write it well.</p>

            <p>It would improve the quality of any sort of writing. I mean, I don&#39;t put my characters through a Sue test if I think they&#39;re getting Sue-y, I step back and imagine that this was a story I was reading, and would I like this character. So far, I don&#39;t think a Sue has ever been posted to ff.net under my name. :)</p>

            <p>I started to read a couple years early (I was three,) so I got a lot of extra kids-section reading done between the ages of seven and ten. I learned comedy early and knew better than to take those later teen paperbacks seriously. It also gave me a taste for fantasy, so I followed a couple of anthologies and the classics directly into the adult section at eleven or twelve and didn&#39;t come back out except on my way out of the library.<br><br>That and I&#39;ve always spent enough time reading that I don&#39;t want to waste my time on predictable, sueish high school drama. ;)</p>

            <p>When I head to the bookstore, almost every single YA novel will involve a romance subplot. I mostly have to stick to adult fiction (or head to the children&#39;s section - I&#39;m pretty sure that last time I went, that&#39;s where, say, the So You Want To Be A Wizard novels were.) One of my friends has a litmus test where if a teen novel mentions anything resembling romance on the back cover/inside flap or in the first chapter, then she&#39;s not going to get it.</p>

            <p>Although, a lot of the JYA (Middle School marketed,) fantasy has pretty good stuff at my local library, but that&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t have romance subplots or, if it does, it&#39;s incidental. I agree completely with the adult and kiddie sections having the best stuff: picture me, ten years old (or you could just picture Hermione Granger - the stack of books was about the right size,) explaining to the librarian why I had half my stack from the adult section and half from the kids section. <br><br>That happened a lot, now that I think of it. But So You Want To Be A Wizard was in JYA at my library, probably because the first few books were written long enough ago that they probably were marketed for kids, on the assumptions that older teens would read adult novels. </p>

            <p>I feel a rant coming on...<br>She&#39;s doing the Percy Jackson equivalent of the Tenth member of the Fellowship: joining the quest in The Lightning Thief. In a later book, Chiron explains that three is a strong number and <i>objects</i> (key word) to a four member quest (and none of the characters <i>there</i> were Sues!). And she seems to be usurping Annabeth&#39;s role. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she breaks up the Percabeth. <br>And not only is she messing with <i>that</i> numerology, she&#39;s the <i>fourteenth</i> Olympian! In the mythology, Hestia stepped down so Dionysus could become an Olympian and keep the number twelve. But of <i>course</i> that doesn&#39;t matter to the Sue.<br>And oh, lookit that, it can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s movieverse or bookverse.<br>And she gets turned to stone by Medusa and COMES BACK. <br>And the best lines are plagiarized right from the book.<br>And minis.<br>And she gets claimed as a GODDESS. If only I knew how to curse in ancient Greek (Klingon doesn&#39;t seem appropriate).<br>Gods, I want to kill her.  I don&#39;t have Permission, but if whoever sporks it needs help with Greek Mythology/Percy Jackson, I am available. In fact, I offer in advance to beta read.</p>

Earth to suethor, there&#39;s a reason that the demigods were, well, <i>demi</i>gods.

            <p>Your sentiment is shared greatly. If I had permission, I would send my agents out there without a care as to whether or not they were qualified. I myself am not a huge fan (having read the books when I was younger but kinda abandoning the new series) but I have a friend who is <i>obsessed</i> with the series and just thinking of her reading males me cringe.

            <p>The making-words-into-hyperlinks thing is part of HTML format. With similar codes you can also make words <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and a ton of other more complicated things. I found that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia</a> actually has a decent tutorial for the codes.<br><br>If you are using HTML though, you need to preview the message before you post it, because if you get one character wrong it will do something like turn the entire text into italics.</p>

            <p>Well, my family&#39;s tradition is to just have everyone over. I ended up playing with my four-year-old cousin. At one point, she decided to take a nap, so she crawled into my bed. Then she wanted to look at random things on my shelves (a dollhouse, a snowglobe, then a pair of pom-poms.) Then she wanted a story, and I got a few pages into the Butter Battle Book before she seemed to go to bed. Then about five minutes later she got out of bed and started playing with some dolls. For like half an hour.<br><br>And my quote...<br><br>(Two injured superpowered girls:)<br>Rezia: Have you healed up?<br>Iliya: I think so.

I don&#39;t think they&#39;re online anywhere public at the moment, though, at least not that I know of. The good news is we&#39;ve been talking about putting all his stuff on The Lost Tales, so it&#39;s together.

            <p>So, I have a bit of problem regarding Sues. See, I&#39;m on Deviant Art. I &quot;watched&quot; someone on there because she was a Trekkie like me. She was a good artist, but I kept getting journal alerts and art alerts that featured an android OC named Catherine Evergreen who gets with Data. Sue-y, but I just ignored it.<br>Then this came into my message inbox: <a href="http://ladydata.deviantart.com/#/d5llnd2"><a href="http://ladydata.deviantart.com/#/d5llnd2">http://ladydata.deviantart.com/#/d5llnd2</a></a><br>She makes some good points, but some of the rant is classic denial (Sure she&#39;s smart and talented and beautiful and gets with a canon character, but she&#39;s not a Sue!!!)<br>So, should I let it pass me by like everything else she&#39;s done about this character, or should I find a really polite way to tell her the truth?</p>

            <p>Ask the author why the character needs one trait or the other. The character&#39;s traits should be relevant to the story, or else they don&#39;t need to be mentioned. For example, if the character is beautiful, does that drive the story--or is it just something cool you wanted to give them? Does it change the way the character thinks of herself, perhaps to make her more arrogant, or to make her question people&#39;s motives when they are obviously attracted to her looks? Does it make her stand out from others in a part of the story where that gets her targeted by someone who values looks? Or perhaps she is the sort of person who simply enjoys looking good, spends time on grooming, and feels better when she&#39;s stylishly dressed; an artistic sort of beauty; maybe she uses her sense of style to catch someone&#39;s eye or to give a friend a makeover to take the edge off a bad day. There are many things you can do with beauty, but you shouldn&#39;t just be making your character beautiful for no real reason.<br><br>Similarly: Intelligence or talent. Your character&#39;s abilities should be relevant to the story. If you&#39;re writing about a gifted child, that giftedness should be part of what drives the plot. If you&#39;re writing about a skilled swordsman, he should be skilled not because it&#39;s &quot;cool&quot; but because your story requires a skilled swordsman for the role. The character&#39;s unique traits and abilities should change the way she reacts to the world around her, and thus change the way the story plays out.<br><br>Even negative characteristics should be there for a reason. Don&#39;t just make your character clumsy and then not do anything with it. Does she trip at a critical moment? Does she stay away from things requiring physical grace because she&#39;s afraid of embarrassing herself? Or if you make your character mean-spirited, that trait needs to get her into trouble, have real consequences, and not just disappear when it&#39;s convenient.<br><br>It&#39;s a sort of Occam&#39;s razor for characters: The simplest character necessary to fill the role is probably the best. But &quot;simple&quot; does not mean &quot;flat&quot;. A character is presumed to have a lot more traits than you describe; it&#39;s just that if you don&#39;t use a trait somehow, you don&#39;t need to give it to the character, because it&#39;s not relevant to the story.</p>

            <p>I always find it bloody ridiculous how badly some people can take constructive criticism to the point where they refuse to entertain the idea that their character verges on Suedom.<br><br>But what I find even more ridiculous is how eager others are to leap to their defence and say oh no, they&#39;re not Sues, they&#39;re just interesting people! And... uh... most times those others create Sues of their own, so really, I rather doubt their ethos in those sorts of arguments.<br><br>Speaking as an ex-Suethor I just wish more people were ready to admit that their character might need work or more ready to submit their own characters to scrutiny. I did it rather regularly with the cast of IAHF back when I was still writing it; Jennifer barely avoided Suedom in the form of a messy love quadrangle, for example, which one of my regular readers had the decency to point out to me.<br><br>It really depends on how ticked off you get by the Suethor. Any course of action you may take may play out favourably or not, but it&#39;s still your call. If it were me and my short temper and patience with Suethors in denial, I&#39;d spork the heck out of it. But since I know I have no saintly patience with these sorts of people, I would advise you against doing the same.<br><br>...I have Jane Eyre on the mind, sorry.</p>

            <p>It <i>is</i> painful. Which is why I feel like trying to do something about it. I feel like because I sort of know her I might have some influence.

            <p>From what I&#39;ve experienced people like this can be very stubborn about this sort of thing. My advice would be to not directly tell her that her stories need work, but to pose innocent-seeming questions like &quot;I wonder how Catherine managed to time travel like that?&quot; (Note: I&#39;m not very familiar with Star Trek, so I have no idea if this is a usual thing) or &quot;Wow, how does Catherine manage to be so popular with the guys? I can&#39;t get one guy to even look at me!&quot; People like this need to be let down gently, when you&#39;re critiquing her don&#39;t use sarcasm or make a snarky remark because then she&#39;ll just think you&#39;re being mean. After she&#39;s settled down for a bit maybe casually suggest that you can beta-read for her, because I’ve noticed that there are quite a few mistakes. Above all, don&#39;t provoke her; people hate it when you say that something that they believe is wrong, no matter how wrong it might actually be.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a Sue alright. A big, fat Sue.<br><br>But I wouldn&#39;t do anything about it. If LadyData wants to write, fine. She wants to rant? Fine. But when it&#39;s ranting like this, simple words won&#39;t get through to her. <br><br>Maybe talk to her in a month or so, once they&#39;ve cooled off.

            <p>Having been in several of DeviantART&#39;s rage groups in the last year - which I am no longer a part of, and am only on DeviantART to express my works - I can safely say that this kind of person, who is so in denial that it hurts to read, is better left to their own devices. Somebody else will throw the first punch, trust me.<br><br>Starting a debate about Mary Sues with a person like this will inevitably lead to a full-on flame war between opposing parties. Depending on how loyal the white knights are, this could go on for Weeks or months, and eventually will degrade into spite-directed trolling of both parties involved. I&#39;ve seen people on DA deactivate their accounts over something like that, because it just gets downright FILTHY after a while.<br><br>Bottom line: not worth it. Don&#39;t waste your time - just enjoy her works and ignore the journals, and try not to get too disgruntled over the Sue, because it&#39;s one Sue that I don&#39;t recommend you try and spork.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d honestly be more troubled if this story was on fanfiction, but let&#39;s face it, Deviant Art writing is a smaller audience and is going to cater primarily to like-minded people. It&#39;s probably not worth being in a flame war over, especially when you&#39;ve got your own account and stuff. <br><br>Plus, Deviantart is a place that I&#39;d initially peg for flame wars getting outright nasty - it&#39;s a bit like the sims community in that a lot of people get a disproportionate influence because they&#39;re good at making things, and then they get inflated egos from people praising their writing because of their popularity or talent in another feild, when the writing turns out to be subpar. They don&#39;t take being brought back down to earth or honesty about their writing ability very well... also, Deviant Art has a &quot;secrets&quot; thing going, which can turn nasty, and any anonymous &quot;secrets&quot; organization is likely to take any sort of mildly interesting spat and blow it out of proportion. Basically, I&#39;m agreeing with Specs, but with some extra information to clarify things about my opinions. I might be over-cautious about this, but I&#39;ve seen flame-wars go on for <i>years</i> in mixed-media (writing and pictures) communities just because someone dared to point out that the popular person actually didn&#39;t write as well as everyone said they did and people were just currying favor so that this person would possibly make them something. (Sims machinima and CC community, I&#39;m looking at you.)<br><br>On a much lighter note, the presence of triple exclamation marks and the overall tone of the journal makes me think that this person is not psychologically mature enough to take an objective look at her own work and admit that people  are taking issue with the quality of the characterization. The kind of constructive criticism and growth that might lead her to write better isn&#39;t going to be found on Deviantart, because she&#39;s going to keep getting praised for her art and people are going to extend that to her writing, and attempt to make themselves more popular by hanging out online with her. <br><br>I think her last stamp says it all: she doesn&#39;t know what it means, she just sees a personal attack. It seems like everyone else that commented sees it as a personal attack as well.</p>

            <p>About those rage groups I mentioned? Well, to further Seven&#39;s point about things going off the handle, I learned, trolling and flaming techniques - from them. I&#39;m sad to admit it, but I used to be one of the worst of their kind, and would screen cap anything I deemed worthy of being slammed and just rail at it with red ink.<br><br>When I said somebody else will throw the first punch, I really meant that a rage group would get her eventually. Her kind of behavior does not pass by the eyes of the vengeful vigilantes and trolls of DA, because they feed on other people&#39;s misery and expressly seek it out. <br><br>In fact, at one point in a rage group I frequented, an event was organized to break up a chat-room wedding role play. I didn&#39;t participate, because my conscience wouldn&#39;t let me in good faith, but I went to watch the bloodbath. Oh. My. God. That&#39;s one chat room that never came back to life after it was destroyed.<br><br>Now that I think on it, I think the best way to convert the hard news to her would be through private notes, and not open messages where you&#39;ll be subject to attack.</p>

            <p>... to what a very small group of people used to do within the sims community. (Probably why a lot of our older members left, to be honest.) The criteria was a little different, because these people wanted to enforce that it was okay for them to write badly because sims writing wasn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; writing and people with actual care and talent were the ones constantly under attack (as well as anybody who created custom content who had been getting attention that the trolls were jealous of,) but basically they&#39;d take a post much more honest and well thought-out than that and take it further out of context than a news anchor on a talk show. <br><br>I&#39;m actually starting to feel quite sorry for your net-acquaintance if and when the inevitable firefight <i>does</i> break out, because white knights or no, if she keeps making a fuss about a relatively harmless spork on a sues page, she <i>will</i> get troll attention in a big way. So will her defenders, most likely. <br><br>(See, those sporking and sue pages are good because they <i>channel</i> people&#39;s urge to tear apart a work, but since they have rules to prevent personal attacks and to vent people&#39;s rage over ignorance in ways that are designed not to go directly back to the author, they don&#39;t degrade as easily into all-out ad hominem attacks and trolling. At least, when they&#39;re run well they don&#39;t. Come to think of it, the PPC serves the same function in a way - attacking a work that we can&#39;t countenance, either because of the author&#39;s ignorance/blatant button-pushing or because of the use of bad spelling, grammar, and logic - <i>without</i> venting any spleen directly upon the author, a handful of sarcastic comments aside.)<br><br>Anyhow, that&#39;s enough amateur psychology from me - can you believe I&#39;m technically studying archaeology and chemistry? I just felt like getting that out there because I don&#39;t want you to get sucked into something with such a potential to get ugly, since I learned that the hard way over in the sims community - places with anonymous &quot;secrets&quot; threads seem to perpetuate hateful trolling and gossip, and I&#39;ve seen both eager, bright young things and established members of the community get sucked in on both sides of the fence and chewed up and spit back out. Your DA aquaintance has been sporked - if she&#39;s lucky, she&#39;ll mature a bit sooner or later and won&#39;t become a troll target. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the &quot;nice&quot; approach was getting through to her. The person running the &quot;Star Trek Mary Sues&quot; blog was very polite and kind, explaining the general reason the characters were classified as Mary Sues, but Lady Data just uses it as a way to rant about &quot;My characters are super pretty and smart and it&#39;s hurtful to call someone&#39;s character a Mary Sue just because you don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s written.&quot; <br><br>She defends her characters with the traits that were pointed out to be Sueish, so I don&#39;t think she really understands what people are trying to say is that her characters still need development, not that people just don&#39;t like them. If you clarify that for her first, you might get through to her more. And add details, like how she was randomly time traveling, instead of just saying &quot;This needs work&quot;.<br><br>*Takes a big breath, then dives back into NaNo story.* </p>

            <p>Do you feel like getting into a debate and possibly alienating this person?<br><br>Having read the post and a bit of the discussion in the replies, I agree she&#39;s in denial. I am greatly amused by the part where she says she&#39;s not writing to fulfill some fangirl fantasy and then goes on to describe her desire to see Data in a happy relationship, and the part where she says she&#39;s writing a beautiful, smart character to get away from stereotypes. Oh, and how all her past relationships have sucked because the men only wanted her for sex, which somehow makes her not Sueish (&quot;cursed with beauty,&quot; anyone?).<br><br>So... the question really is how much energy you feel like putting into it, and whether you think it&#39;s worth it.

            <p>It&#39;s nice to see a new mission with The Fisherman and Evie, especially killing a badfic like this! (I know of said fic from the Elmer Studios MSTing site, where they tore into it.)<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to see more with these two!</p>

            <p>Really liked the mission. A Sparklewolf keeping mini-Rachiels togeter like they were sheeps was a fun image.<br><br>I want to know what is it with uber-overpowered Sues and Stus lately, though. They are popping out everywhere, and killing them is a pain.</p>

            <p>Or at least, in action currently, as I&#39;m not sure if I was around when you were last here. If not, hi! I&#39;m ThatOne! Have some candy! <br><br>I&#39;m really fond of your missions, especially the dynamic between The Fisherman and Evie and I have to say, even though I know next to nothing about Evangelion, the mission was very enjoyable to read. (The fact that I was using it to procrastinate working on my NaNoWriMo story probably contributes to that.)<br><br> I can definitely see Bleep-bananas becoming popular. <br><br>&quot;The same memory erasing you love with the added bonus of actual flavor and potassium!

            <p>The pacing in this mission is excellent.  The action keeps moving right along, showing the reader everything the badfic does wrong and why it&#39;s wrong, and getting to the climax without bogging down anywhere along the way.  I like that the agents&#39; identities as a Time Lord and a GLaDOS-clone are shown off and discussed just a bit, without it interrupting the flow of the mission.<br><br>I do admit that I&#39;m not quite clear on the role that demons and angels normally play in this continuum.  It sort of seems like angels are usually the bad guys?  I wouldn&#39;t have minded some more info on that, and the nature of the Eva robots.<br><br>I particularly enjoyed the fight scene at the end, especially the dialogue you gave the Sue, and Evie&#39;s responses, which kept it from becoming a giant punch-fest.  It was especially nice that Issei showed off personality traits of both angels and Sues, there.<br><br>A few typos:<br>&quot;<b>There</b> space inside the device shimmered and a standard hunting-type knife materialised.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The purple Unit <b>hang</b> in place, retrieved its pistol and blew the demon’s head to pieces before falling back to Earth without a scratch.&quot;<br><br>There are also a bunch of Вs floating around throughout the mission.  I suspect they&#39;re the result of coding wonk, since they all seem to show up at the start of a new paragraph, or where a comma should have been.  An Edit-Find search should show them all.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I&#39;m glad you liked it! :)<br><br>As for the explanation of Evangelions and Angels, yeah, re-reading the mission it does seem like it&#39;d be unclear to those unfamiliar with NGE. I&#39;ll see if I can go back and add in a pinch of exposition in a couple of appropriate places. If you haven&#39;t already, have a read of <a href="http://fish-custard.webs.com/youhavenotarrived.htm">the previous interlude</a> for a little back story on the PPC&#39;s own Eva unit.<br><br>Basically in the series humanity comes under attack by &#39;Angels&#39;, freaky reality-warping monsters that can only be combated by the giant biomechs known as Evangelions (Angels can generate an energy barrier called an AT-field that repels normal attacks, Evas neutralise the field and fight the thing in close combat).<br><br>These units in turn can only be piloted by certain 14-year-old kids (yeah, I know). There&#39;s more to it than that, it&#39;s a heavily psychological/character-based series, but that&#39;s the basic setup.<br><br>Canonically there are 17 Angels in the series (hence Issei being the supa speshul 18th one), and most certainly no demons/devils. All that will go on the wiki page about the series that I need to create.<br><br>Thanks for catching those errors - typos and stray HTML entities zapped. <sup>_^</sup></p>
