            <p>The way I looked at this badfic, the actual act of trans-dimsensional haopping, and the anachronisms brought along, were the main source of the canon warping.  The Sue, while being an inconsiderate brat, didn&#39;t really do much on her own, so assassinating her wasn&#39;t strictly necessary to fix canon.<br><br>In fact, you could even read the mission to be a Despatch-style one about a badfic author from the <i>Holmes</i> world, writing real person fic about a historical figure.  I intentionally left that a bit ambiguous.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m wondering...how <i>do</i> you pronounce Dafydd&#39;s name? I&#39;ve been pronouncing it &quot;Davith&quot;, am I right?<br>I also recently caught up on reading his missions. I liked them a lot. Even read the &quot;Celebrian&quot; sporking and liked it, which is just a testament to how good the sporking was. <br>I&#39;d like to learn more about Marrissa Picard--I only see one mission on the wiki. And also, do you happen to know why My Immortal hasn&#39;t been sporked yet? Did it scare the agents off like &quot;Subjugation&quot;?<br>Liked the video, I hope you make more starring Dafydd.</p>

            <p>Yes, that is how you pronounce &quot;Dafydd&quot;; he even says so on the video, and the pronunciation is also given in at least one of Agent Illian&#39;s missions.<br><br>My Immortal hasn&#39;t been sporked because it has been generally judged to be one of the trolliest trolls to ever troll, and we are not generally in the business of sporking intentional badfic. We just keep it around because of its infamy value. :p (Although speaking of bad fanfic, I have recently been tempted by the idea of trying to kill off Rose Potter.)</p>

            <p>At the moment it&#39;s just an idea; I&#39;m not making any concrete preparations yet.

            <p>I just wanted to ask, really quick here...<br><br>What&#39;s up with the Obama Hate-Fest suddenly springing up?<br><br>I mean, I&#39;m no Obama fan, sure, but these... Huge articles of records about his religious hatreds of sorts are starting to pop up, unannounced, in the wrong discussions, with titles that do little to reflect the post.<br><br>It&#39;s starting to worry me. Both KittyNoodles and Lily Winterwood have, supposedly, posted the big articles under previously-used post titles, at extremely inconvenient times and inappropriate places.<br><br>The problem is, Kitty isn&#39;t even online - she&#39;s asleep - and Lily hasn&#39;t hardly said anything all day outside of a happy birthday and a few sparse replies.<br><br>Somebody please tell me we&#39;re not being hacked.</p>

            <p>...all joking aside, the Jarate/Bushwaka combo is possibly one of the most potent combos a CQC Sniper can have. Jarate a guy and bludgeon him to death with your almighty crit-blade or use your primary to finish him off. Even the mighty Heavy will die in two hits from this attack... so long as he isn&#39;t overhealed.<br><br><br>But that&#39;s noting compared to the amounts of rage generated by the Sydney Sleeper. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m the world&#39;s worst Spiper, so I usually run Sydney Sleeper- Jarate - Bushwaka for long-distance fights or Huntsman- Jarate - Bushwaka for CQC. I do assists and body shots, not proper sniping...<br><br>As a Soldier or Demoman, the stock weapons are so beautifully balanced it&#39;s a shame to use anything else (Buff Banner is acceptable if you have a competent team).

Frontier Justice is way too situational for my tastes so I just stick to the stock primary and secondaries. Wrenches, on the other hand... I usually run Southern Hospitality for defence and Jag/Gunslinger for offense. <br><br>The only thing you need for the Medic is the Ьbersaw. Accept no substitutes! <br><br>I don&#39;t play Pyro much so I can&#39;t really advise anyone on that.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to talk about my Spy gameplay.

            <p>My best kill ever was as a Spy, however. I was playing pn this Mario Kart 2 V30 map, where there is a control point on a part of the map that can be reached only by spawning there or falling into two well-hidden portals into the map.<br><br>The portals put you on some kind of tall, thin hill a few meters from the CP, and the server where I was playing had the goomba mechanic (jump on an enemy&#39;s head from high enough and you get an insta-kill.)<br><br>I once went there through portal, and found three enemy Scouts on the CP. They didn&#39;t see me, but trying to engage them with normal means would have been a suicide.<br><br>So, I said &quot;Screw it&quot;, and decided to attempt to goomba at least one of them.<br><br>As a successful goomba shoots you back in the air, I found myself being able to stomp all three of them without them even noticing.<br><br>Triple goomba. Too bad that a Soldier blew me into bits while I was taunting.<br><br>(The server where I played is the angrynewbs mario kart 24/7 one. Very good if you want to try out a loadout or just want to kill stuff without worrying about teamwork or the goal of the map. I am playing there a lot lately.)</p>

Nobody plays Engineer or Medic when we really need one on the team (usually there&#39;s four derpy spies running around and getting themselves killed instead) so I&#39;m almost always seen as a support player. Pyro is fun too, but the W+M1 (walk forward and spam flamethrower) mentality is still strong with the new players. When they learn to airblast properly Pyros can curbstomp Soldiers and Demomen. Puff-and-sting (light enemy on fire, whack them with the crit-axe) still strikes fear into the hearts of many if executed by a good Pyro.<br><br>If your computer can handle it, TF2 is free to play. Just download the Steam client, download TF2 and you&#39;re good to go. Sure, you might only get 50 backpack slots for your weapons but the game is so worth it it doesn&#39;t even matter. All weapons are very well balanced and the only thing that separates new players from the old guard is skill.</p>

Rose is an elf raised by humans. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find her in a river and she decides to help find their friends. Later on, she makes the decision to accompany them throughout their journey. Will she learn to trust again? Will her spirit remain free, or will love trap it?&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s not <i>badly</i> written, the grammar and punctuation looks reasonable (though I haven&#39;t gone through the whole thing).  But the idea of an elf raised as a human but still better at &quot;elven&quot; abilities than Legolas just doesn&#39;t fit.</p>

            <p>Agreed, it&#39;s not terribly written. The logic, on the other hand... ow. &gt;.<br>Yes, because Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli are totally going to divert their HIGHLY time-sensitive pursuit to mess around with some random chick sitting in a river. That makes perfect sense. Oh, but wait—they <i>do</i> remember they&#39;re on a highly time-sensitive chase. So they take off and expect her to keep up if she wants to go with them. Some random girl without even her own clothes to wear, who is human for all they know at that point, and not one of your hardy Ranger types, either. Riiight. Smooth.<br><br>They ought to know she&#39;s an elf just by looking at her anyway. They&#39;re, y&#39;know, preternaturally beautiful and perfect and stuff. It would take a lot of work to make one of the Eldar appear mortal. &#39;Course, I also question just what she&#39;s doing there in the first place. What happened to her parents, what were they doing there, where did they come from, etc.?<br><br>And that&#39;s all before she starts manifesting her speshul Mary Sue powers.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how sporkable this is, given the relatively good writing, but it definitely deserves some attention.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>To answer your question about the Portal and Half-Life connection, both games take place in the same universe and are actually pretty involved in each other. The events of Portal happen sometime after the Seven Hour War (where Earth and its defenders get ROFLstomped by the highly advanced Combine war machine) and Portal 2 is set an indeterminate number of years later. The <i>Borealis</i>, an Aperture Science research vessel, is mentioned in Half-Life 2: Episode 2 as a major plot point.<br><br>Black Mesa and Aperture were bitter rivals in universe. Fun fact: you can see a Gravity Gun and a HEV suit charger in Aperture&#39;s labs in the Lab Rat comic, both of which are Black Mesa/Postwar technologies.<br><br>/fanboyism and TMI</p>

The chances of accidentally offending someone are too high.<br><br>I&#39;m Christian myself, and yet I was really, really horrified by that. You know, it&#39;s supposed to be a religion about <i>love, tolerance and good deeds</i><br><br>Good thing it&#39;s long gone, &#39;cause I was so angered by that at the time that if they had killed some of my favourite character I would have been ready to <i>get my permission revoked and leave the community just to spork the living daylights out of it.</i><br><br>Good thing that JulyFlame talked some sense into me before a Prayer Warriors fic about killing Card Captor Sakura ever appeared.</p>

            <p>I grant that there was an instance of a human being raised by elves - Aragorn, I believe the name is? (Or, at least, he&#39;s very well affiliated with elves.)<br><br>But he&#39;s still human, and very much outclassed by Legolas in certain fields, because there are just some things humans can not do that elves can. <br><br>And being raised one way and born the other has an interesting way of negating the latter&#39;s effects on the child in question. While it isn&#39;t impossible for an elf to be raised human, odds are that she wouldn&#39;t just pick up on her ancestry like that and just totally roll with it. <br><br>And just the notion of joining the Fellowship is a call back to the original series - every single instance of a character and the Fellowship being involved together ended badly, as I recall it.<br><br>I imagine this will be duly sporked soon enough, and I will only gladly read the results.</p>

            <p>I honestly don&#39;t get it. It seems like it&#39;s trying to come off like a teen girls&#39; magazine (not bashing, but the quizzes and stuff seem like they could be found in a back issue of COSMOgirl,) and the summaries of the stories on there have SPAG and various errors out the wazoo... both the originals and the fanfiction. <br><br>It just seems like the overall site quality is consistently bad (at least from my brief overview.)<br><br>I vote we call it the circle of lemmings.</p>

            <p>Whew, I never though I&#39;d see so many Real Person fics in one place at the same time. Justin Bieber and this One Direction band seem to be getting the most attention, as does Harry Potter and Twilight. <br><br>It&#39;s like the Pit, but with a heavy emphasis on original love/relationship stories.

It&#39;s yet another &quot;OMG waht would happen if there wuz &amp;other person who survived teh Killing Curse n she wuld meet harry n Draco n stuff?!&quot; but there&#39;s something special about this one that makes it Intel-worthy in my opinion.

            <p>If you were going to build a boyfriend, why would you want a virtual one? I don&#39;t even... I think it&#39;s Sturgeon&#39;s law for sure, but since Sturgeon was never that specific about where to find the 90%, I&#39;m going to assume that this is part of the 90% of fanfic.

            <p>I can barely justify triple citizenship -- say a married couple, one German citizen and one French citizen, on holiday in the US when the baby decides it doesn&#39;t wanna wait nine months.  (And odds are the kidlet would end up assigned to just one of the countries so he could get the paperwork to go home with Mommy and Daddy.)  But quadruple citizenship?  I&#39;m not a lawyer, but I don&#39;t think it works that way.</p>

            <p>Please, step away from the bespectacled psychopath!<br><br>Okay, so this will be my first attempt. Hope I got this all right...<br><br> Specs McGlasses:<br><br>Specs is a creation from the mind of SC, who Specs still refers to as Creator despite several times being told not to. Specs earned his name from a key detail, wherein the removal of his trademark glasses, for any reason, caused him to burst into flames. It was suspected at the time that the Laws of Comedy were toying with him, and so to avoid such travesty, his glasses were fitted with Velcro so that they wouldn&#39;t accidentally slip.<br><br>After discovering that Specs seemed to physically react to the expression of SC&#39;s emotions, and that the effect was tripled when the two were close together - again, likely due to the Laws of Comedy - SC kicked Specs out of his house for his protection, and Specs moved into a small apartment. Before he was kicked out, SC gave Specs a Cool Sword that, until recently, never left Specs&#39; side. <br><br>One fateful day in May (it was actually June, but Specs liked rhymes), Sef appeared in Specs&#39; room from a rift in reality. After some time living together, Specs gave up his Cool Sword to Sef, along with a pair of guns stolen from Specs&#39; past that he had been given by SC via discreet shipping, and the two parted ways. Only, of course, to reunite in the PPC, of all places, in the Department of Floaters.<br><br>---<br><br>Sapphire &quot;Sef&quot; St. Claire:<br><br>Originally a mercenary-for-hire Stu from the Black Cat continuum, employed by Chronos to combat Creed Diskense and his Apostles of the Stars, Sef was soon hit by a heavy dose of Phlebotinum which left its mark in the form of a hyperspace arsenal in his head. It was at this point, along with trying to cope with having such a dreadful name, that Sef felt his patience run out. Soon after, he rebelled against his Stuthor and cast himself out of the continuum by breaking the laws of physics and hiding inside his own arsenal - made possible due to bad author logic. <br><br>Sef, unconscious from his own actions, ended up falling out of his arsenal in the residence of Specs, who decided that weirder things had occurred before (such as spontaneously combusting when his glasses were removed) and took him in. Along with giving Sef his nickname, Specs also gave Sef his Cool Sword and a pair of cross-shaped guns - which had been confiscated from a Sue from Specs&#39; past - to keep. The idea was that Sef should temper the use of his arsenal and only employ it when no other solution was presentable to him. Following this advice, Sef learned to adapt to a more human way of living and all but forgot about his powers - to the point where many of them disappeared altogether. Looking for vengeance against Suethors, Sef soon joined the PPC. The greatest irony was that he was placed in the same response center as Specs. <br><br>Of course, as Sef learned the hard way, it&#39;s never a good idea to tempt the Ironic Overpower.<br><br>---<br><br>Permission piece: <a href="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/258/3/a/records_of_the_lost_acropolis___alistair__s_speech_by_specstacularsc-d5ers3x.html">A Brief Story Excerpt</a><br><br>First fic to spork: &quot;Tales of Vesperia 2: The Blastia Age Restored&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>*Praying frantically that I didn&#39;t screw up*</p>

            <p>My feeling is that I&#39;d like to see you hang around long enough to settle down a bit before getting Permission. Enthusiasm is good, but I kinda feel like you&#39;ve been loading the Board with lots of one-line references to memes and your own work. Since I don&#39;t want to see missions colored heavily with references to memes and your own work (where your avatar is God, I think?), I&#39;m leery of a yes here, especially with these agents. One has a history of getting shiny presents directly from his author, and the other one is defined as a walking vending machine for powerful weapons. You say he won&#39;t use it, but in that case, why even put it there? How often will there be &quot;no other solution&quot; but to tap into it? And Specs&#39; glasses—bursting into flame when he takes them off is not a Law of Narrative Comedy, it&#39;s random chaos. It&#39;s important to know the difference, because random does not necessarily equal funny. This is a common misconception.<br><br>I&#39;m just... very leery. On top of what VM has already noted, I think a &quot;not right now&quot; is appropriate. I&#39;d like to see you read more missions, settle in, and maybe come up with a pair of agents that don&#39;t seem so heavily inclined toward big guns and shiny swords that come from On High, okay?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Bad logic indeed: it practically fuels the PPC, at least the parts that don&#39;t run off of comedy or phlebotinum.<br><br>The story <i>does</i> seem to be a little short, especially for five characters to be popping up in. Plus, I don&#39;t know where any of the people are - I assume they&#39;ve found a generic table because it seems like they&#39;re sitting down. <br><br>Also: the word condone. I&#39;m not sure it means what you think it means, or at least that it should be used where you&#39;re using it. For example<br><br>&quot;I practice magic, but condone its practice as training for megalomaniacal buffoons.&quot;<br><br>To condone is neither to approve of something nor to disapprove, but to overlook it even though some might find it objectionable. It&#39;s like an old west sheriff looking the other way while his nephew busts some heads in a saloon brawl. In this paragraph, you used the word in a way that doesn&#39;t fit the structure of the sentence. There&#39;s no conflict between practicing magic and condoning the use of it, so the word &quot;but&quot; shouldn&#39;t be used in that context. In addition, the tone of magic being &quot;training for megalomaniacal buffoons,&quot; doesn&#39;t fit with the idea that the character is condoning it either. (Also, context as to <i>why</i> he has these opinions on magic might have helped.) Logically, it&#39;s hard for a person to condone their own actions - the condoner would have to be someone <i>else</i> who turned a blind eye to the proceedings. <br><br>(One wonders how you get a whisky flask into a tabard - the last one I saw had no pockets - but that&#39;s neither here nor there.)<br><br>Unfortunately, aside from all that, the dialogue felt kind of stilted. The phrasing is a bit off to require so many commas, and the order and flow of the sentences doesn&#39;t come off as someone talking or even someone trying to talk in an old-fashioned manner. It seems like someone trying to puzzle out a seventeenth or eighteenth-century letter. On top of that, the actions that go with the dialogue don&#39;t seem to fit with it, probably because I&#39;m having a hard time parsing the dialogue and it&#39;s meaning to begin with. I&#39;m not seeing much emotion from your characters, or any personal choices in regards to how they talk and act.<br><br>I do <i>like</i> the message of &#39;I am human, who are you to criticize,&#39; but it lost a lot of impact in delivery since the sentence was tangled up and didn&#39;t show tone. I also don&#39;t know enough about <i>any</i> of the non-speaking characters to appreciate why this is a revelation for them.<br><br>It seems like you got stuck on large words. You don&#39;t need to bring us thesaurus boquets to prove you love us. :)<br><br>In the future I&#39;d pick a longer scene with some movement or a less formal tone - you did much better with the agent bios, probably because you weren&#39;t trying to write in an old-fashioned manner and because the humorous nature of, say, Specs&#39; glasses-removal problem goes a long way towards helping words like &quot;wherein&quot; get along with the rest of the sentence.<br><br>Good luck, SC. :)</p>

I mean, until I realized that it was physically impossible to justify, he had a shield that he pulled out his back end.)<br><br>All said and done, thanks for the input.</p>

            <p>No, because that particular story is one of my more serious ones in the works, but that would be hilarious otherwise.<br><br>I had a similar idea in one of my more, uh... Dark stories, let&#39;s say. The main character in question becomes able to stash weapons in his shirt, at the expense of becoming even more deeply infected by the skin-defiling disease he is cursed with.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;ve written things that disturb me but it&#39;s usually on a psychological scale. (Such as, I had an undeniable urge to write fanfiction for <i>The Cask of Amontillado</i> around haloween, and it disturbed me that I was putting that much mental effort into empathizing with the dude who walled somebody else up in a crypt... and the story I wrote about a serial killer who legitimately thinks he&#39;s just killing ghosts, which was... yeah.) Mostly I manage to creep myself out with the craziness of the people <i>in</i> the stories.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I have to agree with Des and SevenSwans on that - there&#39;s really nothing I can say about your piece with the length as it is. It does feel a bit clunky, the dialogue a bit forced, and I found it tough to follow.

            <p>Although that is definitely longer, and lacks the issues mentioned in the original reply, it sort of doesn&#39;t tell me much about your writing style. You&#39;ve got mainly dry background context - it reads more like a textbook than a story of any sort.<br><br>But I didn&#39;t want to pass judgement on that alone, since I suspect your nerves are misleading you - so I followed a given link to your Deviant Art profile. You&#39;ve got some good styles going on there, you&#39;ve got a good grasp on syntax, spelling, grammar, and in general your writing is of good quality.<br><br>There is a bit of an issue there, though. The content of the pieces doesn&#39;t bother me (We mainly write fictionalized assassins, here, as you may have noticed; very few of us are really aversive to gore, violence, and/or twisted plot elements in general.) But at the beginning of one of your stories, you&#39;ve got a summary telling people not to bother correcting your mediocre writing skills. In another one, you glibly identify one of the characters as a Mary Sue. I do like your writing, for the most part, but I&#39;m really not comfortable granting permission with that being the attitude showcased. If we&#39;re going to go after Sues/Stus, it does not behoove us to go around touting our own writing as work of indifferent quality.<br><br>But... that, too, does not seem strong enough for me to outright turn this down. So alas, after all that, I&#39;m going to abstain and wait for another PG to weigh in. Sorry, Specs.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s all good.

I&#39;m a Harry Potter and Hunger Games fan too, and I&#39;ve been meaning to watch Supernatural for a while now, but for right now I&#39;m behind on my novel for NaNoWriMo so I really should be concentrating on that instead.

Is it any good?<br><br>Also, TOS - I confess I haven&#39;t seen all that much of that. I&#39;m more of a <i>Voyager</i> person, although that was quite a while back, now. I do enjoy <i>First Contact</i>, though, and the latest film and <i>Nemesis</i> were good. I also got a fair bit of Trek rubbed off from my friends at university.</p>

Instead, please enjoy this basket of complimentary antivenins.<br><br>It seems you are an old hand at general nerdery!  Most impressive!Hopefully, there will be many opportunities to discuss fandom things with you!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been working on this collection for a while. The original idea boiled up in my head over a year ago, around the time a bevy of missions were published where the agents all narrowly escaped brushes with dangerous Sues and Stus. Escaping danger is all very well and good, I remember thinking, but this was approaching silly levels. And not good silly, either.<br><br>We&#39;ve built up the PPC&#39;s foes as being larger-than-life reality warpers. Surely not every mission can end with clever wit and pluck winning the day. Surely there must be casualties.<br><br>These stories are in reaction to that. These stories follow agents as they try to cope with losing their friends and loved ones.<br><br>WARNING: This is not your typical light-hearted PPC fare.

            <p>I enjoyed how each short story integrated Kьbler-Ross&#39; five stages of grief into its theme. Character interactions are well-written and give insight into each character&#39;s personality. Descriptions set up the mood and stage perfectly for the action.<br><br>The short sentences and narrative style in the first story greatly contributed to the theme of <i>Denial</i>. For that reason I think I&#39;m going to declare it my favourite short story of the five, though <i>Depression</i> made quite an impression on me. <br><br>Hats off to you, sir. </p>

            <p>This is some very heavy stuff, but I like it.  I agree that agents wouldn&#39;t get off scotch-free if the PPC were less humor-oriented and more realistic; of course, then it wouldn&#39;t quite be the PPC.  But that&#39;s what AUs are for, eh?<br><br>I think  &quot;Anger&quot; and &quot;Depression&quot; hit me the hardest.  &quot;Anger&quot; because of seeing Laura so viciously upset at Danny, and &quot;Despression&quot; because realizing just how much Xericka is relying on Gremlin as her heart is . . . well, heart-breaking.  I hope our universe&#39;s Xericka never has to go through that.  &quot;Acceptance&quot; was probably the least emotionally turbulent for me, because of the time it has separated from the death.  (As well as the bits of hope thrown into it, with Xericka marrying Gremlin (I assume) and adopting another badfic baby.)<br><br>&quot;Denial&quot; is my favorite, due to it depicting Danny&#39;s death in a moment of action.  That action helps to dilute the impact of his death, making it feel a bit more &quot;valuable&quot; to me.  The deaths in the other stories were a bit more difficult to swallow, since they all get mentioned after the fact, and were more sudden and unexpected as a result.  However, I also liked the narrative structure in &quot;Depression,&quot; with Xericka&#39;s purely Nobodyish thoughts interspersed with outside observers&#39; commentary.  Even though it made <i>me</i> feel rather depressed.<br><br>As usual, my obnoxious Pointing-Out-Of-Errors™:<br><br>(&quot;Denial&quot;) She only stopped when <b>he</b> heard the noise from behind her.

            <p>Thank you for your review! I appreciate you taking the time to lay out your thoughts, not to mention find those goofs. Pointing out my errors, no matter how small, is never obnoxious. They&#39;ve been fixed.<br><br>Acceptance was always intended to be the least emotionally troubling (you know, being &#39;Acceptance&#39; and all). Having all five stories be unrelentingly depressing would be a bit much; there needs to be that breather at the end. And yes, Xericka did marry Gremlin. I left it unstated in part because I felt it was pretty obvious to anyone who&#39;s read my spin-offs, but mostly because I couldn&#39;t find a way to put it that didn&#39;t come off as awkwardly phrased.<br><br>Since Danny&#39;s death was such major focal point in Denial, I felt it should be important. An earlier draft sans the leap in front of the bullet just didn&#39;t sit right with me. Besides, sacrificing himself for Laura seemed like a very IC thing for Danny to do. I didn&#39;t dwell in-depth on the others&#39; deaths because it wouldn&#39;t have fit well with what I was trying to do with these stories. The stories are all about those left behind and what they&#39;re going through, not necessarily about the moment of death.<br><br>One last thing I wanted to address, in regards to what you said about the PPC being &quot;less humor-oriented and more realistic; of course, then it wouldn&#39;t quite be the PPC.&quot; One of the other reviews mentioned this as well. I always operated under the impression that the PPC <i>was</i> supposed to be somewhat realistic; having ordinary, relatable agents -- people we the audience are capable of relating to on a personal level -- opposing the over-the-top Sues and Stus. That&#39;s not to say it can&#39;t be funny, but being funny shouldn&#39;t be the only thing. You need calm moments where the agents can relate to each other beyond snarky one-liners.<br><br>I suppose I should also mention Crashing Down, which I would certainly not call a &quot;humor-oriented&quot; story.<br><br>Thank you again for the review. It was much appreciated.</p>

            <p>I guess I meant that we tend towards the light-hearted, rather than avoiding realism altogether.  The agents are essentially fighting a war, but casualties rarely occur on our side, outside of emergencies.  Now, on one hand, missions kind of <i>have</i> to have a happy ending, because in writing missions, we do have an obligation to the published canons to actually fix them, like we&#39;re supposed to.  And I also don&#39;t expect people left and right to kill off their agents after growing attached to them, especially with so many being avatars of their authors.  Still, this removes a level of realism from the setting for me, which makes exploratory writings like this one particularly interesting to me.</p>

            <p>A good something, definitely. Sad and heartwarming and also sad. It&#39;s an interesting look at what things would be like if a) the PPC wasn&#39;t humor-focused and b) authors were more inclined to kill off their agents.

            <p>I have resurfaced from the wreckage of my broken keyboard to request permission. Here we go!<br><br>Requested Division: Department of Floaters, Internship/Freelance<br><br>Agents:<br><br>         Intern Cale Serfe is a haughty teenage girl originally from World One. With dirty blonde hair- often left in a choppy, mussed state- and  grey eyes, she stands at the unimpressive height of one hundred and sixty five centimetres. After learning of the Sue-driven attacks on IAHF&#39;s extensive library, she applied for an internship at the PPC. Once she graduates she plans to join the PPC as a full operative. <br>    Cale is prone to fits of laziness that are signalled by her constant refrain of, “I just want to read,” “leave me here to die,” and “bring me a snack pack.” She has an extensive vicious streak if angered. When her lust objects are threatened- though she denies the existence of such beings- she will seek blood. Throughout the duration of her good moods she is sarcastic, and in a bad mood she can become downright cruel. <br>       Despite this, she is indulgent with those she has taken a liking to. This extends to a near ridiculous level. She will constantly bring them up in conversations and fret over their well-being. This is her general approach to animals, with the exception being cute-animal friends. <br>Cale is a massive hoarder, rivalling Smaug in her selectiveness. She holds a small grudge against her &#39;partner&#39; for being accepted as an agent right away, even though she understands why.<br><br>       Agent Narciss Miner is a generic background troll who Cale recruited from a Sue fic in the Homestuck continuum. She has the standard grey skin, black hair, and horns of her species. Narciss feels very proud of her horns, and will often spend a large amount of time arranging her hair to show them off.<br>    She feels uncomfortable while idle, and tends to keep herself busy at all times. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, she is likely to leap into things without planning ahead.<br>  Narciss grasps most of the PPC standard rules of grammar, and studies them often; however, she is constantly frustrated by the lack of conveying tone through speech patterns. She complains that the absence of a quirk is boring. Her own quirk follows the pattern of the following sentence: I=refuse=tQ=b1ay=these=chi1dish=games=befQre=cQmb1eting=the=missiQn<br>As she does not use end punctuation, she will start sentences on new lines.<br> When Narciss first joined the PPC, Cale dumped a large collection of classic literature on her. She now uses references as curses, explanations, or misdirections in conversations.<br> Narciss is protective of even vague acquaintances as she sees them as extensions of herself. Members of FicPsych have had long, in-depth talks with her on why this is an unhealthy world view, but she is allowed to go on missions so long as she checks in for weekly sessions.<br><br>Permission Fic: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HPQD85klGvSU4pfxGKEFrRZ3kwb-oZOMZbaemHLPLWQ/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HPQD85klGvSU4pfxGKEFrRZ3kwb-oZOMZbaemHLPLWQ/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HPQD85klGvSU4pfxGKEFrRZ3kwb-oZOMZbaemHLPLWQ/edit</a></a><br><br>Badfic Claim: A Homestuck Sue!fic filed under the charming title: Troll the Troll<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7380773/1/Troll-the-Troll"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7380773/1/Troll-the-Troll">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7380773/1/Troll-the-Troll</a></a><br><br>Please tell me if anything is amiss!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not, so I don&#39;t feel comfortable making a final decision. However, I&#39;m leaning toward a &quot;not yet.&quot; Your writing is okay in that the SPaG checks out, but I thought the overall tone was more angry than it was funny (both characters seem to have quite the snooty &#39;tude on them), and I found myself confused about where we were, what was happening, who was speaking, etc., more than I like.<br><br>For instance, I didn&#39;t find out we were in a Suefic before somewhere in the middle of the second page. Up until that point, everything relating to the mission is a past-tense discussion of how it went, so I thought it was over and Cale just had an RC with an odd-colored floor.<br><br>Incidentally, did you know the crash dummies deflate into squishy cubes for storage and transportation?<br><br>Another specific issue I can point to is dialogue attribution. You really, really don&#39;t need a tag for everything, and it can become incredibly redundant, such as in this one:<br><br>- &quot;‘I’m sorry, okay,’ she apologised&quot;<br><br>I could see she was apologizing because she said she was sorry. The narrator didn&#39;t need to tell me that. I was paying attention, I promise.<br><br>That&#39;s the most obvious example, but it comes up elsewhere, too, as in &quot;the troll rationalized&quot;, &quot;she remarked&quot;, &quot;she conceded&quot;, etc. Almost always, such tags are redundant. I know she just rationalized, remarked, or conceded something, because I read the bit where she did it. Context supplies the how and why much better than being told about it.<br><br>For comparison, here&#39;s a good example of well-attributed dialogue:<br><br>- &quot;Cale looked at her, bemused. ‘So you know why I’m here?’&quot;<br><br>The description of Cale&#39;s expression tells me it&#39;s her line of dialogue and supplies everything I need to know about her tone, without any extra &quot;she verbed&quot; bit tacked on the end. It&#39;s clean, efficient, and effective. More like this would be better; or even just &quot;Cale said&quot; if you need to distinguish who&#39;s talking. You can&#39;t go too far wrong with a nice, simple &quot;said.&quot;<br><br>On the other hand, it&#39;s easy to get carried away with huffs and sniffs and snaps and sighs and other extraneous noises. It&#39;s actually very difficult to speak those sounds, particularly the sniff. I dare you to try it sometime. {; P You definitely can&#39;t speak a gesture, as here:<br><br>- &quot;‘Cale, I am so glad you are back. Please, explain to me how the “it oon database” works,’ Narciss gestured towards the console.&quot;<br><br>Also, not to spark another argument about paragraphing, but I would really seriously discourage everyone from writing lines with one person&#39;s actions next to another person&#39;s dialogue. It can get confusing quickly. For instance, take these lines:<br><br>- &quot;Cale glared up at a grey face, which was fixed in a disapproving expression. ‘I did try to get your attention,’ the troll rationalised. Cale moved to rub her thumb against her palm, but stopped in mid-motion. Nervous tics were dead give-aways, and although ‘Professor’ Holmes wasn’t snickering at her currently, she was trying to break the habit before the end of the semester.&quot;<br><br>This dialogue is in the middle of a paragraph all about Cale, so it should be Cale&#39;s dialogue. If the reader doesn&#39;t know the grey face goes with the troll, they&#39;re going to be confused. The problem is compounded when we get to the next paragraph:<br><br>- &quot;‘I thought you were supposed to stay in your “tower”,’ she remarked. The troll snorted, flopping down beside her.&quot;<br><br>Who is speaking here? We just left a Cale paragraph, and a new paragraph signals a new speaker, so it can&#39;t be Cale. But wait, it actually is Cale, even though the troll has an action on that line, which would normally signal that it&#39;s the troll&#39;s dialogue.<br><br>This is a problem because time that the reader spends figuring out what&#39;s going on with the dialogue is time they&#39;re not spending being involved in the story. You want to keep them hooked and not give them any excuse to wander off until you&#39;re good and done, yes? {= )<br><br>Anyway, those are the things that jump out at me. I really think another PG or two should add their two cents, especially since I can&#39;t comment at all on the characterization of the troll.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>With my my two cents about the troll agent, specifically.<br><br>Overall, she&#39;s pretty good.  I like her speech patterns, and I like how you describe her accent shown by her quirk.  Her personality looks good, but could probably be fleshed out a little better. Most of her character bio was taken up describing her quirk.  In fact, her personality in the fic - while good! - didn&#39;t seem to reflect the character bio very well.  Also, some character questions that might help solidify her personality, that most fantrolls state in their intro -  How old is she?  What&#39;s her blood color?  What are some of her interests? And the more PPC-related - Being a bit character, does she remember Alternia at all, and if so, how has that shaped her?<br><br>The two major problems I have are actually the easiest things to fix: her name and her quirk.<br><br>For her name - Narciss Miner.  Troll first and last names, at least when they&#39;re kids, are six letters long.  This is a thing that we can be reasonably sure is universal.  She can be Narcis Minner or Narcis Minerr or even Narcis Sminer.  You could make the argument that the 6/6 thing hasn&#39;t been stated in canon to explicitly and always be true, but I would advise against deviating from the set pattern.<br><br>And second, her quirk.  I really like the idea of the = in the spaces, but the letter replacements seem just awkward enough to make her text difficult to read.  Especially as it&#39;s already got the equals signs, I would advise choosing one letter replacement, not all three.<br><br>Other than that, though, any other nitpicks I have could be explained by &quot;we just haven&#39;t seen enough of her yet.&quot;  For example, I was wondering - in her bio it says she &quot;is protective of even vague acquaintances as she sees them as extensions of herself.&quot;  She doesn&#39;t seem that way at all about Cale or the dead Sue, though.  Is that just because she didn&#39;t like them?  I was a little confused.<br><br>That&#39;s it for serious critique.  If you don&#39;t know Homestuck, the next bit won&#39;t make any sense, and even if you do, it might be overly wordy and boring, but I just wanted to talk about one of my personal pet peeves: misuse of the word &quot;pity.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;d be careful about throwing around the word &quot;pity.&quot;  Only Karkat has ever used the word &quot;pity&quot; for positive feelings.  Terezi, Vriska, Roxy, and the narration all use &quot;pity&quot; to mean the normal human definition of &quot;pity,&quot; and the trolls certainly use the words &quot;love&quot; and &quot;friendship&quot; all the time.  Note that in the incredibly long troll romance exposition, the word &quot;pity&quot; was not used even once.  Most common fandom theory is that Karkat is as full of crap when it comes to romance as Kankri is when it comes to social justice, and his hate/pity stuff is a fringe nutcase theory, if he didn&#39;t come up with it himself.  It would explain why he had to explain it all to Vriska that one time - if it were the standard accepted theory, wouldn&#39;t she know all that already?  (For reference, the word &quot;pity&quot; is used in Act 5 twelve times: it was only used to mean &quot;positive relationships&quot; eight times, and those were all by Karkat, and six of them were in the same conversation with Vriska.  On the other hand, the word &quot;friend&quot; is used by trolls something like 55 times, and &quot;friendship&quot; seven times, in Act 5 Act 1 alone.)(And I know it says &quot;the word for friend is exactly the same as the word for enemy&quot; but that clearly isn&#39;t true. So I don&#39;t know.)<br><br>Not to say you shouldn&#39;t use the word pity.  Obviously &quot;most common fan theory&quot; isn&#39;t canon, not by a long shot.  As it is in the fic, it works just fine - in fact, it was kind of amusing and i liked it - but I would just be careful and use it sparingly, and remember that when you want to talk about friendship and love, use those words - friendship and love.</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t noticed the six letter rule, and I&#39;m glad to learn something new! The quirk was created when my keyboard broke, and I had to type like that for a week. Readability is a big issue, so I&#39;d be happy to revise the quirk.<br>As for the protective bit, Narciss takes an affront to herself in higher priority than anyone in a &quot;lesser&quot; position. <br>Everything else I had planned to address in the wiki entry- provided the agents were accepted- such as Narciss&#39; (or Narcis, now) version of Alternia. My original intent was to put them in the character summary, but it then extended into around nine paragraphs. Sylladex pondering can be Serious Business.<br>Thank you so much for separating Karkat rage from facts. I tend to take anything a character says as fact and that does not seem to work well with Homestuck. Eventually I will learn. <br>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>The first thing I noticed was the tone. It&#39;s clear that Cale has been around the block for a while (appropriate for someone coming from a fanfiction academy - those places can get rough) and she seems to be adjusted well enough to the missions aspect of the PPC to already work through things.<br><br>That&#39;s actually very interesting - an agent who plans things out rather than jumping into a fic with the DORKS and the closest weapon and waiting until they figure they have clearance to kill stuff. Also, it makes for great background to her being an overenthusiastic intern and learning <i>why</i> most people just show up and shoot things. <br><br>I&#39;m supposed to be confused by the troll, right? I don&#39;t know Homestuck. Though, it seems like she&#39;ll make a decent recruit... I&#39;m a little fuzzy on when she learned anything about the PPC (her demands that Cale take her home and such come off as having a rudimentary idea of what the PPC does,) but it seems that they sorted things out. <br><br>I do start to wonder about the contents of the badfic - since I don&#39;t have background for why the two are arguing until they actually <i>start</i> arguing. One nitpick I do have about this is that it seems as if their final argument leaves things very up in the air and ends on an odd note. It doesn&#39;t seem to flow as well as the first half. </p>

            <p>The troll is indeed a continua thing. If you ever have a free week or so and a sudden need for sleep deprivation you can try Homestuck out. <br><br>Being a generic fic troll, and seeing how they usually appear in Sue fics with near exclusivity, I imagined that in her experience PPC agents neutralised the threat and sent everyone else home.<br><br>I am not quite so happy with the second half.<br>It likely has much to do with my very flimsy grasp of Narciss&#39; character so far, and I hope that practice will smooth things out. It may also be affected by the fact that I have spent most of my life trying to avoid arguments, and therefore no nothing of their composition.<br><br>On the awkward atmosphere between the two, that might dissipate as they slip into inevitable passive aggressive warfare.</p>

            <p>Since we&#39;ve just (sometime this year) passed our tenth anniversary - and the tenth anniversary of the Oddlots homepage rebooting is coming up in March - I was thinking:<br><br>Could we make a documentary about the PPC community?<br><br>I&#39;m thinking something that could go up on Youtube (not the TV, obviously), basically outlining a) what the PPC is and b) our history. <i>Not</i> the history of the organisation, though - I&#39;m thinking specifically of the Boards, Chats, Wiki and Websites.<br><br>I&#39;m imagining &#39;interviews&#39; with people from across the history of the PPC - most likely current Boarders/Chatters, but from every year we&#39;ve been around. (I say &#39;interviews&#39; because they&#39;d likely either be Boarder X giving a short spiel, or interviewer/Boarder videos intercut despite being in wildly different places) They wouldn&#39;t even have to be videos - audio with generic silhouette pictures would work, or even other people reading out a written statement.<br><br>I&#39;m also thinking we <i>might</i> be able to get a brief clip out of some departed members - people like, say, Miss Cam, who is still active in fandom, or July, or - hey, anything&#39;s possible - Jay or Acacia themselves.<br><br>I&#39;m <i>not</i> thinking high-budget. I&#39;m considering getting former-Agent Dafydd to act as host (or in other words, me in one of my cloaks), and basically cut between the aforementioned interviews, narration-to-camera, and stills of certain things (websites, for instance). The one thing I&#39;d like but can&#39;t actually do myself - other than interviews - is drawings for some events (Ypur invasions, perhaps?), but that&#39;s filed under &#39;would work without it&#39;.<br><br>I&#39;d think we&#39;d want it to be primarily positive - so we wouldn&#39;t devote large chunks of time to, say, the Thalia Weaver Incident, or the various IRC-related dramas - but also an honest portrayal of Who We Are and Why We&#39;re Here.<br><br>And starting with a reading from <i>Rambling Band</i>, of course.<br><br>But... what does anyone else think? Is there anyone who&#39;d contribute to it - video, audio, written statement or (possibly) art? Or am I just throwing petals into the wind?<br><br>(... is that a saying? It feels like a saying...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>AFAIK, two people start eating at the opposite ends of a Pocky stick (Those thin chocolate-covered biscuits Kyoko from Madoka Magica likes to chomp on. In Europe they are known as &quot;Mikado&quot;, don&#39;t know if there is an American brand too.), and the first who stops to avoid &quot;kissing&quot; the other one loses.
