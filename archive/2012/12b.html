            <p>I started watching it not too long ago, started with the reboot. (My far more dedicated brother started at the very very beginning and I wish him luck with that.) I am now halfway through season 3 and I have a somewhat embarrassing question: is it bad that I find Daleks bizarrely cute?<br><br>Not that I&#39;d actually want to meet one, but... just...<br><br>Okay this Dalek is hooked up to a bunch of wires and he&#39;s got his blinky lights and his eye scope moving around and he&#39;s wagging his little plunger and zappy arms around just enough that his entire metal saltshaker suit is wobbling &quot;I AM NOW READY FOR FULL SCALE WAR&quot; Oh my God why is this so cute.<br><br>I&#39;m kind of itching to try the same thing I did with Jack the Hunter, with a hypothetical Dalek agent (granting &quot;humanity&quot;, basically), but I&#39;m not entirely sure how. I&#39;d rather not abuse the grammatical glitch excuse, and in canon I&#39;ve so far seen two Daleks get humanized, but one committed suicide while the other had to... eat someone first. Or something. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately most of &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (Second Doctor) was lost when the BBC did an archive purge.  But the novelization and Tardis Wiki entry both speak of a conversion arch rigged by the Doctor to implant the Human Factor in Daleks.  Maybe a bit-Dalek got shoved through a conversion arch by accident during a mission?  Or one of the humanized Daleks from that episode &quot;got lost&quot; when the episode tapes were junked and wound up in HQ?<br><br>(Link: <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_of_the_Daleks"><a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_of_the_Daleks">http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_of_the_Daleks</a></a>)</p>

            <p>Loved that episode. <br><br>Don&#39;t worry: I also find that Daleks have some sort of odd charm. There&#39;s something inherently funny about the way they scream &quot;EXTERMINATE&quot; in a semi-hysterical fashion. Or is it just me? Anyone?<br><br> The PPC can administer the Human Factor to a Dalek in order to create a <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Humanised_Dalek">Humanized Dalek</a>  which takes away the instinct to hate and destroy and replaces it with a more... well, <i>human</i> personality. <br><br>Agent Omicron is a humanized Dalek. There are no missions featuring him (I think), but he is a precedent. I, for one, would absolutely love seeing a Humanized Dalek scoot around PPC HQ and the reactions of Whovian agents...</p>

Your task now is to make better ones by selecting your favorite holiday song and giving it some new, PPC-themed words.

(There is <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/2011/spinspinspin.html">one</a>, though, &#39;cause that was my entry last year.)

            <p>The first one is to the tune of &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;, right? It looks like it should fit the tune pretty well.<br><br>Anyway, these are both really well done - I especially like &quot;One Small Agent&quot; - and not just because I&#39;m an Enya nut. Good job!</p>

            <p>Yes, I realized nobody had done one for &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;, so I did one.

            <p>I&#39;ve been really looking forward to this!<br><br>My song is based on John Rutters Candlelight Carol, a very beautiful song, which have done nothing to deserve to be mangled by me. None the less, I thought it would make a nice song about loving the canon and wanting to protect it from badfics. And since The Hobbit has just come out, I used that to put a spin on. But less babbling, more singing:<br><br><br>How do you capture the vision of Tolkien?<br><br>How do you count all the treasures of Smaug?<br><br>How can you measure our love of the canon?<br><br>And how do you write all the Dwarrows so proud?<br><br><br><br>Candlelight, Elven-light<br><br>Dragonfire and star glow<br><br>Shining on Arda till breaking of dawn<br><br>Badfic, oh!

            <p>I&#39;d never heard the Candlelight Carol before. Very pretty! And the new words fit perfectly, too—except maybe for &quot;giant-a** spiders,&quot; just because it&#39;s a bit of a departure from the otherwise meditative and serious tone, but a laugh at the end is good. Can&#39;t really expect agents to be serious for too long, can we? ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m trying to filk &quot;What Is Christmas?&quot; from their album <i>The Lost Christmas Eve</i>. It&#39;s such a cool, almost villain song, especially with that guy&#39;s voice and the evil laugh he does at one point. I&#39;m thinking &quot;What Is Concrit?&quot; from the point of view of an obstinate fanbrat. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A filk about goodfic, unique! Also, Trans-Siberian Orchestra--I have a friend who likes it and she played some of the music for me on her iPod. I think it&#39;s good. Also, this is the same friend who got me into fanfiction and recommended <i>Sherlock</i> and <i>Good Omens</i>. So I&#39;m inclined to trust her judgement.</p>

            <p>Sorry, didn&#39;t see the first list, but wow that&#39;s a lot of fandoms. I probably have just as many, but whenever I try to list them I end up forgetting a few. I&#39;m also constantly gaining fandoms, so the list is never complete.<br><br>If my (admittedly awful) translation skills are correct, then Betty la Fea would translate to Ugly Betty, which is/was a show up here in America. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re the same, or if I even translated that correctly, but they could possibly be similar-ish? Maybe?<br><br>I have not heard of Kingdoms of Middle-Earth, though I am of the Hobbit and the LotR. I&#39;m not very big into online games though. *Is a boring stuffy young codger*<br><br>Anyway, because I&#39;m noticing a large amount of animated fandoms, I give you this cartoonifier! It will transform anything you wish into a bubbly, two-dimensional work of art. Just be sure not to point it at things that are already cartoons; they might implode.</p>

I ranted x<em>x<br>But look it up in YouTube , I am not a big fan of soap operas(Most of them suck so much .</em>.), but  this one is different, and I bet they got it with English subtitles and all :D<br><br>This game is cool enough, when the other players are not stealing your resources or massacring your army, that is.<br>I find the global chat amusing, hardly anyone there posses sanity, so you can guess how it must be.<br><br>Oh a cartoonifier! I shall have tons of fun with this! Thank you for the gift :D<br></p>

I am trained in gorilla apple and I&#39;m the top apple in the entire US armed apples. You are nothing to me but just another apple. I will wipe you the apple out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this apple, mark my appleing apples. You think you can get away with saying that apple to me over the apple? Think again, apple. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of apple across the USA and your apple is being appled right now so you better prepare for the storm, apple. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your apple. You&#39;re appleing dead, apple. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can apple you in over seven hundred apples, and that&#39;s just with my apple hands. Not only am I extensively trained in apple combat, but I have access to the entire apple of the United States Apple Corps and I will use it to its full apple to wipe your miserable apple off the face of the apple, you little apple. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little &quot;clever&quot; apple was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your ...ing apple. But you couldn&#39;t, you didn&#39;t, and now you&#39;re paying the price, you goddamn apple. I will apple all over you and you will drown in it. You&#39;re appleing dead, apple. </p>

            <p>Good to see you, second newbie of the day. You have just helped to demonstrate what I like to call the &quot;Newbie Pack Phenomenon&quot;. For some reason, newbies tend to come in twos and threes, even if they&#39;ve never met or heard of the other newbie before. It&#39;s a rather curious trend, but it&#39;s been around for a while.<br><br>But, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to give you any less of a welcome! Although, you might want to hide those sunflower seeds; the Sunflower Official probably wouldn&#39;t take to kindly to them.<br><br>For your newbie gift, I present to you this bottle of Bleepnog, in order for you to help us celebrate the holiday season and our filk-fest down below. It&#39;s probably made of eggnog and Bleeprin, but I&#39;m not quite sure, seeing as I just invented it. Have fun!</p>

            <p>I saw the movie at the midnight opening and the movie was great.  I do have my nitpicks, of course (the long review is in my LJ) but I would rank it 9/10 as a movie and 5.5/10 as a Tolkien adaptation owing to a couple significant (at least, for me) changes.<br><br>Given that they do have Hot!Dwarves (I must say Movie!Thorin is very much worth of fangirling... and Richard Armitage would make a fine son of Feanor...), I figured that as soon as more people see the movie, the Hobbit section of FF.net will explode.

            <p>Jut been to see the film myself, and I have to say, I loved it. Massive changes from the book, which I expected, but I find myself rather pleased with the way they expanded on it, for the most part.<br><br>The alterations I didn&#39;t like, mostly specific points:<br><br>-Thror&#39;s unexplained gold greed. I mean, my mind filled in the blank (Ring of Power) but my mum and sister, who have never looked at a Tolkien book in their lives, had no idea where it came from.<br><br>-Thranduil on a moose/elk/whatever? (My sister thought it was a reindeer.) For that matter, Thranduil coming all the way from Mirkwood just to watch the dwarves escape and then ride off again as soon as they shouted for help. I&#39;m pretty sure he wouldn&#39;t have risked being spotted by Smaug just to go <i>look</i>. It also made for a rather annoying excuse for angst and needless hostility towards Elves on Thorin&#39;s part, and possibly an excuse to cram in the &quot;typical&quot; Elf/Dwarf dislikes.<br><br>-The dwarves&#39; manners. They were described in the book as calling for plenty of food, but the sense I always got was that they are supposed to be nobility of a sort, and they had manners enough to know how to eat without half the meal dribbling out of their mouths. I blame the portrayal of movie!Gimli for that - belching and spilling his ale. Very disappointed.<br><br>-Azog becoming the main antagonist. He is supposed to be DEAD.<br><br>-The Great Goblin was possibly the least pleasant image I could have imagined. Someone clearly decided to play around with alternate meanings of &quot;great&quot;.<br><br>-No mention was given to how Bilbo worked out that the Ring was making him invisible.<br><br><br>But for the most part I find I very much enjoyed the way it was adapted. I was thrilled to see the backstory explaining why the quest was even taking place, especially Thorin earning his name of Oakenshield, and I liked the way the history led into the main story, particularly the exchange between older!Bilbo and Frodo that had so many callbacks to the opening of FotR.<br><br>The dwarves, for the most part, were far more rugged and shorter-bearded than I imagined when I read the book all those years ago - two-thirds of my lifetime ago, ye gods I feel old. XD However, I think I like these versions better, all except Bombur. I&#39;m kinda disappointed that they made him look like such a joke compared to the others. I also like the way they don&#39;t have just a band of axe-wielders. They have excellent archers and slingers, hammer-wielders, and fine swordsmen. I&#39;ve grown extremely fond of Fili and Kili - they definitely play their role as the youngest and liveliest of the group, even if their relationship to Thorin hasn&#39;t yet been made clear in the film. I rather hope it will be, it was one of the things I liked about those two - he&#39;s not just their leader and rightful king, he&#39;s their uncle.<br><br>Radagast... well, I was kind of thrown at first by the way he was portrayed, and I know there&#39;s been a big debate between others about him further down the thread, but I rather sort of came to like his portrayal. He&#39;s rather dotty, forgetful, and quite frankly a mess that people can and will poke fun at, but he has a wonderful kind of power when it comes to what he knows and loves. He&#39;s also extremely courageous. First, he walked into Dol Guldur  - a known refuge of dark powers - and fought hand to hand with what is implied to be the Witch-King of Angmar or one of his servants, and RADAGAST was the one who won. Secondly, he came to warn Gandalf and then deliberately drew the pack of Warg-riding orcs off the dwarves, putting himself in danger to help his friend and cousin.<br><br>Rivendell was just as gorgeous as I remembered it, and I loved seeing more bits of it. I also have to opine that Elrond looks rather good on a horse. :P In fact, I like Elrond much more in this film than when he was being the overprotective dad in LotR. His role as Exposition Man in this film was well written, I think, with the moon-runes and his identification of the swords. <br><br>On that note, the meeting of the White Council was enjoyable; I was having to muffle the urge to cackle watching Saruman&#39;s attempts to downplay the seriousness of everything. Galadriel was nicely mystical as usual - standing in the background but prodding Gandalf on so he wouldn&#39;t just back down in front of Saruman. I look forwards to seeing how things pan out in the next films.<br><br>(Heading off on a random tangent here - it was rather nice to see how Elrond deferred a bit to everyone else, being as he is the most junior of the Council by several thousand years. Gandalf placed the Morgul-blade on the table, Elrond went to pick it up without even knowing what it was (&quot;ooh, shiny&quot;), and barely got warned off in time - I spotted him snatching his hand back. Random little moment, but it made me chuckle.)<br><br>With regards to the thunderstorm - I heard &quot;Storm Giants&quot;, not &quot;Stone Giants&quot;, whoever it was that heard it the other way.<br><br>The cave scene was quite touching - Bilbo had enough doubts to consider really going home without Thorin getting cranky about it, but his own acceptance of the fact that he&#39;s not cut out for adventure makes his eventual decision to stick with it all the better.<br><br>The dwarves&#39; escape from the goblin halls fed my love of extended, inventive hand-to-hand combat scenes perfectly. Not much to say other than that I was inwardly cheering them on the whole way. :D<br><br>The Riddles In The Dark scene. OH MY VALAR. It was everything I could have hoped for with the exception of one or two omitted riddles. I very nearly squeed on seeing Gollum just as I remembered him from LotR, and the use of his split personality was brilliant. The final, dawning realisation of &quot;...what has it got in its nasty little pocketses?&quot; sent chills down my spine.<br><br>Bilbo&#39;s own escape from the tunnels was amazing. His struggle with his decision over whether or not to try to kill Gollum had me wibbling just a teensy bit, especially the moment where he chose not to and just leapt for freedom. His return to the group was less triumphant than I&#39;d hoped, but his answer to Thorin&#39;s &quot;Why did you come back?&quot; made me melt. Because the dwarves haven&#39;t got a home any more, and he&#39;s going to help them get it back - it&#39;s such a hobbity, kind answer, it really shows the essential Bilbo-ishness.<br><br>The scene around the trees had me on the edge of my seat. Thorin&#39;s battle with Azog was rather nerve-wracking, and the most bewildering bit - his friends and relatives are struggling for their lives, but he forgets all about them just so he can go fight his mortal enemy. On the other hand, Bilbo&#39;s Tookishness in running to help, even if he didn&#39;t have a clue what he was doing, made me have to muffle the cheering. I&#39;m a sucker for heroics.<br><br>On a similar note, I very nearly gnawed my nails off waiting for the eagles to arrive. Every time the tension wne t up a notch, I was thinking &quot;surely it&#39;s time for them to show up? ...well, it&#39;s gotta be now, surely... any moment now... What the - THORIN IS AMOST DEAD WHERE ARE THE EAGLES PETER JACKSON GIVE ME THE DAMN EAGLES DWARVES ARE FALLING OFF THE CLIFF oh thank the Valar there they are&quot;.<br><br>And finally, the point where Thorin pretty much apologises to Bilbo left me practically skipping out of the cinema at midnight, and coming online as soon as I got home to spill all my excited thoughts at you guys so I can calm down enough to sleep.<br><br>So, here they are. I hope this isn&#39;t too much, but I wanted to share my opinions. It is, after all, a continuation of where the PPC first came from, and now, more than ten years later, the story  - and the adventure - lives on.</p>

            <p>I quite liked it, myself.<br><br>First off, as a film: I described it at the time as a mix between The Hobbit and LotR - not quite epic fantasy, but a lot more than the children&#39;s book. A fair number of people here have said they disliked that - I disagree. I think it worked well - the light and the serious in the same story.<br><br>Particularly given the framing device - that this is Bilbo&#39;s version written specifically for Frodo (as opposed to &#39;My Diary - My Unexpected Journey - There And Back Again - And What Happened After&#39; - that telling of a lightened-up-epic-adventure is pretty much what you&#39;d expect. Frodo is turning 33 on the day Bilbo thinks of writing it - or in Mannish terms, 18 or so. A fairly lighthearted story with some blood-pumping action scenes is about what you&#39;d give him to read at that age.<br><br>But I also thought it worked for the audience (of which there were... um, not much more than a dozen, for some reason). The pocket handkerchief probably caught my attention first on this front - we have Bilbo&#39;s childish demand to turn back because he&#39;s forgotten his (similar to the book), but instead of someone having a spare, Fili (I think) throws him - a bit of his coat he rips off. Which is realism but also funny.<br><br>I also liked the way they used the songs - while carefully cutting out things like &#39;Tra-la-la-lally&#39;. It is a shame about Fifteen Birds In Five Fir Trees, though.<br><br>On the filmic aspects I didn&#39;t like: the Goblin King was not very nice to look at, and didn&#39;t <i>really</i> seem to fit with his people. He seemed like he was about to pull out a novel or something. I can see why they did it - in fact, I agree that it&#39;s a good way to go with the character - but... not and make him look like that. The Hobbit is not a film you make to play games with your audience.<br><br>... kind of the only thing, really.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Okay, the adaptation. First off, the main plot:<br><br>Yeah, they mangled it around a bit. Thorin arrives late to the Party, they&#39;re not even heading for Rivendell, Bilbo loses them earlier, the whole Five Fir Trees scene was scrambled. But... really, they&#39;re not <i>significant</i> changes. Most of them - even the minor ones, like the way the troll scene ended - are within the realm of &#39;Well, I remember that differently, Bilbo!&#39;. That troll scene - they used Bilbo, not Gandalf, to play for time, and then Gandalf broke a rock. Well, you know, the whole thing where the sun SUDDENLY was up and turning people to stone never made sense to me. Sunrises don&#39;t <i>do</i> that. Whereas stalling until sunrise and then <i>making</i> a way for it to get in is pretty darn clever.<br><br>(And yeah, they cut out the giant talking eagles and the &#39;let&#39;s have cooked breakfast in the Eyrie&#39; scene. Can you blame them?)<br><br>As for the specific characters: I admit I can only identify about half the dwarves (Thorin, Fili, Kili, Gloin because I was looking for him, Balin, probably Dori, Bombur of course, and... one I gather is Bofur? Although I didn&#39;t get his name at the time. The Cossack). On the other hand, in the <i>book</i> I can only do Thorin, Fili-and-Kili, Bombur, and Balin. So that&#39;s kind of a plus.<br><br>I liked Thorin. My main problem was the amount of time he seemed to spend lying on his back with half-lidded eyes, glowering at people. But I liked the Lost Prince vibe.<br><br>Gandalf... um. Ian McKellan&#39;s a fan, isn&#39;t he? I actually think he overacted a lot of the lines from the book  (I am Gandalf, and Gandalf... hmmm... hmmm... means ME), which is exactly the sort of thing a long-term fan would do with lines they know (think of people declaiming &#39;To be or not to be&#39; - that sort of thing). But when he <i>wasn&#39;t</i> overacting, I liked him.<br><br>And I adored Bilbo. To the people who say he was barely in it - well, he was barely in that part of the book, either. He pretty much tags along and gets picked up by dwarves. The only things he <i>does</i> after leaving Hobbiton are a) bungle the troll scene, b) alert Gandalf to the goblins, and c) the Gollum scene. So this version was a <i>lot</i> more pro-active. And very well acted, in my opinion.<br><br>Specific scenes: Riddles in the Dark was very good. I felt for Gollum, I really did, and again - it was more serious than the book, but less than LotR. The problem of how to make a hungry monster volunteer for a game of riddles was well handled - and made <i>use</i> of Smeagollum, rather than just putting him in for fun.<br><br>Five Fir Trees was very much scrambled, but... again, it worked. (I assume none of the dwarves were in a position to go and help - we saw that with a couple, but it could have done with highlighting for the others).<br><br>(And I like the Stone - not Storm, Hellga, I think you misheard - Giants. They were fun. ;))<br><br>Um, essentially, and unlike &#39;Faramir is evil! Sam turns back! Elves go to the Hornburg! Flaming Denethor!&#39;, none of the changes broke <i>character</i>. <i>If</i> Thorin had been faced with an archenemy, he totally would have gone murder-happy. The only character changed was Bilbo - but we watched him gain more confidence during the film than he did in the book, so it didn&#39;t bother me.<br><br>So: as an adaptation of the book plot, it throws it around a bit, but not badly enough to bother me. But there&#39;s another aspect: the history.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Oh <i>stars</i> they messed that up. A quick count:<br><br>-Thror&#39;s gold-fever: actually pretty canonical, but I saw someone mention it. <i>He wore a Dwarven Ring of Power</i>, guys. The Seven are canonically attested to not sway Dwarves to Sauron, but rather to turn them inwards and fill them with gold-lust. So yeah, he probably would have been. And, Neshomeh, I didn&#39;t get the &#39;Smaug showed up because&#39; vibe - I guess that&#39;s an interpretation, though.<br><br>-Azog, Thror, Khazad-Dum and Nanduhirion: Oh dear. That was a <i>royal</i> mess. From &#39;Thror enters Moria alone and is killed by Azog, so Thrain, Nain, Thorin and Dain wage war and kill him (but are scared off from entering Moria by Durin&#39;s Bane) we get &#39;Thror is killed in battle by Azog, Thorin fails to kill him, he goes wandering across Eregion hunting dwarves&#39;. Yeah, pretty sure the Rangers would have something to say about that. &#39;The Wargs have come west of the mountains&#39; is a significant thing in LotR - not so the movie version, since they were happily wandering over there all the time.<br><br>I don&#39;t think they <i>needed</i> a running villain - but it&#39;s the same decision-making process as brought down <i>Dawn Treader</i>, when they decided they needed to turn the book into a quest for seven magic swords.  And no, Orcs - even Orcs from Gundabad - shouldn&#39;t be running around in the daytime (though did anyone notice how fast night fell after Bilbo returned near the end?). So I disagree with this change - I think it was pretty pointless and stupid - but fortunately, it wasn&#39;t that <i>big</i> a change. It lead to angsty!Thorin, some pointless Wargs (and Rivendell Lancers, which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFME2">from a computer game</a>), but not much else. So there&#39;s that, at least.<br><br>-Radagast: I have gone on <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=234646;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">at length</a> as to why I like this Radagast. I won&#39;t even try to rehash it here.<br><br>-The White Council: Again, I have no problem with them meeting while Mithrandir was in Rivendell anyway. They met several times as it is. I think Saruman was well-written (and very scathing - but as mentioned in the Radagast post, he <i>never</i> got on with the Bird-Tamer), and I liked the Galadriel-Gandalf interaction. I&#39;m assuming Apparating!Galadriel was for dramatic effect, not an indication that she can either teleport or trap Gandalf in an illusion. Not sure what they were forshadowing with that &#39;If you ever need me&#39; line, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find out.<br><br>-The Witch-King: Oh... dear. Assuming that was him in Dol Guldur, I <i>guess</i> Radagast would be able to see him - like Glorfindel, he was in Valinor at the time of the Trees, so he should live in &#39;both the seen and unseen worlds&#39; (even if being a demigod doesn&#39;t automatically give him that power). But. Er.<br><br>&#39;After the fall of Angmar the men of wherever took the Witch-King&#39;s body and buried it deep underground, blah darkness, blah never find, BUT LOOK SWORD&#39;.<br><br>... which part of <i>No living man may hinder me</i> did they miss? It&#39;s not like Tolkien was subtle about this, you know - Merry&#39;s attack specifically &#39;pierc[es] the sinew behind his mighty knee&#39;, not some ethereal wossname. The Morgul Lord isn&#39;t a <i>ghost</i> - he&#39;s essentially a terrifying invisible zombie. The one thing he isn&#39;t is <i>dead</i>.<br><br>The <i>only</i> way I can reconcile that is by assuming the unheard name of who buried him (yes, I missed it) was his own allies, and that&#39;s just what they said when captured. But I don&#39;t think so, somehow.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So, final tally: I liked it as a film, wasn&#39;t too bothered about the plot changes, and was squirming through several pieces of the introduced extra plot. But overall, I enjoyed it, will see the other two, and will hope they mess things up less, not more, next time.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I loved this movie!  I haven&#39;t read <i>the Hobbit</i> since freshman year of high school, so I&#39;m sorry to all the hardcore Tolkien fans who didn&#39;t enjoy it as much.  But I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br><br>I didn&#39;t find the serious and humor bits to be that disjointed.  It&#39;s the result of blending the original <i>Hobbit</i> style with Middle-earth&#39;s main storyline, and I think it works.  It shows that, even with all the strife happening throughout the ages, there were still simpler moments being enjoyed by the average denizens of Middle-earth.  (Not that Thorin&#39;s company are exactly ordinary, BUT)<br><br>I LOVE RADIGAST.  Based on other comments, it sounds like he was pretty different in the books, but holy crap, I love him.  He&#39;s probably my favorite Tolkien canon now, and I don&#39;t think I even had one before I watched this movie.  Being someone who likes animals more than people myself . . . I didn&#39;t find him that strange.  &lt;. and as odd he acted still showed off some impressive talent what with evading the wargs fighting witch-king holy crap that entire scene was just utterly terrifying so i think portrayed a plenty competent wizard.&gt;<br>The scene between Bilbo and Gollum was awesome.  I do dislike when they replace an entire character with CGI, but in Gollum&#39;s case, I don&#39;t mind it, since a living actor could never portray his wasted-away form properly.<br><br>The thing I am most sad about is that they cut out ♪these silly little birds, they have no wings; oh what shall we do with the silly little things?♪  I get that orcs haven&#39;t really been established as a race that sings at all, but that was still an awesome, awesome song.  ;_;<br><br>I wasn&#39;t bothered by the rehashed music; I had expected it, actually, and it feels like a natural choice, since it takes place in the same world/story.</p>

            <p>Down below, you compare Radagast to a &quot;drug-addled, hippie stereotype.&quot;  The reason I like him is that, despite having those characteristics at face value, he still manages to be a very powerful force for good in this movie.  He rescues his hedgehog friend while simultaneously driving away the great spiders*.  He tracks down the source of dark magic and attempts to investigate all on his own, then manages to fend off (probably) the Witch-King of Angmar, then only flees in the face of Sauron, which pretty much no one could have fought one-on-one.  He risks his own life, and the lives of his rabbits, to try to rescue Gandalf&#39;s party so they could continue their journey.<br><br>So despite Radagast&#39;s hippie-ish, possibly drugged, I-love-animals-so-much-I-give-them-people-names <i>exterior</i>, he is still presented to the audience as a very capable character who is clearly on the side of good.  The humor aspects of his character provide a fun contrast to his powers, and that is a large part of why Radagast has become my favorite Tolkien character in the last week.<br><br>*This scene really made no sense to me, and is probably the main biggest complaint I have with the Radagast subplot.  I don&#39;t understand why removing the sickness from Bartholomew would make the great spiders leave.  It seems like the dark energy is still there, inside Radagast&#39;s house; why would the spiders care if it&#39;s in a hedgehog or in a bottle?  Perhaps someone with greater Tolkien knowledge than me can explain something I don&#39;t know about the spiders?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t actually know what people have against movie!Radagast. I&#39;ll go into this in more (er, probably less) detail in my full review, but...<br><br><a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/w/whitecouncil.html">The Encyclopedia of Arda</a> indicates him as a <i>presumed</i> member of the White Council, but he&#39;s never stated to be one. Of Tolkien&#39;s <i>specific</i> statements, we know that Aiwendil was a follower of Yavanna (noted for getting very, uh, snippy with her craftsman, people-centred husband) whose company was forced on Saruman - so yeah, I can&#39;t see them getting on too well.<br><br>We also know that (quoting Unfinished Tales) &#39;Of all the Istari, only one [Gandalf] remained faithful. For Radagast, the fourth, became enamoured of the many beasts and birds that dwelt in Middle-earth, and forsook Elves and Men, and spent his days among the wild creatures&#39;. Radagast as we first see him <i>exactly</i> fits that description - down to the specific word &#39;enamoured&#39;. The main problem with him is that he bothered to seek out Gandalf at all. :P<br><br>And... y&#39;know what, I think it was good to see a different form of divine magic at work. Mithrandir mostly uses fire (hence Narya, confrontations with Balrogs, and potentially even special concern about dragons) and mind magic (we saw some healing/soothing on Thorin at the end - and remember that he&#39;s a Maia of Manwe and Nienna), while Saruman (as a follower of Aule) tends to resort to naked force or, again, mind magic (but influencing rather than soothing - they both have quite a voice on them).<br><br>With Radagast, we saw a different archetype: object centred (that crystal), <i>difficult</i> healing (given how much he had to focus on the words).... and mind magic <i>again</i>, but this time the kind that befriends - part soothing, part control, but mostly neither. He just uses it on animals, not people.<br><br>And as with the other two, it both comes from and feeds into his personality. Saruman is a controller even without his voice - he&#39;s constitutionally incapable of <i>not</i> being in charge. Gandalf has a wicked sense of humour, but a kind one, because his powers are centred around:<br><br><i>A deadly sword, a healing hand,<br>a back that bent beneath its load;<br>a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,<br>a weary pilgrim on the road.</i><br>(Thanks to F. Baggins, esq.)<br><br>And Radagast? He&#39;s skittish like the animals he associates with, not very good at distrust (he trusts Saruman to the last, and by the film, pretty much walks straight into an enemy stronghold) since he&#39;s friendship-based (&#39;Aiwendil&#39; means &#39;Friend of birds&#39;, just as &#39;Olorin&#39; is &#39;The Dreaming Visionary&#39; and &#39;Curumo&#39; is &#39;The Crafty One&#39; - again, all leading back to their particular mental magic), and when he does exert overt power, it&#39;s thoroughly nature-based (the crystal again, whatever he was collecting things for, and those rabbits).<br><br>Yes, it&#39;s <i>jarring</i> seeing a cousin of Mithrandir and Curunir act like that - but maybe it should be. He&#39;s essentially a nature spirit by this time - even more so than the ever-absent Bombadil, who was Master without being particularly concerned with his domain - and nature spirits are... well, in touch with nature.<br><br>The one thing I would <i>not</i> have expected would be a calm, collected, noble-looking man in a brown robe who sits down at councils and debates things in archaic style. Radagast <i>fell</i>, remember - and he did so by getting too close to his favourite subject, nature.<br><br>As a final comparison - Saruman pretty much accused Gandalf of getting &#39;too close&#39;, to Hobbits in particular. And what do we know about Gandalf? He has a sense of humour - unlike his cousins, but a lot like Hobbits - he likes fireworks and safe spectacle - again, very Hobbitish (and can you imagine Saruman putting on a firework show?) - he enjoys being <i>around</i> Hobbits, and, oh yes, he smokes pipe-weed, which is a <i>very</i> hobbitish trait.<br><br>So Gandalf gets close to and ends up very <i>like</i> his charges. If Radagast did the same thing - and we know he did - then he ought to end up like <i>his</i> charges - the birds and beasts.<br><br>Do you think he <i>wasn&#39;t</i>?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Like I said, he made me uncomfortable. Nothing objective about it; I just felt viscerally uneasy any time he was onscreen. Like watching someone poke sticks at the slow kid, or when someone who hasn&#39;t bathed in a week and reeks of booze comes up to you looking for change. The way they played him was just yucky to me. A yucky, one-note, drug-addled-hippie stereotype.<br><br>For something objectively off, this is something I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t cover in the history part of your review: when do you think Radagast&#39;s scenes at Rhosgobel and Dol Guldur were meant to have taken place in the movie? The way they cut back and forth between them and the main storyline, I&#39;d think those events were happening at the same time—but then, how long did it take him to get from Dol Guldur to Gandalf and the Dwarves? And if the Necromancer was barely stirring and Dol Guldur mostly unoccupied as the quest was on its way, where exactly did Gandalf find Thrain imprisoned, and by whom?<br><br>Or, suppose we were seeing Radagast however many (hundreds of?) years ago, as per canon. What prompted him to leave just in time to catch up with Gandalf on the road? Why now, and not earlier or later? And, like you said, why <i>ever</i>, with him being him?<br><br>I&#39;d also like to know how he crossed the Anduin and the Misty Mountains with his rabbit-sledge in any event, but that&#39;s minor. He IS a wizard, I&#39;m sure he figured something out. I&#39;m just curious.<br><br>I don&#39;t think he really behaves like any wild animal or bird I&#39;ve ever seen. If that were so, I would expect him to be more cautious and quiet, quick to react when startled (to either flee, freeze, or fight), but otherwise very much taking his time to assess things before/while acting—looking, listening, probably smelling and tasting, too. Animals tend to conserve their energy. I&#39;d expect him to move with greater restraint and efficiency, and to talk a whole helluva lot less. Radagast <i>withdrew</i> from the problems of the world to tend to his creatures, so I&#39;d expect him to be withdrawn, a bit vague, not really on the same page as other people, but still capable of getting a coherent thought across once he remembers he needs to use words.<br><br>And he doesn&#39;t need to be constantly covered in bird poop. Animals DO groom themselves, and they don&#39;t trap each other underneath hats, where it&#39;s tight and dark and they can&#39;t escape. Actual animal-lovers don&#39;t do that, either.<br><br>~Neshomeh, starting to feel like she, Phobos, and VM saw a different movie than everyone else.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right that his character was quite stereotyped - but then, he was in the film for, what, ten minutes? Fifteen at the outside? Getting &#39;absentminded&#39; across by showing a lack of grooming is less time-consuming than by, well, writing a script that includes it. Not that that&#39;s a <i>good</i> thing, but that&#39;s film for you, I&#39;m afraid.<br><br>(On which note - our screening had a trailer for &#39;The Impossible&#39;, in which the tragedy of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is shown through the only kind of characters cinemagoers can relate to - white ones. <i>That&#39;s</i> appalling)<br><br>I didn&#39;t cover it because I didn&#39;t write the whole review at once, and it slipped in between &#39;I should put this in&#39; and &#39;meh, already did Radagast&#39;. :P I don&#39;t think they&#39;re actually <i>concurrent</i> events - that&#39;s just a cinematic device (&quot;Meanwhile, in the past...&quot;) - but I think we&#39;re supposed to read it as him fleeing directly from Dol Guldur to Gandalf. Yes, that would take a while, so it can&#39;t have been <i>actually</i> simultaneous, but it also wasn&#39;t 400 years.<br><br>I wondered about Thrain at the time, and to be honest I haven&#39;t a clue. From the dialogue we&#39;ve had (&#39;Your father gave it to me&#39; and &#39;Thrain went mad&#39;), it sounds like Thrain&#39;s disappearance is just going to be the battle. He must have given it to Gandalf earlier (didn&#39;t he say it was &#39;for safekeeping&#39;? Not what you&#39;d say if you were in Sauron&#39;s clutches). I don&#39;t think the exchange happened in Dol Guldur this time through - though I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Gandalf met Thrain <i>during the film</i> in the dungeons.<br><br>Do I agree with that? No. I don&#39;t know why they did it, and it jars. Probably solely so they could have Radagast discover the corruption of the Greenwood in real-time, but that&#39;s, er, stupid.<br><br>How did he cross the mountains? Well, we <i>know</i> he&#39;s friends with the Eagles... and we know they <i>can</i> refrain from eating things they think are rabbits (eg, Bilbo).<br><br>As to behaving like a wild animal... well, I&#39;m a chemist, not an animalologist, so I&#39;ll take your word for that. I think it&#39;s important to remember that he&#39;s still a <i>man</i> (lowercase), though - he may have picked up a few animal traits, but he&#39;s still fundamentally thinking like a person. Possibly a drugged one, but actually I just figured Saruman made that up. Literally the only scene which could confirm it is the bizarre stick-insect moment, which, er, what. I&#39;d have to say he was just very nervous about being around people - particularly his cousin Gandalf.<br><br>Hey, if Saruman talks the same way about pipe-weed and mushrooms, does that mean <i>he&#39;s</i> on the mushrooms, too?<br><br>As to the bird nest... eh. I&#39;d call it a protective measure, since the woods are turning dark, and probably one he&#39;s not used to yet (hence the droppings). I noticed that the colour of the tangle changed significantly between Mirkwood and the Trollshaws - it was all pretty fresh in the first scene.<br><br>I&#39;d also point out that no, birds wouldn&#39;t do that normally - but they&#39;re under the magical influence of a demigod. And if I&#39;m right that his mental forte is trust and friendship, then yes, he could probably persuade them to do almost anything for &#39;their own good&#39;. Saruman nearly persuaded several of the Fellowship that he was on their side, after all...<br><br>Which means, actually, that Radagast could be a <i>terrifying</i> villain, done right. Someone who can make you trust him to the extent of violating every instinct you have to do what he says? I&#39;m scared already, frankly.<br><br>You&#39;re certainly right that you <i>could</i> present Radagast differently - you could play him as Mowgli, Tarzan, Bombadil, Beorn, or any other nature-type character. Yes, he <i>could</i> be very collected, cautious, unwilling to speak, but coherent when he needs to be - but that&#39;s far from the only possibility. And, honestly? Given that we have exactly three (maybe four) Hobbit-LotR characters anywhere near equivalent to his level of power (Gandalf, Saruman, Bombadil maybe, and Gwaihir) - and not many more in Silm (Huan, maybe? Melian? None of the Ainur do a lot of talking over there) - there&#39;s very little to say how he <i>should</i> be.<br><br>All That Aside... I think he <i>was</i> played up for comic effect (yeah, I know, duh). Again, this is Bilbo telling a story to Frodo on the cusp of adulthood - or, if you prefer, it&#39;s an adaptation of a children&#39;s book. A lot of things are comedified. This is hardly on the dwarf-tossing level of blasphemy.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: No, I think it was the same film. :P <i>Hellga</i> seems to have seen a different version to me, since we remember different songs, but that&#39;s about it. People are allowed to have differing opinions, you know... :P</p>

            <p>Because once I get the DVD and watch it a couple more times, I will start picking out all the things I dislike. <br><br>Besides, after LotR, I don&#39;t have terribly high expectations of PJ.  I don&#39;t think I have managed to force myself rewatch The Two Towers twice in the last 10 years - mainly because it was such a disappointment the first time I saw it, with expectations rather high post-FotR.

Different storytelling, yes; visuals over exposition, yes—but not a quick visual over scriptwriting, direction, and acting. If this is a case of visual instead of writing, stereotype over substance, then it&#39;s pure laziness, which is bad in any medium. If they didn&#39;t want to spend time on the character, they could have just left him out instead. Since they put him in, I expect professional time and effort spent on him.<br><br>I think at least ten of his fifteen-ish minutes were spent on that hedgehog, anyway. What was its name? Bartholomew or something like that? O.o<br><br>Anyway. What&#39;s really confusing me here, and the source of my feeling that maybe I&#39;m on another planet or something, is that lots of people seem to be saying this movie was awesome, they really loved it, it&#39;s better than (at least some of) the LotR movies, etc., in spite of its flaws. I mean, just to continue with this one point as an example, you agree that Radagast&#39;s character is a stereotype, that it&#39;s bad for quick visuals to trump writing, that it&#39;s dumb to have him witness the corruption of the Greenwood in real time, that the stick-insect moment was bizarre, and that he was overall jarring, but you still liked him, or at least didn&#39;t mind him. Was there really something so good about him that it overcomes the flaws? If so, what is it and where can I see it? Or, is it that you don&#39;t mind because it&#39;s film, which takes me back to my first paragraph?<br><br>Differences of opinion are fine, but I like to understand why they exist, is all. For instance, I understand completely why people (Phobos, for instance) don&#39;t mind the Elves at Helm&#39;s Deep even though it makes me tear my hair: it doesn&#39;t do anything to negatively impact the story, so if you don&#39;t have any particular attachment to book!canon, there&#39;s nothing objectively wrong with it. It doesn&#39;t do anything to positively impact the story, either, but you wouldn&#39;t necessarily know that unless someone who read the books told you. The point is, from a purely movie-based standpoint, it doesn&#39;t hurt anything.<br><br>I think Radagast really does, though. Again, he&#39;s just a single point, but maybe if I can understand this one point of difference, it&#39;ll help me understand the rest.<br><br>~Neshomeh, lost and trying to get un-lost.</p>

            <p>The problem I have with elves at the Hornburg is that they&#39;re the <i>wrong</i> elves in the <i>wrong</i> place. Even allowing for the fact that Galadriel could have said &#39;Hey, that alliance my nephew/remote cousin made, I guess that&#39;s sort of binding on me, so I&#39;ll send some of my non-high-elf chums along to help out&#39;... the Last Alliance (which Haldir, if you recall, specifically says they&#39;ve come to renew) was <i>not with the Northmen</i>. Elves at the Pelennor would have made sense. Elves at Dagorlad would have made sense. Elves in Rohan makes <i>no sense at all</i>.<br><br>Whereas scatterbrained Radagast <i>does</i> make sense; it doesn&#39;t run wildly counter to what we know of canon (unlike, I confess, ghost!Witch-King and abandoned!Dol Guldur).<br><br>Okay. Since you&#39;re trying to understand, and I&#39;m clearly explaining badly, I&#39;ll go for point-by-point in the hopes that a scattergun approach will hit something we agree on. :P<br><br><i>Trouble is, I don&#39;t accept &quot;it&#39;s film&quot; as an excuse for bad storytelling.[...]</i><br><br>I don&#39;t think he suffered from bad storytelling, per se. I think (and will no doubt expound on at length) that they decided his character didn&#39;t need lengthy explanations when they&#39;d rather get on with the story. He <i>had</i> script, direction, and acting - it just wasn&#39;t focussed on the very small area of &#39;how calm and collected is he&#39;. More specifically, everything we saw of Radagast was of him in a panic (or near enough); the lack of grooming lets us know that he&#39;s always a bit out of things, rather than being that way just because he&#39;s panicking. Having a five-minute scene of him being scatterbrained in normal circumstances would have thrown the pacing off, neh?<br><br>Yes, it was <i>over the top</i> - bird dropping in the hair - but it wasn&#39;t <i>bad</i>, I don&#39;t think. So to that extent it was &#39;lazy&#39; - exaggerating the visual to give us a bit of information we could have had through more subtle costuming - but, y&#39;know, that <i>is</i> film. If you don&#39;t trust that your audience will notice his hair is a bit tangled, you throw bird poo at him. The dwarves were fairly played-up visually, too (&quot;I am Dwalin. I have tattoos and drink ALE. Hello Mr. Baggins.&quot;).<br><br><i>I think at least ten of his fifteen-ish minutes were spent on that hedgehog, anyway.</i><br><br>And I bet there will be Sebastian fanfic before the week is out. :P The hedgehog was there for two purposes: to get across &#39;wildly involved in animals&#39;, and to do whatever they were doing with the spiders. No, doc, I have <i>no</i> idea what was up with &#39;Magic! Spiders! The magipoison draws them near and they come from the Stronghold! Aaaaah!&#39;. I&#39;d forgotten that in amongst everything else.<br><br><i>What&#39;s really confusing me here, and the source of my feeling that maybe I&#39;m on another planet or something, is that lots of people seem to be saying this movie was awesome, they really loved it, it&#39;s better than (at least some of) the LotR movies, etc., in spite of its flaws.</i><br><br>I would say: the movie was <i>fun</i> (and funny in places), less enraging than at least Two Towers - see Haldir-related comments on canon - and, yes, awesome to watch. I think the difference may be that you and I were expecting different films - you seem to have been wanting to watch an epic fantasy, whereas I was anticipating something even more children&#39;s-book-like than what we got.<br><br><i>I mean, just to continue with this one point as an example, you agree that Radagast&#39;s character is a stereotype,</i><br><br>I think <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=234681;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">doctorlit</a> explains this better (more concisely) than I could, so I wont&#39; try to repeat it. :P<br><br><i>that it&#39;s bad for quick visuals to trump writing,</i><br><br>Yes - but as gone into at length above, I don&#39;t think this happened. I think they used a quick visual to convey one aspect of a character - his nature in peace-time - that would otherwise require restructuring an entire scene.<br><br><i>that it&#39;s dumb to have him witness the corruption of the Greenwood in real time,</i><br><br>Yep. But I don&#39;t know what they plan to do with that. It&#39;s not dumb <i>per se</i> to have Greenwood be corrupted virtually overnight - it&#39;s just that this is the wrong time for it. So that comes down to a canon break, not Radagast specifically. And I did say that I disapprove of what they&#39;ve done with the non-Hobbit-book canon material.<br><br><i>that the stick-insect moment was bizarre,</i><br><br>But funny. :P &#39;Oh, it&#39;s not a thought - it&#39;s a stick insect&#39;. And this is a film that focusses more on humour than LotR did - but not by turning specific characters into comic relief, thank Varda. Wait, thank Vana, she&#39;s probably the closest thing to a Muse of Comedy in Arda (Springtime, right?).<br><br><i>and that he was overall jarring,</i><br><br>Did I? I don&#39;t think I meant to agree with that. :P He would certainly have been jarring in LotR, but so would most of the dwarves - especially The Stupid One (actually, <i>he</i> was more jarring, back at the Party. I&#39;m kind of glad I don&#39;t know which one was wrecked that way) - but that&#39;s epic fantasy, and this isn&#39;t... not quite.<br><br>It&#39;s a different film series, and while Radagast is quite... strange to someone expecting LotR-style realism (hyperfast rabbits?), he&#39;s certainly no Jar-Jar. He may (I&#39;m speculating here) have been aimed at the younger members of the audience - or he may have been an attempt to write a character who isn&#39;t actually in the books into someone amusing yet important - or he may have been both.<br><br>Or neither. I&#39;unno.<br><br><i>but you still liked him, or at least didn&#39;t mind him. Was there really something so good about him that it overcomes the flaws?</i><br><br>I liked him. He was funny, and he doesn&#39;t discord with my ideas of how Radagast should be. Not to say he exactly matches what I would have expected, but he isn&#39;t in active <i>opposition</i> to what I would picture. That doesn&#39;t appear to be the same for you, which I suspect is where the difference lies.<br><br>It comes back to Haldir o Rohan, really. Phobos didn&#39;t mind Elves at the Hornburg because he was more concerned with how the story hung together in isolation than with how it fitted (or rather didn&#39;t fit) with the original canon. I don&#39;t object to Radagast because I see him more as a portrayal of how the book character might be rendered into film than as a dissertation on perfection in filmmaking.<br><br>Or, honestly? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m making this up as I go along. All I really know is, when it wasn&#39;t butchering the backstory, I enjoyed the film.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s true, I was expecting something more LotR-esque. But since the movie itself put that in my head, I can hardly be blamed for it. {= P I mean, they went to such lengths to use the same music, set it right before the trilogy starts, lay on the cameos and callbacks, and include all the heavy, serious stuff associated with the return of Sauron.<br><br>Also, I guess we interpreted Bilbo&#39;s voiceover differently. Where, based on something you said elsewhere, I think you heard &quot;Frodo, you&#39;re not quite an adult yet, so I&#39;m going to tell this story to you with lots of funny bits so it&#39;s not too much for you,&quot; I heard &quot;Frodo, you&#39;re darn near an adult now, so I&#39;m going to tell this story to you like it really happened, with the gritty realism you couldn&#39;t have handled when you were younger <s>and whatever canon-warping nonsense PJ has thrown in</s>.&quot;<br><br>I figured we&#39;d have scarier Trolls, Goblins less willing to have polite conversations about trespassing and more interested in chopping off limbs, Dwarves that aren&#39;t quite so bumbling and silly that they get captured multiple times without any fight, etc. And that did happen to a degree. So the would-be-funny bits (which are very low-brow/childish for the most part, IMO), really didn&#39;t sit well with me, especially when they involved bad CG to boot. Humor in a drama is fine, but I felt like I was watching a cartoon aimed at five-year-olds half the time. &quot;lol, Troll snot! lol, Troll butts! lol, the Great Goblin/Bombur fell on everyone and it is funny because he is fat! lol, Radagast has a bug in his mouth for no reason! lol, salad is yucky! lol, dissociative identity disorder is silly!&quot;<br><br>Okay, that last one is an old gripe of mine, and the two personalities thing <i>does</i> work to explain why Gollum/Smeagol agrees to a friendly game of riddles here. Unfortunately, it&#39;s also a bit of a canon break, since the &quot;Smeagol&quot; side doesn&#39;t really emerge until he meets Frodo years later—because Frodo is actually decent and kind to him, as I recall. And everything would work just fine without making light of personality disorders with a little frigging finesse.<br><br>But I digress.<br><br>Anyway. I guess that explains it? I don&#39;t like the ham-handed dumbing down of complex ideas done for the lulz and/or under the assumption that the audience is too thick to understand anything less?<br><br>As for Radagast in particular, what doctorlit says makes sense, but I guess at the time I found everything else about him too distracting to appreciate the parts where he was being competent. Also, we were pretty forcefully set up to see him as a buffoon after Gandalf had his line: &quot;Well, I think he&#39;s a very <s><i>special</i></s> great wizard... in his own way...&quot; and then we cut to ten minutes of panic and fuss over a sickeningly cutesy CG hedgehog. That thing is straight out of <i>Once Upon a Forest</i>, if you ask me. Why Radagast didn&#39;t have access to lungwort and eyebright, I cannot fathom.<br><br>And I didn&#39;t understand the spiders, either. What, they&#39;ve only just now appeared? Have they been hiding in Dol Guldur the whole time up until now? What <i>have</i> Thranduil&#39;s people had to do for sport without spiders to hunt?<br><br>... This post is getting silly and long, so I think I&#39;ll end it here. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>18 may not be the most mature of life-stages, but I think most of us are up to hearing/reading/watching serious stories without body fluid jokes and such to keep us entertained by then.

            <p>I see what you all are saying about the changes - and some of them are more irritating than others, but I have learned with PJ to view movies as a rather AU fanfic rather than straight translations of books to the screen... so I don&#39;t get so worked up over all the differences.  It&#39;s oodles better than the Two Towers, and I am glad for that. :)<br><br>____________________________(copied from my LJ)<br><br>I actually loved the movie quite a bit - though I tend to like almost everything I see in the theater, and my opinion may change a couple years down the road as I keep watching and rewatching it. <br><br>I would rate it 9/10 as a movie, and 5.5/10 as Tolkien adaptation. <br><br> I think what the movie does beautifully is show Bilbo&#39;s character development, and build Dwarves into really sympathetic characters, though there really was no opportunity for most of the Dwarves to develop a personality. Really only Thorin, Bofur and Balin get much speaking time, and out of the rest of them only Dwalin and Kili get a chance to do something more...<br>Thorin is not quite the book&#39;s Thorin in terms of his looks, though I think the personality of the Prince in Exile was captured quite well. And movie!Thorin is one hot Dwarf. The only character in the movie I really wanted to fangirl. <br><br>The prologue with Bilbo and Frodo - I think it was unnecessary, but I can understand PJ&#39;s desire to connect this movie to the previous ones for the non-Tolkienite audience. It does work, so I am not against it. <br><br>The Erebor part of the prologue did bring out sarcasm in me. I do buy into the idea that it was a great and powerful kingdom, but not to such an extent. Dwarves did not even live there for that long, with moving to the Grey Mountains and then back... I intensely disliked them showing Thranduil coming to pay homage to Thror... as if!!! I should also say I don&#39;t like PJ&#39;s vision of the caves - any of them. Makes me wonder if he has ever seen a real cave. <br><br>I did love how the Smaug&#39;s attack was shown. And his lovely tail. The pinkish tint to his red color made me wonder what a hot pink Smaug would look like. What I did not like is that the Elves arrived there to watch the attack (how did they get there so quickly?) and then watched until it was all over - then turned around and left. At least they did not applaud... I simply don&#39;t get why PJ wanted to amplify the dislike between Dwarves and Elves to such an extent. Makes me really wonder how he is going to show the whole Mirkwood portion of the movie... <br><br>I liked the Bilbo-Gandalf meeting scene, and how at times they quoted the book directly. While hobbit-hole being overrun by Dwarves was slightly different from the book - it was quite well done. And I *love* Dwarven singing. I loved it in the trailer and I loved in the movie. <br><br>Bilbo&#39;s decision to join the group is all his own, without Gandalf&#39;s interference (though here he did not have to clean up after Dwarves&#39; breakfast - that could make a difference ), but dynamics between him and the Dwarves is more based on the Unfinished Tales and the Quest for Erebor than on the Hobbit book itself. <br><br>The whole Troll scene plays out rather different from the book in the beginning (though the end is the same). The Trolls were rather sympathetic in their own way, I must say, and their culinary discussion reminded me of the Ratatouille a bit. I actually liked that the Dwarves were more battle-ready than in the book, though why were they so incompetent? Was that the first time they ever encountered a troll, or what? <br><br>I liked the realistic depiction of their cave - with the flies and the stench, but the Elvish swords made me wonder. Why did the Sting glow blue but not Glamdring and Orcrist? They are all three made in Gondolin... Sure, the books don&#39;t specifically mentino Glamdring or Orcrist glowing, but is that the question of Aragorn&#39;s pants or is there something more to it? I invented a theory that maybe Bilbo&#39;s sword, being small in size but shaped more like a sword than a dagger, was a child&#39;s sword. And that&#39;s why it glowed - a child may not be able to discern approaching orcs, but an adult elf should be able to. <br><br>The battle of Azanulbizar was shown as a flashback and on the whole I rather disliked it as a Tolkien adaptation, though it does fit with the way PJ wanted to build the movie. The story was told by Balin to Bilbo and Fili and Kili - I am surprised those two did not know it, being his own nephews. Sure, they were too young to have taken a part in it - but surely they have heard it many times before. I was disappointed that there was some random battle cry instead of the famed Baruk Khazad! - probably because most of the Dwarves, for whatever reason, used weapons other than axes? I also disliked how the battle flow was shown. Azog beheaded Thror - Thrain instantly went mad - Dwarves started running in panic instead of going to avenge their king. Then Thorin did remember he was a Prince and a Hero and attacked Azog (I understand not introducing Nain and Dain here, there is barely time to develop the major characters). Somehow ended up without a sword or a shield (I always imagined that he lost his shield when it simply ended up cracked by taking too many strikes in the course of the long battle!) and defended himself with an oak branch (more like oak fireplace log!) and then managed to chop off Azog&#39;s hand (not the head). Also, I couldn&#39;t help laughing every time I head The Pale Orc - made me think of Die Blonde Bestie... <br><br>Even though Dwarves have won the battle, there were not enough of them left alive to retake Moria and so they had to remain exiled homeless people. And Azog became the main enemy of this movie (and possibly movie Number 2 and maybe even Number 3 since he is left alive at the end of this particular movie. He also put a price on Thorin&#39;s head and sent out his Orcs to hunt for him - while camping out on Amon Sul. Made me wonder how Dunedain allowed that - then I remembered that in the Jackson&#39;s version of Middle-earth they do not exist. <br><br>Radagast episodes were not as annoying as they could have been, though I think they were quite unnecessary nonetheless. I think the story of Dol Guldur could have been retold by Gandalf, as in the book - even if they wanted to show it as a new development instead of a 400-year old story it was... Cutesy animal scenes I did not care for. <br><br>I intensely disliked the Dwarves being chased into Rivendell by the Orcs. First the incompetent Dwarves who can&#39;t dispose of the single Orc scout with less that six or so blows, allowing him ample time to alert everyone. Then Elrond and his little army riding out to fight the Orcs who have crossed!!! Bruinen!!! and not even managing to slay all of them... <br><br>Elrond was the same rather grouchy movie!Elrond and mockingly fed the Dwarves only salad accompanied by Elvish music. The White Council was taking place in Rivendell at the same time Dwarves were there. I suppose it is OK for it to be held there - I don&#39;t think books specify where it had taken place... even if I personally have a hard time imagining Saruman leaving Orthanc willingly by that time... What I have an issue with is why the Council discussed Thorin&#39;s merry band instead of Dol Guldur. And the idiotic phrase about 400 years of peace - where was that peace, pardon me? And where the heck did you get the 400 year mark from? What the scene did show well was the dynamics of Gandalf+Galadriel vs Saruman. Galadriel was the same as in LotR - though I liked here a bit better here than in FotR. The little nitpicky things - her silver nail polish (did not know Elvish manicure techniques were that advanced) and that she was only at most an inch taller than Gandalf, instead of good 10-12 inches... <br><br>I had no problems with pacing of the movie (some critics complained it was rather slow) up to this point, but after Rivendell I did have many issues with it. The battle of the mountains coming to life (Storm Giants, they called them in the movie) was utterly unnecessary, full of cheap CGI and far too long. The other scene that was far too long was the whole running through the Goblin Town. <br><br>I really liked the conversation between Bilbo and Bofur on the steps of the Goblin Town. I think it is a key scene for the movie!Bilbo character development and a very strong scene in and of itself. In the Goblin town itself, I missed the song - that was the one thing I really liked in the Rankin-Bass cartoon... The King was ugly but not so ugly as to distract from the proceedings. The whole scene should have been edited to about half its length, especially the part after Gandalf rescues the Dwarves. Though I really liked the one minor detail - the scribe! <br><br>Almost every reviewer I have read so far has loved the Riddles scene. I must say I did not find it that impressive - maybe because it was interspersed with the chase through the Goblin town? Gollum is very good, but really quite the same as we have seen him in TTT and RotK. The Gollum scene I really loved was the one at the very end, where Bilbo was thinking whether to kill Gollum, and poor Smeagol was so crushed by the loss of the ring...<br><br>Then the famous flaming fir cones battle took place. It was not too bad, but I rather disliked one change PJ has made. Thorin jumped out of the tree to fight Azog - OK, that part I can buy, it is not out of character for him. What I refuse to buy is that no one, not even Fili and Kili, followed him - but Bilbo Baggins the Amazing Fighting Hobbit did. And even was more successful against the warg-riding Orcs than the warrior Thorin. The only reason for this scene to be there, I suppose, is that they could then show Thorin finally accepting Bilbo as the member of his company, but I still did not care for it. <br><br>The Eagles did come but they really did not talk. They simply deposited them all atop Carrock and left. The final few moments were quite well done...<br>I am looking forward to seeing the movie at least one more time, and to the two films that follow. After FotR, I had very high hopes for TTT which unfortunately were sorely disappointed - I hope with the second Hobbit movie it will not be the case.</p>

            <p>I saw the movie last night and I have to say that I probably would have liked it more if I hadn&#39;t read the book first. Overall it&#39;s a good movie, but all the canon discrepancies really detracted from my enjoyment of the film.<br>The biggest thing that bothered me was Radagast. I&#39;m not really sure what I was expecting from him, but that was definitely not it. We&#39;re talking about a wizard who&#39;s supposed to be at about the same level as Gandalf, but they made him seem like just some reclusive loony who enjoys mushrooms a bit too much. I also was somewhat bothered by that fact that even though Bilbo was the main character the focus wasn&#39;t really on him as much as it was on Gandalf.<br>Other minor bothers include the lack of new music, Thranduil on a moose, and at the very end when the eagles just drop them off on a mountain in the middle of nowhere.<br>I think that the underlying issue is that they tried to direct The Hobbit in the same way that they directed The <br>Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit was originally written as a children&#39;s book, while The Lord of the Rings is a lot darker and more complex, so trying to direct them the same way is just looking for failure. <br>Just one last random little tidbit: even though Smaug didn&#39;t speak once Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s name is still in the credits. I have no idea why, maybe he voice-acted the roars? :D   Just the thought of that is hilarious to me</p>

            <p>I won&#39;t speak to what I thought of it as a Tolkien adaptation, because I haven&#39;t read The Hobbit since the late 90&#39;s.  What I will talk about is how this stacked up as a movie.<br><br>Let me break down what I thought.  The pacing was atrocious.  There was no time to breathe between some action sequences and yet there were large portions of the film that were, to me, composed of useless filler.  They needed to use their time more effectively.  For instance, after three hours, I still had no idea who most of the Dwarfs were.  I knew Thorin, Fili, Kili, Bofur, Balin and Dwalin.  That&#39;s it.  Out of 13 Dwarves, I could identify six.  The rest will have to get used to being &quot;the fat one&quot; or &quot;the one with the funny hair&quot;.  Cut some of the sweeping panoramic views and use that time to flesh out the characters.<br><br>I would also like to address the crap job that they did with the CG in the movie.  I mean, we have seen what CG can do, and this was absolutely sub-par.  Thranduil on the moose (don&#39;t even get me started on the moose) at the beginning looked plastic.  I&#39;m not even sure if there is an actor behind all of that.  The CG, throughout the movie, was obvious and without restraint.  If you have millions of dollars to spend on CG, you&#39;d damn well better get your money&#39;s worth.  The CG in Lord of the Rings was better than this, and that was made a decade ago.  Shouldn&#39;t we be better now than we were back then?<br><br>One of my biggest disappointments was that they reused so much of the music from the Lord of the Rings movies.  I was looking forward to a lot of new, awesome music but we mainly got rehashes of the same themes, with the exception of the Lonely Mountain song that the Dwarfs sang early on, which was everything I was hoping for.  Then they played that over and over and over again until I got sick of hearing it.  Then there was the random Isengard bad guy music that they played when Thorin was being badass near the end.  It made no sense and I expect better.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s get down to the biggest problem I had with the film.  It has no idea what it wants to be.  It is trying to be both a serious action/adventure and a light-hearted cartoon.  The problem is that it doesn&#39;t do either one very well.  Each action scene went on way too long and then, like I said earlier, slammed right into the next action scene without any real break.  As for the light-hearted cartoon, all the jokes were cliched and you could see them coming a mile away.  Some of them were even stuck into sections where they were trying to be dramatic, which completely destroyed both purposes.<br><br>So, overall, I have to give the movie 4.5/10 as a film.  It isn&#39;t the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen, but it wasn&#39;t even near the standard that Lord of the Rings set.<br><br>-Phobos, Theatre Professional</p>

            <p>With the exception of the Lonely Mountain track; I&#39;m still humming it two days later.<br><br>1) The fight scenes all lasted <i>forever</i>, and every single one was overdramatised to an absurd degree - after the fourth ZOMG CLIMAX OF THORIN LOOKING LIKE A DRAMATIC WARRIOR, it starts to get really old.<br><br>2) Gandalf, love him though I do, was basically a deus ex machina. Rather than defeating the trolls by cleverness, he defeats them by magicking a rock. Rather than the eagles finding them by pure luck, Gandalf calls them with his moth-summoning powers. Rather than slipping through the crack in the back of the cave, and then spending hours on a &quot;very touch-and-go&quot; flash-bang, he just sort of POOF! Does it. I could forgive every other part of the CG issues, but this changes the nature of the story by taking the rag-tag by-the-skin-of-their-teeth luck-and-cleverness of the group, and making them Super Powerful Awesome Wizardly Ones.<br><br>3) RADAGAST. For pity&#39;s sake, isn&#39;t he <i>on</i> the White Council? Ridiculous. Utterly unforgivable. Seriously. They could&#39;ve fit Beorn in by cutting out the &quot;Look at the crazy smelly hippie wizard!&quot; bits (and the over-dramatic cuts to Azog), which brings me to my next point:<br><br>4) Azog. <i>Seriously</i> over-used. I get that PJ is trying to set him up as the Big Bad, but in the book, IIRC, he&#39;s given one or two mentions, and is off sorta doing his own thing. Not... going on a dwarven man-hunt. It&#39;s freaking ridiculous. The story works so much better when he&#39;s hidden.<br><br>5) On the bright side: the scene with Bilbo and Gollum was excellent.<br><br>6) Also, Lindir! Lindir got a speaking part, and that was cool. Made me think of Boz.<br><br>I&#39;d have to say, my biggest problem is definitely the narrative changes. The Hobbit isn&#39;t the story to be told like Lord of the Rings, with the epic drama, and the Warrior King, and the Mysteriously Apparating Galadriel (SERIOUSLY WHAT WAS THAT), and the Dramatic Close-ups, and the Thranduil On an Elk (pretty sure that was an elk)... it&#39;s really just poor directing choices. Which is a shame.<br><br>I&#39;d give it more of a 4.</p>

            <p>The funny thing is, I&#39;ve spent so much time mentally preparing myself, the canon departures alone, where they aren&#39;t part of greater storytelling issues, don&#39;t really bother me so much. For instance, I don&#39;t mind that Gandalf didn&#39;t outsmart the trolls, because Bilbo did it instead. He is the main character, after all; I thought that was appropriate.<br><br>Unfortunately, that&#39;s one of the very few important things he does. I felt like he was barely there most of the time, which is really sad when the film is called &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; I realize he comes into his own and steps up more later, but we should have been with him and feeling how uncomfortable he is with all this adventuring business in the meantime. Like Phobos said, we needed a lot less panoramic shots and chases and bad CG and a lot more character development. On the plus side, agreed that the Riddles in the Dark bit was good, though I&#39;m still not a fan of Split Personality!Gollum. Nor &quot;disease of the mind&quot;!Thror, for that matter. Yes, I know they&#39;re setting up for Thorin losing it over the Arkenstone later, but that still doesn&#39;t excuse making out like Smaug turned up because there was something wrong with Thror (as opposed to, y&#39;know, the heaps and heaps of treasure).<br><br>And that brings me to the fact that I&#39;m totally with you on Radagast. I am a fan of Radagast, and this did not make me happy. Rather, it made me a little uncomfortable, like making fun of the mentally ill, and the bird poo didn&#39;t help, either. The one good thing about him was the &quot;Rhosgobel rabbits&quot; line, because that&#39;s as close as they got to a recluse who&#39;s a little odd and out of context most of the time, but absolutely in his element when it comes to animals. The sledge was horribly CG&#39;d and probably completely impractical, though. And I&#39;m terribly confused about when Radagast&#39;s scenes at Rhosgobel and Dol Guldur are meant to have happened. They couldn&#39;t touch the canon timeline with a ten foot pole, of course, but I don&#39;t even know when they happened in relation to the movie timeline. O.o<br><br>As for Azog, he actually ought to be dead at this time, by the canon. I know this because I&#39;d had him mixed up with the Great Goblin before the movie, so I had to look them up to set myself straight last night. Turns out Azog was in fact slain by Dain Ironfoot, who avenged the death of Thror in that battle for Moria. The guy who shows up at the Battle of Five Armies is Azog&#39;s son, Bolg. The Great Goblin (source of inappropriate cartoon humor #47 in the film) has nothing to do with either of them.<br><br>Anyway, Azog in any form has no business being a Big Bad. We&#39;ve got enough to worry about between Smaug and the Necromancer, not to mention Trolls, Stone Giants, Goblins, etc., etc. What is he <i>doing</i> there, besides taking up valuable storytelling time with over the top dramatics? I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Also, may I just mention the number of forced callbacks to LotR? The one that sticks out to me the most is Saruman just about word for word repeating his &quot;your [Gandalf&#39;s] love of the halfling&#39;s leaf has clearly clouded your mind,&quot; only substitute mushrooms for pipeweed and Radagast for Gandalf. &gt;.<br>Will say I liked the Wargs better in this movie. They looked more like wolves and less like hyenas. And the bit where Gandalf says he&#39;s forgotten the names of the Blue Wizards was good. And I also like the Lonely Mountain/Dwarf Theme music. I was relieved to get a break from recycled LotR themes every time it came up.<br><br>I also don&#39;t have a problem with them trying to tell a more <i>Lord of the Rings</i>-esque story here. The way I see it, they had two choices: try to tell the story like it is in the book and have a serious tonal difference between these movies and the LotR trilogy that might turn people off, or try to tell the story more like LotR, with the Dwarves, the quest, and the dangers a bit more serious. The trouble is, they tried not only to do both, but to ramp everything up to eleven, and it fell on its face.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>PS. You&#39;re right, it might&#39;ve been an elk. That would make slightly more sense, which I suppose is why my brain turned it into a moose.</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s a consequence of PJ deciding to turn a short book into three films, as opposed to what he did with LotR. Now that he&#39;s got three three-hour long films to air, he doesn&#39;t heve to cut out a thing.<br>(unless there&#39;s an extended edition of what already sounds like an extended edition of a book but whatever)<br><br>And oh man, I&#39;m not looking forward to the badfics.

            <p>So I&#39;m taking a creative writing class in school and one of our assignments was to write a flash-fiction story. My teacher has said that he&#39;ll give us extra credit if we submit the story to a literary magazine in order to (possibly) get published. He&#39;s not expecting any of us to get published, because that that would be unreasonably high hopes for a group of 14-18 year olds, but even so I have decided that if I am going to submit a story to a professional magazine I would like to have it be proofread by someone other than my sister.If any of you are interested in helping me out, I put the story on Google Docs, so just give me your e-mail address and I&#39;ll send you a link </p>

            <p>The Hobbit Badfic Post!<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5639577/1/The-quest-for-Tashadar-s-orb">The quest for Tashadar&#39;s orb</a>, rated T.<br>-Bilbo bagins is offered by a stranger to join him, in a long quest for an ancient artifact which had the power to save his city from Sauron&#39;s evil forces;he accepts,and begins his journey.He finally finds it, and keeps it for itself...the rest is story<br>-Sounds like a Stu to me, unless this Tashadar person is from another continuum. Any bells? <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8797930/1/The-Half-Elf">The Half-Elf</a>, rated M<br>-Elena is a the girl who needs no one. Much like Thorin Oakenshield. When she is transported to another world, her strength will be tested. Love will blossom and friendships forged as she joins Thorin&#39;s company on their quest to the Lonely Mountain. Will she discover who she truly is? Rated M for language, Strong romance, alcohol consumption, and violence. Some Movie scenes!<br>-I have no bloody clue what&#39;s going on other than there&#39;s a 15th walker and she yells a lot. Also, she&#39;s a half-elf and 19... years... old? I&#39;m fairly certain aging for half-elves is very different than for humans... ALSO GRELVISH. MY EARS ARE BLEEDING. <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8456318/1/Pet">Pet</a>, rated K+<br>-The very same day Gandalf visits Bilbo for the first time seeking someone with whom he can share in an adventure, a brave clueless teenager falls headfirst into Bilbos life, seeking an adventure of her own.<br>-WHY OH WHY IS SHE CALLED PET I know it&#39;s short for Petunia but THAT IS THE WORST NICKNAME EVER IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEONE&#39;S PROPERTY. Also, she... er... got sucked into Middle-earth. Yeah. (this one you might want to keep on surveillance; it&#39;s not as bad as the others but it might go there...)<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8741102/1/Ivy-s-Angel">Ivy&#39;s Angel</a>, rated K+<br>-When Ivy is transported to middle earth she quickly falls in love with Legolas, who swears to protect her and love her forever. But when she and Frodo are kidnapped by souroman, He must find a way to save her<br>-This got filed into the wrong section I think. But still, it&#39;s painful to look at. Also... souroman? Sounds like some new type of sour candy.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8795767/1/Devil-Take-The-Hindmost">Devil Take The Hindmost</a>, rated T<br>-Diana Scott finally gets to see &quot;The Hobbit&quot; at the midnight premiere. But when a voice claiming to belong to the evil Sauron apparentally sends her to Middle-Earth to change the fate of The Company, she finds herself falling in love with the two men Sauron wants most to destroy.<br>-Why the everloving frick would <i>Sauron</i> ever send her to Middle-earth?!<br><br>This was reported before, but I thought I&#39;d put it here again:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5637531/1/There-and-Back-Again">There and Back Again</a>, rated K+<br>-Erudessa Nuneth works for Bilbo Baggins and has done so for many years. She goes along with him on his great adventure to the Lonely Mountain. But there is more to this girl than meets the eye. She carries a deep secret that only one of the company knows.<br>-Why is she Bilbo&#39;s maid? Why is she an elf in the Shire? Why is she bossing the Dwarves around? Why is she packing inappropriate foods for the quest? WHY IS SHE EVEN GOING ON THE QUEST AT ALL?! Just... why.<br><br>Also, this gem from the LotR section:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2192271/1/LOTR-Ariannas-Story">LOTR: Ariannas Story</a>, rated T<br>-Follows through the LOTR, Arianna joins the fellowship on their quest.<br>-Well, this one follows just about every LotR Sue cliché to ever exist, including: hails from non-Middle-earthian kingdom, is the princess of said kingdom, creating mini-Balrogs, wait what the hell is Sauron doing what what NO STOP. I think DOGA needs to tackle her; she seems to hop around Middle-earth like each place is a stone-throw away.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>...doing this just for kicks because math is comprised of large quantities of Fun. <br><br>If we assume that the number of people (and thus fanfic authors) who have seen <i>The Hobbit</i> grows exponentially <s>because linear growth is no fun</s>, we can hypothetically model the growth in the number of <i>Hobbit</i> fics in the Pit using the following equation: <br><br>A = Ao*e<sup>-kt</sup><br><br>Where A is the current amount of fics, Ao is the initial amount, e is the natural number, k is the function&#39;s growth constant, and t is the time (in days) passed. Plugging in:<br><br>A= 153<br>Ao= 106<br>t= 5<br><br>We can calculate -k is equal to 0.0734. Re-plugging this into the equation and setting t = 19 (5 days + 14 days until New Year&#39;s), we obtain A= 428, rounded up.<br><br>Which is still a fearsome number of potential sporkable fics by any standards. I&#39;d still like to see 1000 before New Year&#39;s: think of all the <s>horror</s> joys of snarking at badfic!</p>

            <p>Mathematics is simply another language to be learned, and mastering it gives you a powerful method of understanding the workings of the physical world. <br><br>For example, you can show that 0.999 repeating is <u>exactly</u> equal to 1* or demonstrate that a certain shape can have infinite surface area while having finite volume** using math. <br><br><br>* Knowing that 1/3 = 0.333 repeating, multiplying each side by three gives us<br>3 * 1/3 = 3 * 0.333 repeating<br>so 3/3 = 0.999 repeating<br>therefore 1 = 0.999 repeating.<br><br>**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel's_Horn"> See the Gabriel&#39;s Horn paradox.</a><br></p>

            <p>&quot;What is this?&quot; demanded Rooney, staring at his screen in the Sorting Room in horror. Thanks to the fanfic explosion in the Hobbit fandom, he and his new colleague Jeeves had been relocated out of BBC Sherlock for the Duration. Eru knew how long said Duration would last, but it certainly seemed like a long haul for now.<br><br>&quot;...I do not want to know,&quot; Jeeves replied, only looking over for a second before capturing his Morbid Curiosity once again and banishing it in a crate to Timbuktu. &quot;Is it as bad as all of these Fifteenth Questor Sues I&#39;m finding here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, it&#39;s not,&quot; snapped Rooney.<br><br>Jeeves raised an eyebrow.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s worse.&quot; <br><br>Jeeves huffed. &quot;Really.&quot;<br><br>The older - but not by far - Spy waved a hand. &quot;Remember that quick information session they sprung on us about &#39;Legendary Badfics&#39;, and how one of them detailed the, er, sexually explicit adventures of Lord Elrond&#39;s wife during her captivity with the Orcs?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still have nightmares about it,&quot; Jeeves deadpanned.<br><br>&quot;Yes, well.&quot; Rooney rolled his eyes. &quot;This, my friend, is the Hobbit version of that.&quot;<br><br>There was a pause. <br><br>&quot;<i>What</i> are they doing to Bilbo?!&quot; demanded Jeeves.<br><br>Rooney shook his head. &quot;Not Bilbo, Kili.&quot;<br><br>Another pause. Jeeves took a breath, and put his head in his hands. &quot;Those poor sods who made those films had no idea what they&#39;ve unleashed by creating attractive Dwarves, huh,&quot; he mumbled, rubbing his temples. <br><br>&quot;If they did, they wouldn&#39;t have made such a mistake,&quot; replied Rooney sagely.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s an in-post piece, from the Department of Intelligence.<br><br>*****<br><br>Amber Dashel was one of the few Intel Agents who still worked from her RC. She liked it that way, mostly because the sounds of other people trying to deal with what had come up on their screens put her off. A lot. It was much more peaceful in her room as she scanned, assigned and investigated fics (although that bit wasn&#39;t always so peaceful, even if she was fairly good at keeping out of sight).<br><br>On this particular day, she&#39;d just got back from a quick lunch, bringing with her a coffee that was actually drinkable once she&#39;d added about ten pots of creamer, and sat down at the console when it went off with one of the most ear-splitting <b>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]</b>s she had ever heard.<br><br>She shrieked, managed to upset the lukewarm coffee down herself, and fumbled for the mute button only for the sound to be replaced by a klaxon-like wailing. A message flashed up on the screen.<br><br><b>[Calling all Spies. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has been released in World One cinemas. We have already received reports of major activity on fanfic websites. Get in there and start investigating! The Action Departments will kill them as fast as resources and weaponry permit. This is a FANFIC EXPLOSION, people! Thank you.<br><br>The Sub Rosa.]</b><br><br>Amber stared at the screen, and then groaned and sank her face into her hands. &quot;Well,&quot; she muttered eventually, &quot;at least I&#39;m not going to get bored.&quot;</p>

            <p>That Zeus and Hera were siblings. Also, besides the fact that you so eloquently capslocked, Apollo and Artemis obviously have an arguing brother/sister relationship in the third book. Yeah.</p>

            <p>Well, given that there are no half-elves as such in Middle-earth - after the First Age anyone with mixed blood is automatically an average human unless he/she is technically an Elf but happens to have human blood (Arwen and her brothers).  But known examples of half-elves from the First Age aged just like normal humans (Earendil, Elwing - Dior too, but with Dior the question is still open whether he counts as a half-elf or a full human, I am leaning towards the latter). <br><br>As far as why Sauron would send a Sue into Middle-earth?  Sauron is evil.  Inflicting Mary Sues onto unsuspecting words is evil.  Bingo!  </p>

Well, I am here to both confirm and disprove that theory for I have a nickname that gives me both the world and the garbage that nobody wants .I Have a Nickname and that is, The Nobody.&quot;<br>-Another reason to hate the Circle of Lemmings is that it lets you just put videos in the middle of the story. It&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know why anyone would just put the video for the Hobbit trailer after they say they&#39;re going to watch it. Also, why is she watching the trailer instead of the actual movie? <br>Basically, Sue is bullied because she likes reading and then  gets sucked into Middle-Earth. Becomes a Fifteenth Walker, has angst issues about her name and consistently calls Gandalf &quot;Gandulf&quot;. Fun. And Thorin has this creepy father complex for her and calls her &quot;my child&quot;, wtf.<br><br>All the rest are LotR, but they&#39;re equally bad. They kinda remind me of the Sues from the Original Series, just because they&#39;re so stereotyped and bleeegh. I can&#39;t speak anymore. </p>

            <p>I see you have based the corridors on the PPC HQ theory - always fun. I suppose, then, that the only way a fangirl could reach the room of their LO would be to not be thinking about their LO - so very good security, there.<br><br>Ah, and Spock teaching logic - I wonder if fangirls and logic actually mix (because &#39;Sues and logic don&#39;t)?<br><br>I can&#39;t wait for a few more classes and the fangirl plots to begin. I also agree with Lily - if you can make the chapters longer, please do, because I am (and probably a good number of others are) really enjoying this.<br><br>Also, if your beta gets ill again, you can always ask here on the Board.</p>

            <p><i>John nudged Sherlock.<br>&quot;What?&quot; the detective snapped, not looking up from his experiment.<br>&quot;Say happy birthday to Lily,&quot; his friend told him.<br>&quot;Why? I&#39;m in the middle of something.&quot;<br>&quot;Because that&#39;s what you do when someone has a birthday.&quot;<br>&quot;Social conventions. Dull. Go away.&quot;<br>&quot;Just say it, okay? Show some appreciation for the person who created MBSFA!&quot;<br>&quot;Fine,&quot; he said. &quot;Happy Birthday, Lily. Happy now, John?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes. But I&#39;d be even happier if you cleaned up the flat and got those Sue parts out of the fridge…&quot;<br>&quot;No.&quot;</i><br><br>Boring mission? What boring mission? I clicked on the link and it brought me to an interesting, well-written mission involving agents interacting with each other in amusing ways and a private plothole (only the best for Mycroft!). I think it was unique that it was a Mycroft Sue and that it was Mycroft who was character replaced. Eledhwen and Christianne are, as always, fun. Especially the bit with the tatoo.<br>I still look forward to your Circle sporking, just because I love your missions. :) Yes, I am a fangirl of your work.<br></p>

            <p>Have some concrit... and a Minecraft dog.<br><br>I have to say this mission was far from &quot;boring&quot;. It was actually very well paced and the section with Mycroft in the plothole was perfect. I liked the fact that the mission incorporated a lot of Eledhwen-Christianne interaction: it reminded me a lot of TOS. Well done! I look forward to the Circle of Lemmings mission.</p>

            <p>And you&#39;re such a selfless person, you&#39;ve given us a mission as a present on your special day!<br><br>You did an excellent job of fighting off the boring in this mission.  You gave the agents and Mycroft enough to do and deal with to keep the mission&#39;s action moving, even while the badfic&#39;s action was . . . nonexistent.<br><br>Mycroft&#39;s private plothole was quite funny.  I can almost imagine him arguing with the standard plothole to get better arrangements and see what was happening, and the plothole finally bowing down to his wishes.  I&#39;m also amused by the idea of Christianne posing as a nurse for some length of time waiting for Rosh Hashanananana to show up.<br><br>I also liked that the kids and dog all went different places to get cared for.  It helps reinforce the fact that the PPC and its close allies are dedicated to helping harmed characters, in addition to fighting those causing the harm.<br><br>I&#39;m curious about how Mycroft &quot;is&quot; the British government.  That must be a BBC <i>Sherlock</i> thing, since I don&#39;t recall him wielding that sort of power in the original Holmes adventures.</p>

            <p>And boring? What are you talking about? I thought your agents had some serious funny banter going on, espcially considering they had almost nohting to work with, except a lot of fluff.

It&#39;s supposed to be for my brother, but since I did not miss his birthday, and after-birthdays can be even more fun than the actual day, here is a certificate to one Pinkie Pie Party for one whole day! It will be insane, but if you know Pinkie, then you know how nuts it can be. No garantes you won&#39;t die in a terrible forth wall acident though.<br>(But hey, come on, how cool would it be if you were crushed under the forth wall!)<br>You&#39;re dead.<br>(Yes, but imagine millions would be *sunglasses* watching the funeral.)<br>That was a terrible joke. Still, being crushed by a immanganary force used for theater... It would be talked about for years.</p>

            <p>Well! First off, here is the link to the Bal&#39;s wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.drowtales.com/index.php/Balvhakara"><a href="http://wiki.drowtales.com/index.php/Balvhakara">http://wiki.drowtales.com/index.php/Balvhakara</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s from a webcomic called Drowtales, which I absolutely reccomend, except it&#39;s been running for over ten years and has tons of stuff to get through, and worldbuilding, and it&#39;s so freaking huge.<br><br>The Balvhakara are a clan of engineers. In the peaceful (until the current Civil War arc) city, they are the only one of the clans to actively prepare for war. Nuqrah is an extremely prosperous city, as the main clan, the Val&#39;Illhar&#39;dro, is a massive trading clan. So there&#39;s that.<br><br>The Bals make their living off warfare, apparently selling their goods to the clans that do make war, like the Val&#39;Sarghress, the Vel&#39;Sharen, and others. They make war golems (enormous mecha, pretty much) and power armor. I&#39;m not sure of the exact specs of the armor, but it has blades that extend, I&#39;m pretty sure it has mana blasts. <br><br>Want me to try and find some comic pages with the armor in it?</p>

            <p>There are 52 episodes, from three seasons (Original = 13 episodes, A&#39;s = 13 episode, StrikerS = 26 episodes), two movie adaptations (that are canonically movies in the anime-verse, propaganda-ish films that the main characters actually helped with), two ongoing mangas, two video games...

            <p>I expect that future missions in SPN will feature even more interesting executions. After all, almost anything can be used as a killing weapon in the series.

            <p>Well, if you promise that your agents won&#39;t tell my agents before I write the interlude about it, I can tell you that they are going to the All-Purpose Department, Supernatural Division. I am kinda nervous about writing more Supernatural, since I&#39;m not sure that this mission didn&#39;t feature all the best jokes I was able to come up with, but I have to try.<br><br>The scene with Dean and Sam was actually inspired by your missions in the Sherlock-canon, even though it turned out rather different. I thought it was such a great idea to have actual long interactions with the canons, rather than just: &quot;Look here.&quot; [Flash]<br><br>And I would very much like that link. Writing the extracts myself was a pain.</p>

            <p>So, way back in 7th Grade, eight years ago (My <i>God</i>, has it really been that long?) I wrote a Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus fic.  For those of you unfamiliar with the canon, the protagonist, Vincent Valentine, is already borderline-Sue.  Tragic Past, 133t powaz, red eyes, Really Cool Weapons, nigh immortality, etc.  <br><br>So yeah, fic about a near-Sue, written by a seventh grader.  WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?<br><br>At the end of the year, the notebook I&#39;d been writing it in disappeared.  Like, freaking vanished.  I&#39;ve been looking for it for years.  Because, like most other people, I tend to remember only the <i>good</i> things about my past writing.  I wanted to find it so I could continue it.<br><br>So yesterday, I finally found the notebook.  Overjoyed, can&#39;t wait to read thi-<br><br>...<br><br>.......<br><br>Oh sweet Eru, what have I done?  Purple Prose, rampant Sue-ishness, scenes stolen from Halo: Combat Evolved, shipping that made <i>NO</i> sense at all, and general horribleness.  Don&#39;t get me wrong: it&#39;s actually fairly well-written.  No SPaG issues, no awkward sentences, decent dialogue...but My God.  It&#39;s depressingly bad.<br><br>I think I&#39;ll keep it, for use as a guide to the Thou Shalt Nots of writing.  If whatever I&#39;m working on at the moment starts resembling it, it&#39;s <i>*BLAM!*</i>-ing time.<br><br>I honestly have no idea why I&#39;m posting this.  It&#39;s kind of on a whim, actually.  Make of it what you will, I suppose.</p>

            <p>Improbable seems to be a favorite word in your &quot;Thou shalt nots.&quot;<br><br>Hey, I&#39;m making my prospective agents go back and spork a story I actually once submitted to a school contest way back in sixth grade. (No wonder I only got honorable mention for having the longest and most involved story - the sue was terrible.) I guess my agents aren&#39;t really versions of those characters, so it doesn&#39;t get quite so meta, though. :)</p>

There&#39;s five fics there, and only one of them is complete. Not coincedentally, it&#39;s the only one I&#39;m even remotely proud of. But I had major plans for all of them, and I keep wanting to write something new someday. Who knows? Maybe I will...</p>

            <p>A lot of the worst stuff from grades 5-8 was wiped out in the great hard drive crash the year before I went to high school. I didn&#39;t know fanfiction existed until I was 18, so... yeah, my original fiction was terrible enough to make up for that. I just started early enough that none of my peers ever noticed, and had limited internet access until I was fifteen anyway, so I never discovered fanficiton or fictionpress until much later. <br><br>However, I have a lot of Thou Shalt Nots<br><br>- Thou shalt not assign a seperate color and font to indicate the thoughts of each character.<br>- Thou shalt not designate clip art to show transitions between points of view.<br>- Thy character shall not have been orphaned, abandoned or disowned of more than one set of parents or parental figures.<br>- Thou shalt not romanticize Epilepsy. (Yeah, that one makes me cringe worst - I don&#39;t really think I understood it at the time other than that it made for medical drama that didn&#39;t have to be life-threatening... no, wait, I&#39;d just read <i>The Last Book in the Universe</i>, and I was dumb. [and twelve, that helped too.])<br>- Thou shalt not write original characters that can be summed up as &quot;A blend of Sabriel, Ged, and Gandalf,&quot; nor shall you exceed more than one magically pulled from thine pants new power per person.<br>- Thou shalt not spend eight chapters cataloging all the obviously alien furniture in a house in order to establish that the occupant can travel between worlds. (In my defense, this story was almost a complete fanfic of Myst, except without any reference to the main plotline of that series, because I&#39;d only ever played Riven.)<br>- Thou shalt not defeat laser guns with tinfoil suits, ray-bans, sheilds made of trashcan lids, and a slip&#39;n&#39;slide.<br>- Thou shalt not introduce mystical species that have no reason other than to be a conveniently intelligent pet of your main character.<br><br>... I&#39;m sure if I actually dug that stuff up I&#39;d have more, but... </p>

            <p>I tried writing a story once, when I was in Year Nine. The plot was tacked together from whatever I thought was cool, the characters had no depth and the whole thing was completely and utterly sad. I&#39;m so glad I abandoned it.</p>

            <p>There was this one, okay three, okay three OCs and two corrupted next gen canons. In one story. And that&#39;s without mentioning Morgana&#39;s angsty backstory, Jen&#39;s telepathic manipulation skills, Sebastian&#39;s Heroic BSOD at being Sorted into Ravenclaw, Morgana&#39;s insane skillz with the shield charm, James Sirius Potter owning the invisibility cloak, Scorpius&#39; mad potions skillz, the fact that they were all Animagi or the time travel. Oh and the fact they were all basically in one big polygamous relationship.<br>It was about this time I discovered a Mary Sue litmus test and having failed spectacularly hid that notebook from the light of day.</p>

            <p>All the same, if nobody else has claimed it, you may just end up responsible for it. :)<br><br>Hmmm... I think I read the first three Charlie Bone books, but I&#39;d always been morbidly curious to find a crossover between Charlie Bone and Harry Potter. And hey, your OC&#39;s are no worse than mine were at that age, and I only wrote original ficiton. (Primarily because I had limited internet access and didn&#39;t know that fanfiction was a thing...)<br><br>At least the poetry rhymed - mine sucked, much worse than that, consistently until I was about nineteen.<br><br>Analgesia? *Snickers.* Well, could be worse. You should see what I named characters, way back when... and I totally second the never name them after birds thing. That was on beyond stupid.<br><br>I had much worse OC&#39;s when I was in fifth and sixth grade - so much worse, in fact, that I got more than 190 points on the litmus test. (That&#39;s almost twice as many as Twilight [when my friends and I went through that we took some of the vampire ~symbolism~ to it&#39;s logical conclusion, though,] and more than three times as many as anything else I&#39;ve tested, mine or anyone else&#39;s. 0.o )</p>

            <p>Also I think most of the hilarity comes from how I couldn&#39;t stick to one plotline and thus jumped around plotlines like woah. The end result kinda looks like Gollum on psychedelic drugs.<br><br>Also, the comments about the Charlie Bone/LotR/HP sequel are absolutely true. That was basically the plotline of the sequel, if I had actually ever gotten around to it.</p>
