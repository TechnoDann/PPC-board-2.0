            <p>What exactly do they teach you lot across the pond in regards to dialogue punctuation? I have seen a lot of Sues written by UK fanbrats who like to drop their punctuation in dialogue when it&#39;s not a question or exclamation. <br><br>I also asked on tumblr, and someone said it was because in those cases punctuation is not necessary because it isn&#39;t a question or a surprise. And yet this trend isn&#39;t widespread amongst UK writers since I know hS for one uses dialogue punctuation. So yeah, I&#39;m curious about what is the generally taught rules of punctuation in the UK.</p>

            <p>There are many reasons that modern languages have punctuation.  Latin is the only language I know of to lack spacing and punctuation, and that&#39;s because the words tell you which other words they modify. Also, Latin is hard to read when all the words are run together. <br><br>This probably wasn&#39;t helpful at all, but I tried. </p>

            <p>...it&#39;s a good theory.<br><br>However, there is one problem with this theory. Latin has some SERIOUS grammar, probably more so than any other language I have ever encountered. It is in fact, as a result, also the most specific language (grammatically) I have run into.<br><br>There is no way the average Mary Sue could cope with that aspect of it.

            <p>... as the title of the mission indicates, the fic in question is called Rambling Band, and I&#39;m going to lay odds that it vanished from the internet a loooong time ago. A quick search for one of the quoted lines reveals only four hits, all of which are the mission... although I did learn the surprising fact that Acacia posted the first 20 missions to Henneth Annun (which incidentally gives the earliest date I&#39;ve seen in connection with the PPC, specifically the <a href="http://www.henneth-annun.net/stories/chapter.cfm?stid=182">15th July 2002</a>).<br><br>However, if you&#39;re interested, I know <i>Chosen</i>, the subject of the <i>second</i> TOS mission, was also MSTed by Al&#39;s Waiter, <a href="http://www.alswaiter.net/LOTR/Msts/chosenmst1.htm">here</a>.

            <p>To be frank, I&#39;m gonna have trouble reading this one without more of them. Everything is very smooshed together, and since my vision options at the moment are &quot;no glasses and terrible eyesight&quot; or &quot;old glasses and lots of scratches and smudges,&quot; it&#39;s a hard prospect. ^_^;<br><br>Your options are:<br><br>1. Double line-break for each new paragraph (preferred online)<br><br>OR<br><br>2. Indenting the first line of each new paragraph (typical for print).<br><br>Right now you have no indents and only single line-breaks for most paragraphs, with the odd double line-break thrown in with no pattern I can discern, except the ones around badfic quotes. This is hard to read.<br><br>Also, every time someone new has an action, they get a new paragraph. I recently learned this goes for <i>all</i> actions, not just speech. You&#39;re kinda forced to pay more attention to which things happen in what order this way, leading to a clearer visual for the reader, and there&#39;s less confusion for readers trying to sort out what name belongs to what action/speech. It&#39;s hard to get used to doing if you aren&#39;t, but I&#39;ve been working on it, and I think it&#39;s really made a positive difference for me. I recommend it.<br><br>I do look forward to the planet-shattering kabooms eventually, though. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since you and hS seem to have hashed it all out very nicely. I&#39;d be in favor of the &#39;different people have different styles&#39; approach. Sometimes, individual actions really need their own paragraph; sometimes, they really don&#39;t. <br><br>Not to give badfic writers or PPCers or anyone really a terrible, terrible excuse, but some of the most distinct, quality writing seems to happen when people consciously break the rules for the sake of the story, and the style.</p>

            <p>&quot;Hi,&quot; said Bob.<br><br>&quot;Hi there,&quot; Joe said back.<br><br>&quot;Nice day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yup.&quot;<br><br>I think we&#39;d agree that those four lines deserve four paragraphs. Why not yours (which are already a lot more interesting than mine)? Not because the paragraphs wouldn&#39;t be long enough...?<br><br>Here&#39;s the thing that first put me on to this: <a href="http://ookamikasumi.deviantart.com/art/The-Secret-to-Paragraphing-152484151"><a href="http://ookamikasumi.deviantart.com/art/The-Secret-to-Paragraphing-152484151">http://ookamikasumi.deviantart.com/art/The-Secret-to-Paragraphing-152484151</a></a><br><br>There&#39;s a bit in there about not fearing the white space.<br><br>That said, the writer is coming at it from the perspective of what&#39;s expected in published, printed works, where shorter lines don&#39;t seem quite so small as they do on a big browser page. I figure what&#39;s good for published authors is good for me, since I want to be one eventually, but if that&#39;s not you, or if you don&#39;t think this would improve your storytelling, then I&#39;m not gonna force it down anyone&#39;s throat.<br><br>It <i>has</i> improved mine, though, I think. I have a bad habit of writing things out of order, possibly trying to be funny or clever, or something, but it&#39;s often resulted in really murky progressions that even I can&#39;t interpret long enough after the fact. Putting this into practice, along with advice about keeping things in strict chronological order as they happen/are noticed, is helping me de-murkify my writing.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... with the logic in that thing you linked to. It appears to run:<br><br>Each change of speaker gets a new paragraph &gt; A person is capable of being a speaker &gt; Every new person acting is a change of speaker &gt; Paragraphs should come out of my ears.<br><br>The flaw is between the second and third statements. Just because a person /can be/ a speaker doesn&#39;t mean they /always are/. For that matter, it doesn&#39;t take inanimate objects into account (Jacob whistled. The ball dropped. Jacob whistled a second time).<br><br>And... okay, I agree that narrative should be better used, but saying &quot;You have not split your paragraphs according to my rule; to do this, you need to entirely rewrite your story and use six times the words!&quot; goes beyond paragraphing. The author doesn&#39;t appear to accept the idea that not everyone has the same style - nor should they! - and that how condensed or expanded events are is a part of this.<br><br>... as to your original question: not because they&#39;re not long enough, but because they&#39;re a) incredibly boring, and b) causally related. A line break is an opportunity to recapture the speaker&#39;s attention. Doing so just to tell them the next event in a perfectly ordinary sequence is pointless.<br><br>And no, that isn&#39;t an excuse to begin every paragraph with a silent &quot;Suddenly---!&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I feel like you&#39;re arguing in favor of fewer, really huge paragraphs, and you probably aren&#39;t. Hm.<br><br>Anyway, the logic as I understood it was more like:<br><br>Each change of speaker gets a new paragraph &gt; Nonverbal speech (i.e. body language, gestures, throwing a punch, otherwise acting) is still speech &gt; Each change of actor gets a new paragraph &gt; Use as many as you need to tell a good story and no more.<br><br>The author does come off pretty confrontational in the article, but this is the disclaimer she includes in all her artist&#39;s notes:<br><br><i>DISCLAIMER: As with all advice, take what you can use and throw out the rest. As a multi-published author, I have been taught some fairly rigid rules on what is publishable and what is not. If my rather straight-laced (and occasionally snotty,) advice does not suit your creative style, by all means, IGNORE IT.</i><br><br>So there&#39;s that.<br><br>Really, it didn&#39;t make sense to me at first either, but it stuck with me, so I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be really helpful to me. For that reason, I&#39;m recommending other people give it a try, that&#39;s all.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First - yes to your PS. You have a sensible reason for grouping things the way you do, so that&#39;s fine by me.<br><br>Second - just to be persnickety, your first example would actually run like this:<br><br><i>&quot;No you&#39;re-&quot; Phoebe bit down on the instinctive denial. &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked instead. &quot;Who hit me?

            <p>Okay, I was worse. I thought that line breaks belonged between scene changes. And nothing else.<br><br>Also, I agree on the difference.

            <p>... which is the default effect of the &lt;p&gt; element—there is the option of using single line-breaks between paragraphs and indenting the first line. But you gotta do <i>something</i>, double breaks or indents. Exactly when to paragraph is debatable, but the fact that you have to somehow set off new paragraphs isn&#39;t.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Haven&#39;t had a chance to start my missions in this project, but I was giving some thought to the minis.  It didn&#39;t seem right to use something that only appeared in the Disney version, since the Mulan legend has existed for centuries before Walt ever started his studio.  Huns are really the only thing that&#39;s consistent between the original tale and all subsequent adaptations, so . . . yeah.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783500/1/Angelic-Layer-Neogen"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783500/1/Angelic-Layer-Neogen">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783500/1/Angelic-Layer-Neogen</a></a><br><br>Revolutionary changes have been made to the layer, and of course enthusiasts have flocked to them like moths to a light. But not all is as it seems to some. And to some others, all they know, about themselves, and others.. may be a lie. R&amp;R. LongHiatus.<br><br><br>This thing... ugh, this thing. There are quite a few canonical breaks here.<br><br>One: There are a bunch of new rules--for one, there&#39;s far more &#39;magical&#39; abilities and weapons, which are completely contradictory. For those who don&#39;t know the canon, the Angelic Layer game was originally a way to develop prosthetics--one of the creators couldn&#39;t use her legs, and the dolls were originaly designed to prototype and test a way to control artificial limbs with your mind. Unfortunately, funding was cut off, but the inventors decided to market the dolls as a game--that way, they could get data from the people who piloted their dolls, getting a much larger test base, and get more funding.<br><br>Weapons break this logic. Before, Angelic Layer was fought almost entirely with &#39;martial arts&#39;, or with players exploiting glitches in the programming. With the physical combat, the researchers get more data on specific movements, but with a weapon like a cannon--that doesn&#39;t help. ANd special abilites don&#39;t help either. It makes no sense.<br><br>Point two: There&#39;s a character who, at seven, had her parents killed in front of her. She ran into the woods, and found an abandoned shrine. THis makes a bit of sense--a seven year old is probably not thinking straight. However, she quickly finds a ton of gold in the abandoned shrine, and the next day goes into town, and buys a bunch of volunteers to repair the shrine with the gold. At seven.<br><br>No one questions the fact that there&#39;s a little girl whose parents were just killed, with a ton of gold, asking to repair the shrine (probably doing more harm than good to a priceless historical treasure) and she just stays there for /years./ Child services? What&#39;s that?<br><br>Third thing: THe hospital system is terrible. One of the OCs gets the living daylights beaten out of her by the shrine girl (who apparently became the sole master existing of some martial art) and needs to go to the hospital. Apparently the injured OC had to get a personality chip implanted in her /brain/ afterwards. This does not fit in at ALL with the canon, and afterwards she just leaves the hospital. She even seems to have gotten a concussion, and we never see anyone running tests on her, but she feels fine so she can leave. No parents pick her up or anything, the hospital just gets her a cab to a hotel.<br><br>Point Four: Sentience. The dolls in Angelic Layer have no sentience--the characters sometimes treat them as such, but they don&#39;t. In this, the injured girl&#39;s Angel (that&#39;s what they call the dolls) gets a personality chip that gives her free will. And apparently this is something that happens. A lot. THis lets the doll move, and speak, and think, but there&#39;s no thought given to the larger philosophical ramifications. THey can give toys sentience in a chip, humanity in a bit of silicon. Toys that children use to fight each other. Here&#39;s a quote from the story.<br><br>Keishin chuckled a little, &quot;Aren&#39;t we one to hold a grudge.&quot; By now he had adjusted to the whole free will thing.<br><br>No. How does this work? THe Angels now have free will, they can move about without being on a Layer. But players can still control them--how? Isn&#39;t that controlling a sentient being? What if Angels don&#39;t want to fight? Are there Angel activist groups? Can Angels vote? THe story NEVER goes into the huge problem of giving dolls designed to fight and be test subjects free will--are Angels without the chip considered oppressed? Is the desire to fight or personality traits programmed in? Do they truly HAVE free will? How does the economy react to suddenly having basically-immortal robots introduced? All these questions and more... are never answered.<br><br></p>

            <p>[Please note, actual levels of pleasure experienced may vary]<br><br>While searching for any remaining links to the badfics used for the Original Series, I came across a whole range of LotR badfic. The following are some of the ones that I feel DoI would flag up for special attention. <br><br>1)  <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3307759/1/The-Tale-of-Vearanniel"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3307759/1/The-Tale-of-Vearanniel">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3307759/1/The-Tale-of-Vearanniel</a></a> (rated T)<br><br>A Sue, possibly even <i>the</i> Sue. Her intro reads like someone looked up a Litmus Test, and then set out to fail it as quickly as possible. To summarise, her name is Vearnniel, and she’s from America, but ends up in Middle Earth after being trans-dimensionally snatched by ‘Gandalff’ so that she can fulfil her part in a prophecy. She has ‘gold hair that falls in a wondrous water fall down to her slim waist’, colour-changing eyes, as well as perfectly tanned and ’beutious’ skin. Both her parents died in plane crashes (one on Christmas, one on her birthday), so she has to live with her <s>wicked stepmother</s> evil stepaunt. She’s the smartest girl in her class, which means she has no friends and is picked on constantly. <br><br>Most of that is from the first three paragraphs, and trust me, it gets a lot worse from there.<br><br>2) <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432818/1/Emerald-Istar"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432818/1/Emerald-Istar">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432818/1/Emerald-Istar</a></a> (rated K+)<br><br>This is a re-write of ‘Ring Child’. <br><br>Yup, despite the best efforts of Ilraen, Supernumerary, Suicide and Diocletian (in a mission I very much enjoyed) Archir the Emerald is back! Archir’s character seems essentially unchanged, although he is slightly older (by which I mean a year or two), and his initial interactions with Gandalf seem slightly creepier to me. <br><br>3) <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/538447/1/Once-Upon-A-Time"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/538447/1/Once-Upon-A-Time">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/538447/1/Once-Upon-A-Time</a></a> (rated T)<br><br>This is a sequel to ‘All Souls Night’, otherwise known as Mission 13 from the Original Series. In this, Boromir is still alive and well, having married the Sue from All Souls, and has a sueish daughter. Cue a kidnapping and an excuse for the Fellowship to get back together again. <br><br>Featuring a couple of Sues, severely OOC Boromir (sadly, due to the timeline, <i>breathing</i> is out of character behaviour for him), varying levels of illogic, and general nonsense. <br><br>4) <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8512318/1/A-Dark-and-Terrible-Beauty"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8512318/1/A-Dark-and-Terrible-Beauty">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8512318/1/A-Dark-and-Terrible-Beauty</a></a> (rated T)<br><br>Did you know that Gandalf had arranged for another... I&#39;m gonna misuse the word ‘person’ here... to follow the Fellowship in secret, to keep them safe and help them out when they were in the most dire need? This is the previously untold (for good reason) story of that character. <br><br>Oh yeah, and she’s a shape-changing dragon. <br><br>We might need to get Spec Ops or ESAS in on this. <br></p>

            <p>I usually allow a small margin of error within CLAMP universe fanfiction, as CLAMP does a very good job at wrapping things up and fanfiction authors feel the need to create a new story-line. This story, however, is not okay.  Creating an AU that makes sense, or following a logical progression of events is fine. Throwing together things that do not make sense is not. <br>    Most of the problems have already been covered by firemagic. The only gaping wound in the story I haven&#39;t seen addressed is the fact that Chobits, another of CLAMP&#39;s works, takes place in this universe many years later. Most of this would render that entire work null.  </p>

            <p>In chapter 12, the Stu sees that his friend is acting weirdly, and thinks that there might be a malfunction. So, being a sane person, he calls up the doctors and lets them know his worries. They don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to worry about, but they take the girl in anyways and give her a check-up. Since the Stu did the responsible thing and called the doctors, they were able to catch a problem in the programming and help the girl, who undergoes much more extensive therapy so that she can know the limits of her treatment.<br><br><br><br><br>Naah, just kidding. That&#39;d be what&#39;d happen in a sane world. Instead, the Stu THINKS there&#39;s something wrong, so he decides to hack into his friend&#39;s brain and screw around with her personality, because it&#39;s not like you&#39;d need to be a doctor or anything to mess around with the thing keeping your friend alive. And of <i> course </i> he can&#39;t get consent from her friend, because she has no idea that she&#39;s relying on a personality chip to stay alive, because the trauma of getting some silicon in your head would put her in more danger than her not knowing she needs to stay away from putting magnets in her head or that someone with an internet connection could rewrite her brain. Obviously.<br><br><br><br>Oh, and some author notes:<br>Yeah, if anyone thinks that Teramora knocked this person out way too fast.. According to the mechanics I&#39;ve figured from the upgrades he&#39;s received between chapters, he does around 100 HP per hit. As for the incantations, they activate a pre-programmed series of actions in the scenario, making it less strenuous for Keishin to manipulate them. Plus, they&#39;re more &#39;dramatic&#39; lol.<br><br>Because those upgrades got the time and description necessary for us to figure out that they&#39;re not just some power-ups that make an Angel OP for enough money. Oh wait.<br><br>And Keishin-Stu essentially reprograms a portable layer--one that is a white table, essentially, with no terrain features--into a fully-customized city with NPCs, and allows people without Angels to make detailed avatars, essentially redesigning a complex piece of holographic technology to follow a variety of new rules that he seems to make up on the spot... in one night. </p>

The clone&#39;s hands turned into blades and she impaled both the angel&#39;s head, and heart, pinning her asU the blades spiked off within the angel&#39;s body like the limbs of a tree.

            <p>. . . I almost had to read every line you quoted from the badfic in a duller-than-Ben-Stein voice, the wording was so stilted and expressionless.  Kudos to both of you for slogging through this.<br><br>I like how Kilroy&#39;s absence due to being in a certain other, currently unpublished mission is referenced in the beginning here.  Aside from tying things together with a clear timeline, it gives all the agents involved in both a greater feeling of autonomy, since we see them functioning with a greater cast of PPC characters than in most spinoffs.<br><br>There was one scene I couldn&#39;t quite formulate in my mind.  It&#39;s in the beginning, when Mike is shooting the targets on the wall while Tanya reads the mission report.  Mike then turns to speak to Tanya, and is looking over her shoulder while firing, and Tanya has to duck under the line of fire.  But . . . when I look over my shoulder while pretending to hold a gun, my arms don&#39;t wind up aiming anywhere remotely near where my head is facing.  It seems to me the only way for Mike to end up shooting near Tanya here is to have swiveled her entire upper torso around.<br><br>One other, minor detail: when Jeanne starts to attack the Alucard replacement, the narration briefly refers to her as Mike.  (Mike closed the remaining distance between . . . )  Since Jeanne seems not to identify as Mike in the scene immediately after, I thought this might be a mistake.</p>

            <p>Yeah, Kilroy&#39;s off in an &#39;incredibly grimdark canon&#39; *couch* MLP *cough*.  And I <i>like</i> writing Missions with other people more than just on my own, so my Agents are going to have a lot more interaction with other agents/agent pairs than usual.<br><br>The gun scene could&#39;ve been better written, I admit.  I guess I didn&#39;t make it clear - when Mike turned to Tanya, whe wasn&#39;t able to compensate for the recoil anymore.  The bullets started missing the target and hitting the walls, then ricocheting off the wall and back toward Mike and Tanya.<br><br>And yeah, that should be &quot;Jeanne.&quot;  Nice catch.</p>

            <p>What about sommat like, &quot;she nodded once, sharply&quot;? Or, &quot;she gave one sharp nod&quot;?<br><br>I liked the flaming death of flameyness - although after all that worrying and talk of &quot;if we die,&quot; it felt just a teensy bit anticlimactic. But, watching Jeanne d&#39;Arc take care of business made up for it a bit (totally not because I am biased in favor of Joan. At all.) Also, I am madly jealous that Tanya got to talk to Jeanne d&#39;Arc and I didn&#39;t. Poo.<br><br>I rather enjoyed the flirting those two kept engaging in. It made me giggle. Although I have to wonder what Tanya did with those pens just before they went off to kill the Alucard!Sue. Did she write a goodbye note or sommat? Was that ever revealed and I just missed it because I was &quot;Night of the Living Internetless&quot; and forced to use my phone?</p>

My phone still accesses all of my usual sites, but using my phone to connect is 1) a giant pain and 2) saps the charge on my phone within an hour or two. I&#39;ll probably try to publish Rainbow Factory tonight or tomorrow on Google Docs, but I have no idea how patient I&#39;ll be with making the necessary post here and links on the Wiki.

            <p>Anebrin&#39;s probably concussed or in some sort of shock. Also, he probably shouldn&#39;t be walking if he&#39;s running into walls after being hit on the head, but since when have the flowers been great on employee safety?<br><br>(Also, technical note: are Fighter, Ranger and the like supposed to be titles? I figured they were, due to the setting and the consistency with which you did it, but if they aren&#39;t then they need to not have capitals at the beginning.)<br><br>After that, Des&#39; trick of &quot;I&#39;ve analyzed your fandom,&quot; actually reads okay, for Des being in shock/concussed. It does make some sense for ppc agents that come from world one to guess fandoms that they&#39;re very familiar with, and it&#39;s not especially Sherlock-style specific. Anebrin not having a lot of reaction to what is essentially a non-personal deduction is okay, because, let&#39;s face it, Sherlock gets cussed out because he blurts out things that are private in front of all of Scotland Yard. What <i>I</i> have slight trouble with is that Anebrin might be surprised that someone knows what type of elf he is, even if there are multiple types in his home world: either they are easy to tell apart (as they probably are in a videogame) or they are very hard to tell apart, and so far his only experience is within his own world. He does not know where he is, that there might be elves from other worlds in HQ, or even what has happened to him. If it is easy, in his setting, to tell elves apart based on dress and hair color, he shouldn&#39;t be as shocked by Des&#39; deduction as he is. (Compare: Hey, I see you have red hair and green eyes, are you Irish? Yeah, I know it&#39;s stereotypical, but if it works in the setting he&#39;d be used to it.)<br><br>If Anebrin is going to get riled up, I&#39;d think that knowing where he came from would be the thing to bother him, unless the elf group is some sort of secret in the game. Plus, the getting riled up just doesn&#39;t seem to jive right with how stunned he was a moment before. He needs to transition from stunned to wigging out over things being crazy, or something. <br><br><i>However</i>, the battle scene read a lot better than the last time. </p>

            <p>Yes, Fighter, Ranger and the like are (unit) names and are supposed to be capitalised. I followed Anebrin&#39;s home continuum, which capitalises unit names (Elvish Fighter, Troll Shaman, Wolf Rider, etc) but not race names (elves, orcs, trolls, goblins, etc).<br><br>Anebrin is the concussed one -- you mixed them up. And Anebrin is surprised because, let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s like an alien landing in your front lawn and saying &#39;hello there, human from Anytown, America&#39;.<br>Regarding the surprise: duly noted.<br><br>Last but not least, the fighting scene is better because it&#39;s basically jump-cut away.

            <p>Right, let&#39;s do this. Analysis, ho!<br><br><u>The Profiles</u><br><br><b>Anebrin</b>: Well, I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;ve characterised Irdiyan elves correctly... :P. Actually this is quite interesting, because while &#39;falls through a plothole into HQ&#39; is a common origin story, it&#39;s almost exclusively for World One agents. And, going on to the story, it&#39;s very rare that the actual fall-through gets <i>written</i>. No problems here, provided he does develop personality beyond &#39;Is Basically Haldir&#39;.<br><br><b>Desdendelle</b>: I love the idea of &#39;Oh, yeah, I&#39;m from basically World One, only they teach us axes in school&#39;. However, as with every gimmicky origin, it really needs to be used as something other than a gimmick. If you don&#39;t ever mention his homeworld again (do they have legal duels? Are wars constrained to ancient weapons?), it just becomes a way to accelerate his weapons training for free - a <i>deus ex machina</i>, basically. So that&#39;s a warning flag, but not a major one. I have no problems with the rest of his character, as he falls nicely into the Standard-PPC-Agent slot.<br><br>(Oh, and: argh, <i>more</i> Floaters? Seriously, is specialisation so hard?)<br><br><u>The Storywords</u><br><br>Wow, that&#39;s a lot of betas. Actually that almost worries me, since it means any problems may have been filtered out - but I suspect Vixenmage wouldn&#39;t let that happen for a Permission piece.<br><br>I&#39;m flagging a few somewhat &#39;off&#39; uses of linking words in your sample - for example, &#39;as well as that stony, burnt smell the more experienced Rangers and Avengers told the rest of the elves was that of troll shamanic magic&#39; feels a bit heavy on the &#39;that&#39;s, and &#39;If things would have gone as planned&#39; just sounds strange - but since those are the only two I found in the first page, and I&#39;m actually <i>looking</i> for them, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem. Again, the second sentence I just referenced is quite long - but I haven&#39;t tagged any others as being too long, so it&#39;s not a major concern.<br><br>As to the rest of the piece: I&#39;ve already mentioned that Anebrin&#39;s reactions are bothering me, and I&#39;ll expand on that. He comes across as confused and disoriented... but not disoriented <i>enough</i>. He seems coherent enough that he should be reacting more strongly to what&#39;s happening - particularly if (and I don&#39;t know if it is) teleportation is possible in his canon.<br><br>I&#39;m also somewhat concerned over how lax the Marquis is getting over recruiting proceedures. I&#39;m sure there used to be at least <i>some</i> paperwork... actually Dafydd tells me he had to wait two days for them to find a copy in a language he could read - and then another two days while he filled it out. But this is the PPC, we&#39;re a bit haphazard over that sort of thing, so no real problems there.<br><br>Overall, I&#39;m quite impressed. I went back and reread your last request thread, and the comments there were mostly that your writing was bland and unexpressive. I think you&#39;ve fixed that quite well (although, always room for improvement), so unless someone&#39;s spotted something I didn&#39;t...<br><br>Permission Granted.<br><br>Go wild. ;)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: The glasses-related comment in Anebrin&#39;s thoughts amused me, possibly because I&#39;ve <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndCorrection.htm">played around with the idea myself</a>. ~hS</p>

            <p>I was actually worried about being too much of a beta, initially, but that was on fixing the original permission piece - on this piece, I looked it over, I think, twice, so I was almost going &quot;Aaah! I haven&#39;t beta&#39;d it thoroughly at all!&quot; But it looks like the comments and discussions that were had over the original piece were taken to heart, because I only noticed one or two lapses on the look-over, and it looks like you approve, so...<br><br>Yay!

            <p>Woohoo!<br>-Dances around-<br>Uhum. Anyway... <br><br><b>Anebrin</b>: Oh, Anebrin will develop a personality. He&#39;d be boring to write otherwise. And most BfW!elves aren&#39;t like Haldir -- 90% are like Thranduil (with his less-than-stellar treatment of Thorin and co.), 5% or so are toned down versions of... Iunno, Galadriel (basically, the Druids/Shydes/Enchantresses/Sorceress/Sylphs which deal with the faerie), and 5% are like... whatever elf that behaves nicely to humans (not Legolas).<br><br><b>Agent!des</b>: I should and would mention his homeworld again. The best way seems to have him mention details casually in missions and tell a lot more in an interlude.<br><br>(Floaters: It&#39;s because I want to be able to spork multiple types of fics without having to invent more agents. Two are enough for me.)<br><br>&#39;That&#39;s: Probably because I&#39;m a native Hebrew speaker. I&#39;ll watch out for those.<br><br>Anebrin&#39;s reactions: Yes, TP is possible in BfW, though it&#39;s not very widespread -- IIRC, it&#39;s limited to Silver Magi, which are rare; the chances of him meeting one, or even witnessing one teleporting, are slim. I should take note of this.<br><br>Glasses: Well, I knew that there aren&#39;t any glasses around in the Aethenwood, so I thought, &#39;how would someone who had never seen glasses in his life describe them?&#39;.</p>

            <p>I understand that Des is supposed to be an author-avatar of you, but is he also supposed to be a Sherlock Holmes write/look/sound alike? I&#39;m getting this for a) your description of him having a &quot;Sherlock Holmes-esque coat&quot; (Not that that&#39;s bad, but the many different adaptations of Sherlock have featured different coats, so it&#39;s not really a sound description) and b) his immediate analysis of Anebrin. It&#39;s a bit far-fetched for him to get every single thing correct, especially because there are so many different types of elves and The Battle of Wesnoth is not a very well-known fandom (I&#39;m basing this off the 0 fanfics I&#39;ve found for it on ff.net). Anebrin also has very little reaction to this analysis, which is unusual as Sherlock Holmes gets cussed at a lot whenever he does it. You might want to look into that.</p>

            <p>While acknowledging that as Des&#39; beta, I have some bias towards his writing sample, I must raise an eyebrow at the idea that a character who wears a long coat and has analytical tendencies is assigned to a Sherlock Holmes X-alike, especially since his analysis of Anebrin amounted to &quot;You have all the physical characteristics of said elves, and I happen to know the fandom.&quot; There are plenty of analytical, even detective-esque archetypal characters who are still nothing like Sherlock Holmes. He&#39;s certainly the easily-identified example, but I don&#39;t think every character who shares his characteristics is in danger of being a clone.</p>

            <p>Without wearing any manner of Permission-related hat for now:<br><br>Anebrin comes across as, well, &#39;stunned&#39; is the only word I can come up with - the sort of effect often described in fiction as mild concussion.

            <p>Having finally written an introduction for my Agents ...<br><br>Both for Mary Sues, RC 612.<br><br>Coriander Beon<br>Male, elf, Lord of the Rings<br>He has short black hair due to the Sue from his origin fic cutting it against his will. He hates Urple prose, yet is forced to speak in it constantly. He also hates fire and noncanonical species. In his badfic of origin he was betrothed to Arwen in order to make Aragorn single, he asked to join the PPC rather than see Arwen everyday with another. It was understandably nauseatingly melodramatic.<br><br>Mare Elm<br>Female, witch, Harry Potter<br>She has plain brown hair and eyes due to having started life as a Generic. In her origin fic she was a Sue&#39;s best friend, there only to set up said Sue with Draco Malfoy. Mare&#39;s name results from a spelling mistake where her original name, Marlen, was misspelt Mareln. She has a fear of Professor Snape, is a Slytherin pureblood with all that entails, hates apples and Cute Animal Friends and won&#39;t stop matchmaking.<br><br>Writing Sample: (warning: unbeataed by any but myself.)<br><br>The newly christened Agent Mare Elm was skipping through the halls of the PPC. Luckily for her someone actually helpful had given her directions and a song sheet.<br>&quot;But still in matters vegetable, animal and mineral, I am the ver-gak!&quot; Picking herself up from the Generic Surface, she glared at the door that had decided to appear in her path. She peered round the doorframe at the corridor beyond, then checked the numbered plaque. RC 612.<br>&quot;I hope this &#39;partner&#39; I have to meet is single,&quot; she mused out loud, whilst searching for her wand. After a few minutes and a large number of empty pockets she found it tucked in her boot. &quot;Alohamora.&quot;<br>The door swung inwards and Mare stepped through purposfully and found herself in a brightly lit, cluttered room. A sword rested on Mare&#39;s neck.<br>&quot;State thy name and purpose mortal,&quot; a male voice ordered.<br>Mare grinned and ducked under the sword to face a strangly shadowy corner. &quot;Mare! Your sword&#39;s all stripy, like a zebra!&quot; she proclaimed. &quot;Coriander, I presume.&quot;<br>&quot; I go by Beon,&quot; the shadows replied. &quot;And I wish to know what you are doing in my Response Centre.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;m your new partner.&quot; Mare answed, then dragged Beon into the light. &quot;Hmmm, you look Middle-Earth Elven, but what&#39;s with the short hair? Oh, are you single? Have you been on many missions? Where do I sleep?&quot; she asked in one breath.<br>Beon took a few moments to try and figure out what had just been said to him, only for Mare to lose interest and begin poking random items.<br>&quot;Pardon?&quot; Beon finally managed.<br>Mare rolled her eyes, then asked, &quot;Who uses words like pardon and thy anyway?&quot;<br>&quot;My author either read too many novels of the romantic persuasion or owned a thesaurus. I ask that you stop poking my possessions.&quot;<br>The subsequent argument, that I assure you would have been memorable and incredibly funny, was alas cut short by a very familiar sound.<br>BEEEEEEEEEEEEP!</p>

<li>Mare&#39;s origin fic personality was decidedly bubbly and she is under the impression that the song sheet she was given is the only way to move through HQ.<br>In the rewrite I&#39;m doing, I&#39;ll try to make this clearer.<br>2. Beon isn&#39;t exactly condemmned to to speak in Urple, he&#39;s trying to learn from scratch. He didn&#39;t actually appear in person in his origin fic, but as Arwen&#39;s fiance he needed to be removed or Neuralyzed. I hope to show him learning to speak more normally over time and think it would be interesting to see how Mare&#39;s pureblood background affects this.</li>

            <p>I like it! Granted, the characters and the story could use a tad bit more fleshing out, but otherwise your characters are creative and original, especially Coriander&#39;s urple prose curse. The only thing that caused me any confusion was the fact that her name was misspelt as Mareln, and is now Mare Elm. Was the switch from an n to an m on purpose? By the way, Mare is quite a nice name; did you know it means sea in Italian?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know about &quot;short,&quot; but the &quot;things happening too fast&quot; is probably the reason it&#39;s so short.

            <p>So, since it&#39;s been a fair while since anyone posted anything <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=230604;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">down there</a>, and since my internet to-do-list looks like <a href="http://s66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/?action=view&amp;current=ToDoList.jpg">this</a> at the moment... time for the PPC Badfic Contest 2012 Closing Ceremonies!<br><br>I would, first and foremost, like to say a big thanks to two people:<br><br>-My wife Kaitlyn, for pointing out that I can actually just start a new website rather than trying to work old Fanfic Land into something easy-to-maintain. That bit of advice led directly to fanficWorld and XML-Javascript-powered goodness. Thanks, love.<br><br>-Phobos, for suggesting that now might be a good time to run the belated Badfic Contest 2012 (and for putting up with my somewhat whingy emails on the subject). It was a good suggestion - as the game showed!<br><br>The fact that these two suggestions came within 48 hours of each other, forcing me to put together ffW in under a week, is a demonstration of just what makes the PPC special.<br><br>Now, with that over...<br><br>I was JayBird, as ever, as well as the fanficWorld Admin; I&#39;m afraid I put rather more work into the latter than the former, which is why you didn&#39;t see too much of me.<br><br>My favourite moments, in no particular order...<br><br>-Finally finishing Jaycacia 4! Jaycacia has been dogging my steps since her creation (spawning? Ascent from the pit?) way back in... 2005, I think, although it&#39;s possible it was even &#39;04. <i>Sweat, Blood and Tears</i> has been hanging over my head for about half that time, and it&#39;s a relief to get her dead and not-at-all-buried at last. Not that she won&#39;t be back - a little thing like taking the Big Bang at a run won&#39;t keep our (?) Jaycacia down - but at least I might get a break from her next year.<br><br>-The appearence of 221bagel and a story that was actually entertaining to read (as opposed to the usual default, which is &#39;cringeworthily unreadable due to benig riten lIEK tihs!!1&#39;). For a little while I was tempted to suggest that we upgrade to &#39;PPC Badfic and Impossiblefic Contest&#39; and make the appearence of random AUs official, but decided against it. Far too restricting.<br><br>-Following the trail of flames left by TheGreatDestroyer, learning to hate said reviewer... and then finding myself cheering for him when he went up against Dystopian<em>Utopia. It reminds me (at least the principle) of the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=12a1TnYNeebzroINo1Ti9vILHC-jLNJZCtMBg">https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=12a1TnYNeebzroINo1Ti9vILHC-jLNJZCtMBg</a></em>64Busc&quot;&gt;Battle of Goldberg</a> - that brief moment when for once we felt common cause with the Suethors and Fangirls of the world. Well, sort of, at least.<br><br>So thank you, one and all, for a thoroughly entertaining game. The only prize is actually more of a penalty - you know get to look back on this autumn forever and think &#39;I wrote some really awful fanfiction then&#39;. And it&#39;s preserved for all posterity - hooray!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You mean to say these past Badfic Games have never seen something that was more entertaining than cringetainment? <br><br>Well then. /bows<br><br>Anyway, it was fun being the really annoying bad femslash and bad het writer who turns her own Agents into blatant caricatures, and equally fun to write in, like hS did with JayBird&#39;s stuff, those Agents&#39; reactions. Because I genuinely cannot sit down and write something terrible for long stretches of time. Eurgh.<br><br>And then it was even more fun to write the PPC Sherlock AU (OMG PUNS) even if it was in present tense which feels a bit disjointed from other missions! I&#39;d been wanting to try a new way of writing a mission - arriving in-fic after the Canon has been demolished, figuring out the canker like a detective mystery, and then setting things right. Only problem is then it&#39;s not as assassination as it is detective-work but hey. PPC Sherlock. <br>(I may or may not be running amok with the idea of Sherlock Holmes, <a href="http://consultingsueslayer.tumblr.com/">Consulting Sue Slayer</a> elsewhere on the internet. Oops.)<br><br>Also, this was the first game in which my own Agents got written about in someone else&#39;s story and I will admit, I giggled like a loon. Because GrimChick6x9&#39;s portrayal of Eledhwen and Christianne was hysterical (and fluffy, and her comments with ~AmythystQeen~ made me gigglesnort because I really like pulling LesYay with Ellie and Chrissy... oop).</p>

            <p>I am glad to be of service.<br><br>Anyway, it was another fun year for the PPC badfic game.  I was, of course, D4rkm0k (self-proclaimed M4573r 0f d4rkn355), Ponyrella96 (lover of ponies and Katy Perry), and Dystopian_Utopia (who is a dick).  I enjoyed most of what I wrote.  The jury is still out on DU.<br><br>Anyway, D4rkm0k needs to finish &quot;An Unexpected Dwarf&quot; and Ponyrella will continue writing the adventures of Sparkly Desu and the Department of Cute and Unique Friendships.  DU will also be back with &quot;Inner Strength&quot; (or as I call it, &quot;Ithalond Kills the PPC Universe&quot;) next year.<br><br>TheGreatDestroyer was a worth adversary.  I like that hS was cheering for TGD against DU.  I guess it&#39;s true what they say, &quot;Either die a villain or live long enough to see yourself become a hero.&quot;  Pretty sure that&#39;s how it goes.<br><br>Also, I love that Nume has somehow joined the ranks of Dafydd and Suicide as fangirl bait.  Lots of fun watching Nesh&#39;s reaction every time Nume got shipped.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>To get into the mindset, I tried to imagine a twelve year old girl who likes pink, kittens, and sparkles. She had probably watched Sailor Moon, and probably only read a mission or two. Then I made her the type to write and fill in the misspellings with whatever was the first suggestion, be it right or not.<br><br>There are defiantly different types of bad fic that have been explored. The raging &#39;Sue with good SPaG Jaycacia, The morbid squicky mess that Dystopian Utopia was responsible for,the very VERY bad slash of Lilith Wydenbrooke the unintelligible ramblings of TEH PSOICIC WALE (or however it may have been spelled), and the most common misspelled &#39;Sue which made up the rest of the fics. It was also interesting to see PPC goodfic, something that I would hope to explore further. Perhaps some crossovers?</p>

            <p>Obviously, I was FyreStarBlossom. This was one of the more fun ones, though I also wish I&#39;d thought to do more kinds of bad than blatant mispellings (though, that was more me not checking the way I spell things, since I type quick and make a couple errors most of the time.) I wonder, can I edit my two badfics up on the website? I might want to continue those, and see just how terrible I can make them. And how satisfying their deaths can be.<br><br></p>

            <p>As bad as my fanbrat fics used to be, I don&#39;t recall ever claiming to know any authors/artists in them. And I could actually spell rather decently.<br><br>xXlongxhairxshinyxthingsXx was like fanbrat, thirteen-year-old me on steroids, hence only two chapters.

            <p>Being relatively new here, this was the first Badfic Game I was present for. I was teh-psychic-whale, and I really wish I could have written more than I did. Then again, when you&#39;re writing a story about a psychic whale that sets universes on fire and has sex with ghosts, there&#39;s really not a whole lot to build on. That description is all you need.<br><br>But anyway, yeah, great ride.

            <p>I think we should really do an AU writing challenge sometimes.<br><br>A while ago, the Steampunk!PPC of... who was it?

            <p>I suggest using mostly supporting cast for the canon-pair-up. Put the Maria Hills, the Luna Lovegoods, the Tenzins in there--after all, we can account for most of the locations of the main characters most of the time, but who knows where they are when the protaganists are off defeating evil? Maybe they&#39;re making sure the stories stay on track. <br><br></p>

            <p>So, if you are a fan of both My Little Pony and Doctor Who, this post deserves your attention. The Doctor is Out is about the Twelth Doctor- a pony- who has been corrupted by Discord. The gray doctor is sociopathic, violent, womanizing, perpetually angry, cowardly, and does nothing to help the rest of the universe. Of course, this makes his occasional &quot;normal&quot; Doctor interactions with Miss Twilight Sparkle, the only pony he seems to genuinely care about, all the more heartwarming, especially when he goes back to how he is shown in backstory- much like the Tenth doctor. Of course, the story would end if he stayed good, and he reverts back to evil every time. It breaks your heart.<br><br><a href="http://askdiscordwhooves.tumblr.com/"><a href="http://askdiscordwhooves.tumblr.com/">http://askdiscordwhooves.tumblr.com/</a></a></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a fan of either, but I know both series casually. I stopped after a few pages of jerk-&gt;nice-&gt;jerk, mixed with fanart, fanservice and WTFery. I&#39;ve seen Ask-based comics that were genuinely funny and used the comments in a creative way, but this just became repetitive and kind of boring after a while.</p>

            <p>Like Lord of the Rings, you must be willing to plow through the boring beginning to get to the beauty of the story. Harry potter, too, the first 1/7 of the series I disliked, but it is now one of my favorite books. Much of the fanservice goes away, too, and I think you can toggle it off anyway.</p>

            <p>Also, a quote from the writer, the man who makes us feel all the feels:<br><br>Because I’ve hit 10k Followers, today at 4:00 pm EST I will be doing a livestream reveal of my identity. For some, this may not seem like a big deal, for others they might feel like it’s some kind of ridiculous publicity stunt, others are excited and curious, and still others are just there to see the reactions.<br><br>But for me, this is a very personal and important thing. I’m not being secretive because I’m shy, or because I thought it’d be funny to be that ‘mystery person’ on the internet like some people may assume. I’m not doing it for attention either. The thing is… for many, many years of my life, I hid my true self away because I was ashamed of myself and what I was, and I felt no one could accept or understand me. This continued for a long time, and for a while I even forgot who I really was and convinced myself I was ‘better’ that way. But I really wasn’t. It got to a point where I was actually contemplating suicide, but thankfully I got past that and realized I needed to stop lying.<br><br>I’ve made quite a name for myself as this ‘other me’, though. People assumed a lot of things about me, and hold a lot of expectations for me without knowing how I really feel.<br><br>So one day, I made Discord Whooves. A way to confront many of the darker sides of myself, my pains, my lies, my hatred for what I’d turned myself in to… So many things he says and does has some kind of meaning to my own experiences, metaphorically or literally at times. This blog has helped me confront so many of my problems and still continues to do so. I wish I could explain more, because I’m sure right now this all may seem confusing and over dramatic… But I know that once I reveal who I am, people will understand why.<br><br>This was also a way to start with a clean slate. I became a no-name artist, and created a mod-blog ‘Jitterbug Jive’ as a way to start fresh. No expectations, no assumptions, nothing in my past for people to throw in my face. Just me. Raw and simple, and free to be who I wanted without having to worry about ruining my ‘other’ reputation. I wanted to prove myself on my own without having that burden of my name holding me back. And I have never been happier. I have never felt more free to be myself. That’s why my pony’s special talent represents freedom, actually. I made him based on that free side of myself.<br><br>Thanks to everyone being so accepting of me, I’ve been able to gradually become more in touch with who I once was and want to be, and now I feel I can fully embrace this as my true self and cast off the lie I once was.<br><br>So thank you. All of you.<br><br>Now for my request: I don’t want to be treated any different after I’ve done this reveal. I’m Jitters. I’m Discord Whooves’ artist. Everything on Jitterbug Jive is the REAL me. I may have made some small white lies, but all of them had truth behind them.<br><br>Like I said, this will all sound very weird right now, but you’ll all understand once the reveal happens. You’ll know why I’m so uncomfortable with myself and why I’m honestly scared to face the truth of who I am, and why I’m scared to lose what I’ve gained after all of this. (No, it’s not because I’m some bad criminal or because I’m a huge celeb or anything ridiculous like that, but many of you MAY very well know who I am once the reveal is made)<br><br>So.<br><br>I’ll see you then. Thank you, again, for everything.<br><br></p>

            <p>Reading the mission, it was really well written. I&#39;d say more, but the people who have posted before me have put it in better words. I do believe the interactions between Caroline and Veralyn was one of the things that got my attention.

            <p>Finally! This has been a long time coming, and it&#39;s a great mission. Here are my thoughts on the mission, in no order.<br><br>One thing: I thought the disguise thingy automatically fixes it so that Agents can pick up things like walking or flying really quickly--one of my agents, Tera, was able to adjust to missing 3 of her eyes and a tail thanks to that.<br><br>Oh well, it&#39;s an entertaining sequence.<br><br>Interesting--I think another agent, I forget who, was supposed to die in their home fic. But since they didn&#39;t they had ridiculous bad luck all the time.<br><br>The Ritual of Activation of Ancient And Possibly Cantankerous Machine-Spirits was quite funny. <br><br>Hm... Honestly, I&#39;m not sure if the violent deaths of the Proctors, Caroline ripping off Replacement Dash&#39;s wings, and death by grinder violate the laws on torture.<br><br>Wait, Caroline was missing her cutie mark? I didn&#39;t know that.<br><br>All in all, this was a good mission. Nice job.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m still not sure quite how the disguise generator works, but either way that was one thing I knew I wanted to write: Caroline and Veralyn scrambling about like newborn foals. It was much fun.<br><br>The Activation of the...that whole thing was all Riese. I&#39;ve no idea if he made it up or got it from somewhere else, but I enjoyed it, too.<br><br>Hmm... the Replacement Dash&#39;s wing was torn off initially, but I thought I&#39;d changed that so that it was just dislocated instead? But maybe, if I did, that wasn&#39;t made clear in the description. And there were a lot of violent bits and only two - three, when Kilroy showed up - and Veralyn&#39;s stunt with the SO had deprived Caroline and Veralyn of weapons for this mission. And I doubt the mini-Discord caused the bits any pain when he inverted their wings - the real Discord took Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy&#39;s wings OFF and all they did was freak out about losing them. Still, maybe the bit judges could have been taken out a bit more neatly...<br><br>Yes, since none of the agents were described as having cutie marks, in my mind they never had any. :D<br><br>Glad you enjoyed the mission!</p>

            <p>No, seriously, it is.<br><br>There are so many things I love about this mission: Caroline&#39;s stand against Veralyn&#39;s attitude, rescuing Aurora Dawn and Orion, Kilroy and his 40k-related vocabulary, and the purging of the Factory. You&#39;ve even managed to integrate humour into this piece, a remarkable achievement for a fic so dark. <br><br>You&#39;ve even picked up on some charges Gaspard missed out on during his Intel run.

I spent the next three days alternating between running through the entirety of MLP: FiM (again) and killing things in World of Warcraft.<br><br>As a side note, my level 74 blood elf huntress gained four levels that week - totally not because I kept killing dungeon bosses I no longer needed to kill. At all. She is also mysteriously exalted with Silvermoon City - totally not because she was wearing the Silvermoon tabard during her dungeon runs.<br><br>Yes, the assassination was a bit more brutal than they usually are, although it was almost even worse - I think having Riese there to keep me sane during part two is the only thing that kept me from going into grimdark territory.<br><br>Hey, of course you can have Aurora - just so long as Caroline can pay her a visit now and then!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s always a good thing to have inter-spinoff interactions. Just one thing: I think Aurora Dawn had red in her mane. At the part where her wings give away, the crowd saw a &quot;<i>blur of yellow, green, and red</i>&quot; plummet to the ground. <br><br>Thanks again for letting me have her. Now I gotta start working on an introduction piece for Fire Flash and Taldaris... <br><br>By the way, what are you planning to do with Orion?</p>

            <p>Agent Caroline, that is, not...you know what I mean. XD<br><br>Nope - the author has a picture of Aurora as his/her icon on Fimfiction. No red in her mane that I can see - although her wings ARE bandaged in the icon and the story, so maybe that red was blood from her wings getting messed up? -shudders-<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll do with Orion yet; if ye have a good idea for him, you&#39;re welcome to have him, too.

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been thinking of getting permission soon, and I wanted to know if a non-PPC related original fiction story is acceptable as a permissions piece. The story has some similarities to the PPC, because it&#39;s meant to be a humorous conglomeration of pulp adventure and detective novel scenarios, and it&#39;s one of my more current pieces. <br><br><a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/s/3042108/1/Fiction-Savvy"><a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/s/3042108/1/Fiction-Savvy">http://www.fictionpress.com/s/3042108/1/Fiction-Savvy</a></a><br><br>(Concrit, incidentally, would be amazing. I posted it to fictionpress, but the response has been, shall we say, less than enthusiastic about telling me anything concrete.)<br><br>If original fiction isn&#39;t acceptable as a permissions piece, I&#39;ll just trundle along with my agents and write up something more PPC related. <br><br>My second question: does anyone know, offhand, if there is any special orientation or equipment or support groups for non-humanoid agents? (I have a velociraptor. He&#39;s bipedal, but that&#39;s where the similarity begins and ends.) Anything you can think of, such as modified uniforms or gadgets, or even a list of non-humanoid agents that you can think of off the top of your heads, would be helpful. I seem to remember a couple of equines, and of course there&#39;s Ilraen. </p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s handled agent-by-agent. For example! *pulls out list of non-human-agents*<br><br>Well, Agent Tera (sort of a bug-human thing) doesn&#39;t normally wear clothes. She does have a scarf that works just fine, and she keeps her patch on it. Agent Narav mostly wears a plain black robe (made of skin) and keeps his patch on a belt, because giant wolfman. Dr Kindheart is a unicorn, but she has a doctor&#39;s coat from MLP and an armband, and a pair of saddlebags that she stores her emergency kit in. She also has a set of specially-made light armor that fits over her chest, forelegs, and most of her barrel, because she got tired of getting bitten or scratched by monsters or whatever. Finally, Agent Riaa&#39;lzhor is a drider, so she has to get modified shirts and stuff (in her RC, she has a box of modified Snuggies, because they&#39;re actually practical for her) and a really modified saddlebag/belt-pouch thing.<br><br>I think that all of them would find special support groups hilarious. Tera might go along just to see what&#39;s up, Kindheart would go to make sure actual, correct psychology was being practiced, and Narav would go to see if he could find any new and interesting kinds of blood. If you decide to write the support group thing, then feel free to drop me a message--I&#39;d love to help with that.</p>

(No permissions giver should have to wade through that story when it&#39;s not finished... and I have just shy of 7 k words written and posted so far.) I suppose I&#39;ll scrounge up something else that I&#39;ve written recently, or I could just have them read the first chapter. </p>

            <p>To quote the wiki with regards to Permission pieces:  &quot;A link to a sample of your own writing. This does not need to be related to the PPC, but should be representative. We want to see whether you can write well, basically.&quot; <br><br>So far as I have been told, its actually preferable to write a non-PPC piece for Permission than it is to write, say, the beginning to a mission. <br><br><br>As to the other question, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m just as in the dark about that as you are. <br><br>Hope what I could find helps! </p>

            <p>Due to the considerable variety of agents in the PPC, it&#39;s implied that all personnel wear a non-uniform uniform. The only rules about clothing is that it has to be black and it has to have the departmental flash patch on it somewhere.<br><br>Support groups for non-human agents, eh? To my knowledge, none exist yet but you could do as TheMadHattress suggests and start one when you obtain Permission. </p>

            <p>According to the wiki, your permission piece does not have to be PPC related, so your PPC spirited piece should be fine. I am also planning to use a non-PPC piece, as soon as I get off my lazy bum and finish it. As for the second question, as far as I know no such group exists, so maybe you or your agent could start one. Maybe it could be a co-write, I don&#39;t know!<br>By the way, here&#39;s a link to the wiki article:<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission</a></a></p>

            <p><i>Well, here goes nothing. Presenting the first episode of my new series featuring the members of the Department of Intelligence. Google Doc is up on the DoI page on the Wiki.<br><br>Expect new episodes every two Valve weeks!<br><br>I’d like to thank Lily Winterwood, SingingTheThunder, firemagic, and TheMadHatteress for beta-reading this piece.</i><br><br><p> Episode 1 </p>
<br><br>It was unusually peaceful in the Department of Intelligence’s Action Division room. The massive cubicle maze that filled the entire stadium-sized room was quite quiet. The spies working in the myriad cubicles diligently filed their Intelligence Reports, geared up to enter Word Worlds, or manned their consoles in search of the next badfic to investigate all in relative silence. A sense of purposefulness and pride could be felt by those in the room: this was their job, and nobody could match their speed or their efficiency.<br><br>In short, it was a very productive trawl for Green Team.<br><br>And that was why, in some other dimension, the Ironic Overpower stirred. If it had hands and a mouth, this would be the part where it would rub its hands together and cackle.<br><br>Agent Bulldog, a tall African man in charge of newbie orientation, led a young and aloof-looking recruit down the narrow passages of the cubicle maze. Bulldog outlined the average day for an Action division agent, explaining several basic dos and don&#39;ts to the newbie. As the pair walked down Stupidity Lane on their way to Ponyville Plaza, Bulldog explained portal etiquette.<br><br>“Now remember Harris, while we do have access to a portal device that allows us to reach any point in time in space across the known multiverse, we do not use the portal generator on a whim. It’s for missions only, or access to New Caledonia if your shift overlaps the thirty-minute lunch break.”<br><br>Harris ran his fingers through his blonde hair. “I understand, mister Bulldog.” In his mind he added, That may be so, but I’m sure that a little peek at something I want to show Susie won’t hurt...<br><br>In its other dimension, the Ironic Overpower was (metaphorically) bent double, hooting with laughter.<br><br>An Arabic man poked his head out of cubicle 5294. Nasir Shafiq Beydoun watched the two men round the corner and leaned back into the cubicle. He sat back down on the storage chest and looked at the other person in the cubicle, Angus MacFarlane. “It’s just that Harris kid on his way to his cubicle. You know, the one who wouldn’t stop talking about Atlantis?”<br><br>Angus pulled a bottle of root beer from the mini-fridge he sat on. “Yeah, I saw him at lunch. Loopy fellow. He says he’s proved the existence of Atlantis and all that jazz. Doesn’t look like a bad guy, though. Say, when the shift is over we should go and say hello to him.”<br><br>Nasir went “Hmm.” and turned back to his work.<br><br>And so the day crept on without incident... at least until near the end of the shift. Angus and Nasir walked up and down the cubicle maze, asking around for where Harris worked. They found his cubicle all the way down Lothlуrien Boulevard, hidden behind a large filing cabinet placed in the middle of the lane. Angus worked his way around the cabinet and glanced inside the cubicle. Agent Harris had his back to him and was talking to a bored-looking woman sitting at a writing desk. She looked past Harris at the newcomers and mouthed “Help me.”<br><br>Angus glanced from her to agent Harris, who was still spouting more facts about Atlantis. Poor Susie must have been the unlucky person chosen to accompany Harris on his first week in the DoI. The tubby man cleared his throat. “Ahem. Sorry, is this the cubicle of agent Harris? Hey there, buddy! How’s it going? I’m Angus MacFarlane and this here is Nasir Beydoun. We’re also part of Green Team, so we just wanted to stop by and say hello.”<br><br>Harris stopped monologuing long enough to notice the two senior spies that had entered his cubicle. “Oh! Oh, I say, thank you for the welcome. I’m sorry if I’m repeating myself, but have I told you where the lost city of Atlantis can be found?”<br><br>Angus and Nasir shook their heads. Susie buried her face in her arms, probably hearing this story for the millionth time today.<br><br>Harris smoothed his hair again. “Oh, well, it’s just that I was recently recruited from a fic where I was just an exposition device to point a Mary Sue towards the sunken city. I managed to determine the location of the city through the careful study of maps and old legends. It’s really quite clever of me if I do say so myself, hoho. Thanks to my studies the Sue set off on her adventure that took her across the ocean and through North America to finally reach a harbour where...”<br><br>Sensing a very long story ahead of him, Nasir decided to cut to the chase. “Yes, yes, we understand. Did the Sue find Atlantis?”<br><br>“No, she somehow crossed a portal in the back of a cave that led to a place called Hobbiton.”<br><br>“Well, I didn’t expect that. Travelling to one imaginary place and ending up in another,” said Angus. “That’s actually kinda funny--umph!”<br><br>“That’s enough, thank you Angus,” said Nasir, elbowing his friend in the ribs and hoping that the comment would go unnoticed. Unfortunately, it didn’t.<br><br>Harris’ eyes narrowed. “Not a real place, you say? Are you sure about that, gentlemen? I have spent two entire years of my life in search of the sunken city, and I’d be damned if it’s not where I think it is, smack-dab in the centre of the body of water underneath the polar ice cap. Have you even heard the Inuit legends describing the city?”<br><br>“Well, no... But it’s just a myth in World One, it’s not real...” started Angus.<br><br>“I come from World One,” said Harris.<br><br>“Like the real World One or World One-and-three-quarters? ‘Cause it’s quite common in certain fanfics to cross World One with--”<br><br>“No, I come from the real World One,” said Harris, rapidly losing patience. “Look, I can prove the existence of Atlantis in under ten seconds. Wanna see?”<br><br>Angus chuckled. “Yeah. Go ahead, surprise me.”<br><br>Harris turned on his heels and started typing commands into the console’s portal generator. It took several seconds for the three other agents to realize exactly how deep in trouble they were.

Besides, portals here are one way only, right?

            <p>I see Harris is one of <i>those</i> coworkers.  I like his single-mindedness in focusing on the one particular Atlantis on his one particular Earth.  Hopefully, he&#39;ll get some vacation time (eventually) so he can visit one of the worlds with an actual Atlantis, and calm down in his obsession a bit (or get louder in it).<br><br>It occurred to me while reading this, would it perhaps be a smart idea to make a page on the wiki with Intel cubicle numbers, akin to the RC number page?  I know there&#39;s only a few used now, but if Intel becomes more popular in the future, it will be easier to keep track of what cubicles are already taken if we start now.</p>

            <p>I like this format—short and sweet with a good laugh at the end. You set it up beautifully and didn&#39;t rush to the end, taking time for character descriptions and setting the stage, which allows for building anticipation and curiosity and makes the final payoff all the better.

            <p>Thanks for the review! It&#39;s greatly appreciated.<br><br>Harris was intended to be That One Guy who was a massive disaster magnet. In fact, the prototype!Harris was supposed to be an ex-action agent who kept on getting himself nearly killed every mission or so*.

            <p>I&#39;ve always been quite fond of Intel (hence my semi-adoption of the Sub Rosa and Architeuthis - although, of course, since they aren&#39;t actually mine, you can use them if you need them), and it&#39;s fun to watch them at... whatever that thing is that isn&#39;t work. I think I&#39;ve heard of it... plae? Pliy? Something like that.<br><br>It&#39;s good to see Bulldog&#39;s definitely fully recovered from his House-Elf episode (and see him turning into an actual character!).<br><br>I&#39;m also intrigued by the fact that Harris can go from &#39;I was recruited from a fic&#39; to &#39;I&#39;m from the real World One&#39; in a few lines; I suppose it&#39;s the same as the difference between Middle-earth and a LotR-fic - they&#39;re the same world, but one is warped. It adds weight to my thus-far-unvoiced theory(/fact) that World One isn&#39;t actually <i>our</i> world... but enough of that.<br><br>Fun stuff. RiTe MoAr!!1. :P<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thank you! I&#39;m currently finishing up the second episode and sketching out a third, so there <i>will</i> be a lot more stuff down the road provided that Real Life events don&#39;t completely consume my free time. <br><br>Poor Bulldog has been in Limbo for, what, four-ish years now?
