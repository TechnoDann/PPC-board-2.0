            <p>Ok, let&#39;s take a deep breath and cross our fingers, shall we?<br><br>Here is my second post for Permission on the board. I put a good deal of time into this and have gotten pretty invested in it, so, while it is unlikely that it will be accepted, I really need some concrit to point me in the right direction if this is badly done. Well, what can I say but read carefully and don’t be afraid to post your most scathing replies; I learn best from such comments.<br><br>I request that they join the Department of Floaters, due to the fact that both the characters, who are both newbies, and myself, don’t know what their talents are for sporking.<br>The badfic I wish to start off with is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8235051/1/High_School_dose_it_ever_end"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8235051/1/High_School_dose_it_ever_end">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8235051/1/High_School_dose_it_ever_end</a></a><br><br>Agent Seanoic- A less stu-ish than average stu, he was found in a Fire Emblem badfic. He was recruited to the PPC because of  a sympathetic agent, who had also been a Stu in his own right. Male, relatively tall, with brown hair and sideburns, and is stronger than normal. He tends to not like fighting, as his above-par strength could give away the fact that he used to be a Stu, which is probably his greatest fear. Apart from mimes, of course. When he fights, he uses a bow.<br><br>Agent Reid- She is decidedly less sympathetic towards Sues and Stu’s than her new partner. She hails from World 1, but tends not to talk much about her past. She was asked why, and responded with a simple, “Who would care? My past is pretty much as normal as the next guy”. Female of normal height with black hair and average strength. She tends to use a sword in combat.</p>

            <p>Nice cliffhanger at the end!<br><br>I like how Saline got to use her background and personality. It&#39;s always exciting to see agents solve a mission in a way that other agents couldn&#39;t have used. I try to do so in my own missions.</p>

            <p>Oh, sweet Sharess.<br><br><br>One: Loki is a shapeshifter. He gets around fine in mortal clothes in Thor. Also, he is an illusion-er, so contacts and suchlike are unnecessary. Three: PEPPER POTTS. SHE EXISTS. Four: The only way she could be half frost giant and make it make any sort of sense is if she was Lokispawn, and that&#39;s assuming the canon version fathered Sleipnir and the rest of his children. Five: Why in the name of Madoka&#39;s Puella Magi Heaven was Loki moping in ASGARD?!?! <br><br>Sorry, I just... needed to do that. This was a great mission, and pretty funny. I do think you missed a few charges (Pepper and Loki being in Asgard) but it was still good. By the way, can I have Asguard? I kinda imagine that mini-Fury wearing widdle Viking armor.</p>

            <p>That thing about Pepper is supposed to mean that SHE is Tony&#39;s girlfriend, since--well, most of the movie canon. This Mabry chick is usurping her, and that&#39;s why the fact she wasn&#39;t mentioned ticks me off so much, not that she wasn&#39;t in Asgard.<br><br>Also, shouldn&#39;t Loki be in some kind of, you know, cell for all his attempted-genocide-and-mass-murder? At least he shouldn&#39;t be able to teleport, if he&#39;s not in a dungeon or anything.</p>

            <p>And I don&#39;t think he teleported himself. Otherwise he wouldn&#39;t end up in some random girl&#39;s kitchen... still, the fact that he <i>can</i> get out. Even if it&#39;s by the means of intervention from outside. Hell, in the fic it sounds like that&#39;s just, like, his room. And he&#39;s sulking in it like a teenager.<br><br>About Mabry, I chose not to really do anything about that since she&#39;s just mentioned once and it would have just been chunky to have to deal with that too. As said, I don&#39;t get the whole thing with ignoring Pepper. Maybe it has to do with another fic by the same author.</p>

The author gives us a really cool interpretation of the Pokйmon world here. I love all of these characters, especially the lead, and there&#39;s some great action here, too. If I have anything against it, it&#39;s that the ending is a tiny bit anticlimactic, but not by all that much. Highly recommended; I&#39;d even go so far as to say you&#39;d enjoy it even if you&#39;re not a Pokйmon fan.<br><br>Even better? It has a sequel (in progress) called <i>Life Beyond Listening</i> that should certainly be read as well. Have fun!<br><br>===<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4947386/1/The_Tale_of_a_Lupe_and_a_Faerie">The Tale of a Lupe and a Faerie</a> by RandomlyInsaneWhitePony<br>Fandom: Neopets<br>Rated: M<br><b>(WARNING: Chapters 10, 11, and 17 are NSFW)</b><br>Length: 26 chapters; 82,781 words<br>Summary: A scrawny and unusually large lupe escapes from the Neopian Pound and falls in love with the Soup Faerie. Will he win her heart? If he does, will society accept a relationship? Beware of teh fluffy cuteness!<br><br>So I&#39;m a bit embarrassed to share this one. If you can&#39;t tell by the author&#39;s note in the second chapter, this is adapted from a roleplay, and it shows a lot of the time in the quality and formatting. I warn you: the author isn&#39;t kidding about that &quot;beware teh fluffy cuteness&quot; bit, either. This probably won&#39;t be something everyone will enjoy, given the very lighthearted and silly tone and the NSFW parts, especially given the pairing. Also, the fic takes a dark turn around the 20th chapter that I found to be a bit frustrating, and the story ends on a bit of a downer when you stop and think about it like I did. I&#39;m honestly not certain if that&#39;s where the author(s) intended it to stop or if they just gave up; it&#39;s a bit vague.<br><br>Well, your mileage may vary here, but I definitely enjoyed myself with this. A part of me wants to see Blaze (the titular Lupe) to be recruited into the PPC, because he&#39;s just so much fun, but I can&#39;t make the call on that. Just sharing a thought. <sup>_<sup><br><br>===<br><br>&lt;a</sup></sup> href=&quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7864510/1/Pokemon_Journeys_Aarons_New_Experience%22%3EPokemon">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7864510/1/Pokemon_Journeys_Aarons_New_Experience&quot;&gt;Pokemon</a> Journeys: Aaron&#39;s New Experience</a><br>Fandom: Pokйmon<br>Rated: M<br><b>(NOTE: Current chapters are worksafe. If the author continues this work past Ch. 16, however, I cannot guarantee this)</b><br>Length: 16 chapters; 54,660 words<br>Summary: A heartbroken college student makes an amazing discovery. Pokemon become real and he quickly befriends a Zorua. What happens as they slowly become more than friends? Read and find out. Rated M for language, violence, and a M/F Human/Zoroark lemon.<br><br>Despite the summary, there&#39;s no lemon. Yet. See above note in bold.<br><br>This one&#39;s sort of like the Neopets fanfic above in that it&#39;s a case of &quot;Your Mileage May Vary,&quot; but in this case, I&#39;m not certain what to think of it, either. There&#39;s a lot going for it: the author does a decent job explaining how this world works and there&#39;s some genuinely funny moments, some good character development for the leads, and a lot of good action sequences.<br><br>On the down side, there&#39;s some moments that are just grating, like where the author goes on about pointless things (nothing controversial or insulting, just... pointless) to the point where I start skimming to the important bits. The revelation that this is based around a real life break-up with his ex is disconcerting, especially since the MC is an obvious self-insert. There&#39;s a really uncomfortable appearance from the ex-girlfriend&#39;s avatar, and it&#39;s easily the weakest point in the fic. The fact that the MC develops some Stu qualities doesn&#39;t help, either.<br><br>Even so, the ending (or where the fic currently stops at Chapter 16; the author has expressed a desire to continue the story, but hasn&#39;t updated in nearly two months now after updates had previously been added every few days) does lift my spirits quite a bit. The author is actually taking the relationship between these two characters very seriously, and never writes a sex scene in any of the current chapters despite what the summary warns, showing that he&#39;s not just in it for cheap erotica, which I can respect.<br><br>This is definitely one you&#39;ll have to figure out for yourselves. *shrug*<br><br>===<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6601875/1/Not_Strong_Enough">Not Strong Enough</a> by FalconMage<br>Fandom: Final Fantasy X<br>Rated: M<br><b>(WARNING: Fanfic is NSFW)</b><br>Length: Single chapter; 9,409 words<br>Summary: This is a one-shot story about Kimahri and an OC. Contains M/M stuff and all those crap. Read at your own risk. Oh, and I think this could be categorize as a furry story too. Isn&#39;t Kimahri considered as a furry..? Read it, if you like. Haters, welcome. :D<br><br>Ugh. Can you believe I read that summary and thought this wouldn&#39;t be that bad? Seriously. I figured this&#39;d just be some mindless slash that would be harmless and entertaining to read. I&#39;m kinda silly, huh?<br><br>Well, okay, it&#39;s not the slash itself that bothers me. Really, that part&#39;s pretty standard. It&#39;s how the author leads into and justifies it. There&#39;s an awful, AWFUL amount of continuity flubs that the author uses to justify the canonxOC slash pairing. And these aren&#39;t tiny things either. I won&#39;t give details in this post (there&#39;s some massive spoilers for the actual game, but I will say that if you&#39;ve ever played FFX (or are at least familiar enough with the plot), you&#39;ll notice the issues immediately. Kimahri is pretty OOC, as far as I can tell. Also, part of me is curious now at the plausibility of the Stu in this continuum, given his species and supposed relationship to Kimahri. I say kill it.<br><br>===<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7471170/1/Lucario_and_the_Mysterious_Magician_of_Paris">Lucario and the Mysterious Magician of Paris</a> by LuckyNekoNinjaMaiden<br>Fandom: Pokйmon<br>Rated: M<br><b>(WARNING: EXTREMELY NSFW)</b><br>Length: Single chapter; 18,237 words<br>Summary: A punk Lucario meets another Lucario in Paris, France who is a talented magician. But that Lucario is actually a Zoroark who wants to make him his new sex slave. Zoroark/Lucario/Lopunny. M/M/M . Rated M for many reasons. You&#39;ve been warned.<br><br><br>OW. Just... OW.  The vomit-inducing sappiness outside the NSFW bits are bad enough, but the sex scenes by themselves are uncomfortable (gee, go figure there, huh? But seriously, some of these just make my skin crawl). Father-son incest (admittedly adoptive son, but the author makes no effort to mask the incestuous overtones) that, while I&#39;m certain the son isn&#39;t actually underage, feels a LOT like pedophilia given how it&#39;s written.<br><br>And there are is just so. much. sex. between the three characters in this story that it gets annoying really quick and you start begging for it to end, and that&#39;s not even going into just how stupid the characters are. +1 to the &quot;Inconceivably quick development of Stockholm Syndrome&quot; count while we&#39;re at it. Sweet merciful Arceus, this was ridiculous! KILL IT NOW! Eugh, I need a drink... *grabs a soda and pretends to get drunk*<br><br>By the way, for those of you who are masochistic, this author has an entire gallery of fics that are all fair game for sporking as well. Or, at the least, every one I read seemed to be. Yeah, it&#39;s true, I enjoy inflicting pain on myself. *cringe*<br><br>===<br><br>Well, hate to end this on a sour note, but there you have it! Hopefully, I&#39;ll find more I can bring in the near future, and maybe have a larger percentage of actual goodfic next time. Oh, well! At the least, you can still spork it. :D</p>

            <p>Hollyleaf is not actually acting OOC (as compared to Warriors canon).<br>Instead, Hollyleaf is the one character, canon or otherwise, who is not affected by StraGlem&#39;s Mary Sue-ness. Obsessed with the warrior code as Hollyleaf is, she&#39;s outraged by the abomination against the code that is Satrglame - a cat who is not only the halfClan kit of a medicine cat (who is himself the halfClan kit of a medicine cat, and should know better) but also: has two cats from other Clans, one a leader, falling at her feet; kills needlessly without a second thought; becomes the leader without having trained an apprentice or even having been deputy, ever; and makes a cat who&#39;s also never had an apprentice her deputy. Confronted with the walking code violation, Hollyleaf has lost sight of her original purpose and is willing to do literally anything to destroy GleamStare, even an Enemy Mine with the Dark Forest (who are the only other cats resistant to SarGkaem&#39;s influence). This is even in character at least mostly for her: a Knight Templar willing to go to any length to &quot;protect&quot; the warrior code from its defilers.</p>

            <p>I think there may have been more spelling mistakes than correctly spelled words!<br><br>I don&#39;t really know the setting, but anything that gets compared to My Immortal makes me curious (and, oh, how I have regretted that on some occasions). <br><br>Sadly I had nothing stronger than orange juice to keep me going through reading it, so I quickly gave up on the fic itself, but carried on skimming through the author&#39;s notes, as I&#39;d found the earlier ones to be particularly amusing. My favourite line from one of these has to be &#39;<b>HBut thigs are guna be better no inteh clams!</b><br><br>Now, that one line taken out of context doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, but... well... it didn&#39;t really make a lot of sense <i>in</i> context either. <br><br>Funniest bit of the actual story for me (or at least, the funniest bit that I was able to bring myself to pay attention to) is the &#39;10&#39; commandments, of which there are in fact 11, with number 10 appearing twice, and 3 not getting a look in. <br><br>The similar numbering system used for the chapter numbers also amused/confused me in equal measures, are we meant to be reading it as presented or are we meant to read the chapters in numerical order?

            <p>Hoo boy is this dark. It&#39;s incredibly well-written, but... *shivers* The only NSFW details are what your imagination puts into the blanks, so... Fair warning.<br><br>It&#39;s called <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7864670/1/Mandragora">Mandragora</a>. It&#39;s set about the end-ish of Year Two, when the mandrake potions are being made to restore everyone who&#39;s been petrified. <br><br>It&#39;s rated T, close to 1500 words in length, and is a one-shot. And oh boy is it terrifying.  The author (NothingPretentious) has some other stuff that&#39;s also worth a read, and it is not <i>nearly</i> as dark, thank [insert deity here].<br><br>Just...sleep with a nightlight after reading Mandragora, okay? I&#39;m going to.</p>

But that all changed when an anomaly opened in there class room and Murtagh, hansom and ever, jumped out and pulled them back through to his home world, Alegasia. after book 3 in 2 POV&#39;s.<br><br>Where to start? First chapter they burn half their teacher&#39;s face off and laugh about it. Second chapter nothing happens. There are examples of bad SPaG. For example Lana doesn&#39;t put a capital letter at the beginning of sentences and Evie combines misspellings with faintly Urple prose.<br>My main problem with this is the species. There is a chapter where literally everyone (except Evie, who is Galabatorix&#39;s daughter) reveals they aren&#39;t human. This is started by Lana, who proclaims &quot;I AM A GODFORSAKEN ELF!&quot; Later on they meet up with yet more inserted friends, all of whom are also random species.<br>Now what really annoys me, is that Captain Hilary Becker (I&#39;m allowed Lust Objects, right?) is Superman. No explanation for all the times he&#39;s been hurt in canon, no reason given for why, just Becker is Superman.<br>A few quotes (please say if this isn&#39;t okay): &quot;It had been a full moon last night and would be again tomorrow.&quot; &quot;How are we going to shave her now!&quot; &quot;If you look up to the skies you might be able to see saphire in the is also a call for &#39;friends of evie&#39;&quot; &quot;I mean people don&#39;t just go blind without a cause do they?

It&#39;s uncanon even before it gets to the sour yellow fruit bit, as it starts with Mata Nui returning with the power source he needs for the prototype robot while it&#39;s only been <i>&quot;days&quot;</i> (and I quote) after the Battle of Roxtus. No, no no no, he didn&#39;t go up to the Valley of the Great Beings until approximately five <i>months</i> after that battle, so one down right there.<br><br>The prose is awkward and odd and painful to read, and that&#39;s before the dialogue, which is OOC and also painful. (Mata Nui uses a contraction [&quot;I&#39;m&quot;] in his first line of dialogue, for the love of the Great Beings!) The timeline is all messed to Karzahni, as Mata Nui is trying to convince Raanu to let him use the prototype robot (which the Glatorian and Agori are using as their home) to fight Makuta Teridax, when in canon Mata Nui convinced Raanu to let him do that <i>before</i> going on his quest to find the battery.<br><br>Gresh is written as a paranoid little pest, suggesting Mata Nui would use the abilities of his giant robot body for destructive purposes when he has <i>seen</i> Mata Nui be nothing but noble and selfless, and the words put in his mouth say Mata Nui thinks he is better than them when, again, <i>Gresh respects Mata Nui</i>. Ackar&#39;s pretty much in character when he admonishes Gresh, though, which is a small light in the shadows.<br><br>The dialogue is, again, painful. In addition, Mata Nui knows more things in more detail than it seems like he should, like the Great Beings&#39; original plan to have two giant robots for the reforming of Spherus Magna and that Makuta Teridax was in fact destined for one of them.<br><br>Then the sex scene. Not only is it not erotic in the slightest, the euphemisms it uses aren&#39;t even interesting (&quot;love&quot; for... well, everything from tingling in the &#39;nads to the &#39;nads themselves, as well as &quot;heat&quot; for erotic feelings), and the sex scene itself is <i>completely</i> uncanon because Mata Nui A, doesn&#39;t have the bits for it, and B, as a creation of the Great Beings along the lines of the inhabitants of his giant robot body AKA the Matoran Universe, <i>couldn&#39;t feel sexual attraction if he wanted to</i>. Greg Farshtey said so, no one has to like it but it is going against canon.<br><br>Also there was one line where the Mask of Life apparently has opinions on &#39;forbidden love&#39; and I don&#39;t even care anymore.<br><br>Then... -sigh- Then Teridax... notices that the two had sex... and there was a mention of potential nosebleeds... and words in his mouth more appropriate to the typical teenager than the suave scheming son of a Doom Viper that Teridax really is... and ugh okay it&#39;s terrible and there are tense shifts and a lack of scene breakers and Teridax was <i>freaking out</i> which is not the right wording if he&#39;s disturbed by something PLEASE to be retaining the dignity of an evil schemer with more plans than  months he&#39;s been alive and... and ugh. Also not much description anywhere, yay not.<br><br>I think the Mata Nui is a replacement, what with the whole <i>him having equipment appropriate for sexing</i> thing. Gresh is probably just possessed and Raanu is OOC a bit, I&#39;m not sure about Kiina but she&#39;s more OOC than Ackar (but then he&#39;s pretty much entirely IC so that&#39;s not hard). Teridax will need neuralyzing and <i>that</i> will be a fun little adventure for any agents going into this thing won&#39;t it. Anyone got a way to neuralyze a spirit possessing a 40 million foot tall robot?<br><br>Verdict: Somebody forcefeed me Bleeprin before I get my hands on a spork and cause injury to my eyes.</p>

            <p>As long as they&#39;re not a completely overblown Sue/Stu, I don&#39;t see an issue with it. Several written agents come from that background - among them Jill Greenleaf, Kelvin Talathion and Dafydd Illian. Just don&#39;t give your new agent ridiculous superpowers - or if their origins demand it, slap some strict limitations or disadvantages on them to balance things out. It&#39;s no fun if they can wander through the fic busting everything with a wave of their hand; they should still have to struggle/ get stressed/run into actual difficulty.</p>

            <p>I was intending to take your advice even before you gave it, but I didn&#39;t know if they came from real fics or not. If I need to find a Stu to make my character work, I might just have to scream. I have an idea for an agent that, admittedly, took a while to dream up, but the cost/benefit of having to sift through such great masses of badfic before I even have permissions to make it worthwhile is... daunting.</p>

            <p>I much prefer making the characters up myself. Others have different opinions, and certainly a lot of people have a lot of fun the other way, but I find I&#39;m most comfortable with characters made entirely from scratch.<br><br>And if their fictionalized backstory is a badfic, that&#39;s perfectly legal as well!

If there is anything that I need to do before that occurs, please inform me by replying to this message.<br><br>To those veteran members of this community, including the founders Jay and Arcacia (I hope I have those names right), I would like to offer you all my thanks. Thank you for what you have created here, both the universe you have created and the welcoming and fun community you have developed. Thank you for the support you guys have given myself and others who may have started out around the same time I have. I found myself enjoying the tales written by you, laughed at some of the antics your characters and those of other people&#39;s works pulled off alongside each other and I managed to gain some new insights into effectively analyzing and critiquing fanfiction work.<br><br>Now, I believe this ... is where I get off.<br><br>PPC Boarder &#39;CDHammer&#39;<br>C.D.

            <p>OK, I&#39;ve missed something.<br><br>I just came from a charming Livejournal currently (As of 2:25 AM, Ireland time) on the front page that talks about tensions on the Board. above it is a person thinking of leaving because of a bad Thread that I won&#39;t get into.<br><br>My reasoning for not being on the board is a little out of shame- after two failed Permission attempts, I felt a little like a laughing stock.

Im a very civil and opened minded person, but I will not be bullied.

            <p>People have been seriously hurt these past few days. In fact, we&#39;re seeing some brilliant people leave because of recent events. After Tray-Gnome, I&#39;ve seen Herr Wozzeck also declare his intention to quit and people like JulyFlame, Artell, Cassie, and Maslab are thinking of leaving. I haven&#39;t been around long enough to properly know them, but when oldbies are thinking of leaving, we seriously need to stop and take  a good long look at ourselves and what we&#39;re doing. <br><br>We&#39;ve made a mistake. Mistakes happen. We absolutely need to  learn from this, or else we forfeit any chance of improving this community.<br><br>In the light of recent events, I believe we need to amend our Constitution so that we can maintain a safe, fun, and respectful environment.<br><br>Looking down at the mess that has become Jacer&#39;s Permission thread, it is clear that there is confusion when it comes to the &quot;Don&#39;t say the other person&#39;s opinion is wrong&quot; rule. Having free speech is nice and all, but I firmly believe there is a line that we must not cross when saying/posting things. Some might argue that this is not true free speech, but I think this is a manifestation of common sense. <br><br>The opinion rule works when it&#39;s something small such as &quot;Person A doesn&#39;t like Person B&#39;s taste in fandoms&quot; but breaks down completely when it&#39;s &quot;Person A has a major problem with a facet of Person B&#39;s identity&quot;. <br>We need something bigger to deal with these types of situations. Remember the DoctorHello incident? He was rejected so hard his intro thread was purged from existence.  Why?<br><br>It&#39;s because we practiced Zero Tolerance. DoctorHello shocked the rest of the community with his sick joke and we came down hard on him. <br><br>I propose that we include a subsection to the first rule in our Constitution: that we will not tolerate any sort of discrimination, persecution, or diffusion of harmful opinions. A single offense is completely unacceptable and will be punished. If Zero Tolerance works with bullying in schools, why can&#39;t it work here? <br><br>As for second chances... I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t worked out that part yet. Zero Tolerance might seem harsh and extreme, but from my point of view it&#39;s the most effective way of staving off crises like this one.  <br><br>I don&#39;t want the PPC to break down and end. Not like this.</p>

            <p>Back in the early days of the PPC, we had enough collective common sense and inherent respect for each other that such a rule was completely unnecessary. It was not a hope for goodwill; it was an <i>expectation</i> of goodwill, and that expectation was met for almost ten years. That is why it is only being said now...because only now has it become necessary.<br><br>I don&#39;t think Jay would be offended, though I can&#39;t say as much for &quot;Arcadia&quot;...</p>

            <p>...includes being able to take criticism--especially of a spelling error--gracefully. Otherwise, the PPC runs the risk of being hypocritical for dishing out literary criticism but not being able to take it.<br><br>On that note, let me say that this does not seem to be the right place for you. You are trying very hard to get Permission, but are not able to find your way around the most basic thought processes of the PPC:<br><br>- You make an unnecessary post that bumps a topic off the first page, instead of scrolling down to read a topic yourself. You outright state that you know someone&#39;s discussion will get bumped off, but you post anyway.<br>- When asked to read the aforementioned topic, you ask for a link, instead of taking the initiative to find the link on your own (still on the main page, if I&#39;m not mistaken).<br>- When you find your way to the discussion of the &quot;PPC tension,&quot; the first thing you do is assume that for years, your fellow Boarders had been thoughtless and ignorant, instead of assuming that we are intelligent and respectful of our peers.<br>- You compound this by misspelling the names of one of the original PPC agents.<br>- When someone gives you a subtle hint about this misspelling, you don&#39;t catch the error, and you don’t try to figure out what was wrong by yourself. <br>- When that person abandons subtlety and shows the error to you bluntly, you resort to being snide.<br>- You give constructive criticism to a fanfic author in which you misspell the word &quot;grammar.&quot; You proceed to tell the author how much you respect him or her at the same time that you cry &quot;Spork the B****!&quot; on the Board.<br>- Instead of being fully prepared in your first post for Permission, you are ignorant of basic PPC procedure, such as getting a beta.<br>- Instead of accepting feedback with gratitude, you mask your defensiveness behind questions every time someone points out a mistake.<br>- This is all beside your apparent ignorance of what, exactly, constitutes other people&#39;s intellectual property.<br><br>To sum up: you cannot navigate your way around the PPC without your hand being held at every turn. And if someone does take your hand with the slightest bit of reluctance or exasperation, you retaliate by being rude and/or swearing. <br>This does not demonstrate goodwill or good faith in your fellow Boarders. It does not show that you possess the fandom etiquette and literary skill necessary to participate in a group geared toward fanfiction critique. Please be on your way; you are not a positive addition to our community.<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Diffusion of harmful opinions&quot; is a dangerously open-ended idea.

But there&#39;s a line between &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;my feelings are hurt.&quot; <br><br>Putting this kind of thing in the Constitution sets a dangerous precedent.

We&#39;re mature adults, for God&#39;s sake, and if people have a problem with each other then they can settle it like adults.<br><br>Yes, we may lose some members.

I don&#39;t want this to ever happen again.<br><br>In addition, possibly more controversially. Is there any way to set up a support system, like the Sibling thing, or <i>something</i>, where people should be able to say that someone is harassing and bullying them - and a way to give that person a clear &quot;Stop this and apologize, or leave&quot; choice? It worries me a lot that Jacer had been harassing people, members of the PPC <i>especially</i>, by e-mail or what have you, and that this was not out in the open until she asked for permission.<br><br>We&#39;ve always considered people PPCers as soon as they start to hang around the community, and I know that general policy is that there&#39;s no Official Distinction with permission, making some people More PPCery than others. So... that kind of behavior should be nipped in the bud for all PPCers, not just permissioned ones.<br><br>And I don&#39;t know if my past arguments and actions concerning authority, or whatever issues came up, have influenced that situation, but if that is the case, I do apologize. It just... shouldn&#39;t be happening. I know there&#39;s a &quot;Take personal issues to private forums&quot; amendment, but much like the amendment we&#39;re all looking at now, that shouldn&#39;t extend to harassment and bullying; this was a really bad case, but the problem should not get as bad as suicide before we&#39;re ready to do something about it.</p>

            <p>This seems like a reasonable Idea, and should help prevent this sort of thing from happening again. And I believe I speak for all of us when I say, this sucked.<br><br>However, one thought I had when was reading this was that if we extended the scope of this amendment to also cover starting threads on potentially controversial topics. If we banned threads like the one that started the first Jacer issue, this never would have started, and we would all be a lot happier.<br><br>I say this because many people feel strongly with regards to these issues, and starting massive one-sided discussions with regard to such while banning any other point of view might become just as wrong.  In any case, we should remember what we are really about: finding humor in badfic.  I believe that the amendment, with this change, will allow this board to remain the sanctuary that has been  spoken of so highly.<br></p>

            <p>I took a shot at revising and integrating article one. This isn&#39;t intended to be the final product, and all suggestions are more than welcome, but see what you think of it to start:<br><br>A: Discrimination and persecution of any kind will not be tolerated, especially on the basis of sexism, racism, ableism, nationalism, homophobia, transphobia, or religion. We will not tolerate individual people or groups who intentionally oppress, persecute, other, use or otherwise attack others in any way, shape or form, for any reason.<br><br>B: Do not flame. There is a distinct difference between &#39;I don&#39;t agree with your opinion and I think that your theory is factually wrong&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re an idiot and your opinion is built on lies and stupidity&#39;. If you find that you&#39;re hurling insults around, just stop. In addition, we don&#39;t tolerate anyone making jokes about topics like rape, murder, abuse, bigotry and mental health issues.<br><br>C: People engaged in any of the above will be given at least one actual chance to stop and apologise. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance. A chance is, for example, the following:<br><br>John: Mass Effect 3&#39;s ending was terrible and the Extended Cut just made it worse!<br>Jane: I don&#39;t know, I thought it was all right.<br>John: Only an idiot would think that! You&#39;re an imbecile!<br>James: John, we don&#39;t tolerate people who insult others here. Calm down, step away from the keyboard, go read the Constitution and then please apologise to Jane.<br>John: All right. I&#39;m sorry for insulting you, Jane. I don&#39;t agree with you, but I&#39;ll leave it at that.*<br><br>D: All respectful opinions that do not attack, insult, or persecute others (see A) are welcome. We encourage respectful, friendly debates here. Should a debate escalate into an argument for any reason, everyone involved should step back and calm down before continuing. If this cannot be done, it may be best to abandon the conversation entirely.<br><br>E: If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you’ll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant- it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts.<br><br>F: If you find it impossible to get along with another member of the PPC, please take it up in private e-mail. Don’t turn our spaces into free-for-all flamefests, don’t engage in bullying behaviour, and while you’re in our spaces, don’t say anything about another PPCer you wouldn’t say to their face. Remember, if you have to ask yourself if you’ve gone too far, you probably have. Everyone should do their best to be as civil as possible while on the Board.<br><br>G: The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If you see someone breaking any of the rules and guidelines herein, please ask them to stop (politely, though) and explain why. If this doesn&#39;t resolve the situation, you will be backed up - and if it continues, a persistant rule-breaker is likely to be shunned or asked to leave the Board. (If you&#39;re being accused of breaking a rule, take a step back and, if you are in the wrong, stop, apologise, and move on. Grudges are no fun!)<br><br>H: Everyone on the Board is to be respected, be they newbie, oldbie, Permission Giver, IRC mod, author of dozens of missions or writer of two missions. The opinions of a newbie are just as valid and wanted as those of someone here for four years. <br><br>I: The moderators and Permission Givers are here for a reason. Should one tell you to do something, do it. For reference, our current moderators are: [list goes here]**<br><br>J: All discovered mimes will be thrown into a pit, which may or may not be filled with various objects such as scorpions upon their availability.<br><br>J.5: There will be no clemency for these mimes until they learn the words.<br><br>* My example isn&#39;t very good, I know. If anyone&#39;s got a better one, feel free to put it there.<br>** I&#39;m actually not sure who all the current mods are, which is why I&#39;m suggesting a list.</p>

            <p>Your suggestion looks pretty good to me, and looks like it includes everything mentioned so far, but there is one point that I&#39;m not sure about, and that&#39;s J.<br><br>I&#39;m not aware of any official anti-mime policy within the PPC, so I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s just a joke (and possibly a reference to Lord Vetinari from Discworld), and while it does seem to fit with the slightly absurd nature of the PPC, it could also be seen to somewhat devalue the rest of the points. <br><br>Earlier in this thread, people have been talking about closing off any loopholes to prevent exploitation by rules-lawyers, and I would consider this to be akin to a loophole in that someone could say &#39;Well, <i>that</i> point wasn&#39;t meant to be taken seriously, so why should I listen to the others?&#39;. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a particularly good reason, but it&#39;s the kind of excuse that I could see someone trying if they were intentionally stirring things up, and those kind of arguments can drag on and just spoil things for other people. It&#39;s probably best to avoid them from the start. </p>

            <p>Safe-spacing is now pretty mainstream in cohesive communities.  It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to ask people to leave homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism and ablism at the door.  We should always strive to be slightly better than the youtube comments section . . .<br><br>At the same time, it would be great if we didn&#39;t develop a vigilante culture where people are not permitted to move on from past mistakes <b><i>after acknowledging and correcting them</i></b>.  The PPC helped me work through my own internalised homophobia when I was only just starting to come out to myself, and I happen to know I&#39;m not the only one.<br><br>If they&#39;d instead gone all SOCIAL-JUSTICE-WARRIOR-HULK-SMASH, it would have been a much more lonely and painful process, and I wouldn&#39;t have had anywhere safe to land after completing it.  It feels good to dispense the fire of righteous justice from above, but when it&#39;s dispensed indiscriminately, people who are genuinely trying to do better have nowhere to do it.  And some people who desperately need safe spaces are thrown out into the cold.<br><br>However: the PPC isn&#39;t the place for people who legitimately can&#39;t be bothered with basic human decency.  If someone says, &quot;Ow, you&#39;re stepping on my face,&quot; the correct response is, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m terribly sorry, I didn&#39;t realise and will remove my foot forthwith.&quot;  Not, &quot;Good.  Let me step a little bit harder.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. So be nice! Treat everyone else in the PPC with respect!&quot;</i><br><br>. . . or leave.  I&#39;m happy with making an amendment to further clarify that when we say &quot;be nice&quot; we do actually, you know, mean it.  We shouldn&#39;t feel obligated to tolerate brutality.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think we have to worry about a vigilante culture developing here- after all, a sound chunk announced that they would rather leave than not be in accordance with the rules.

            <p>I&#39;m thrown that things have been allowed to end up like this in the first place. As other people have said, the PPC has always been a safe space for me - a spot in the world where, no matter what kind of bad stuff&#39;s been happening to me, I&#39;m going to feel protected. And that was because one of the major defining rules of this place as I perceived them was <i>&quot;Thou shalt not make anyone else feel hurt or upset, and if someone tells thee thou hast done so, even unintentionally, thou shalt take responsibility, apologise, and quit it.&quot;</i> And it&#39;s suddenly not like that any more.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to leave - in fact, I will be extremely miserable if it comes to that - and putting up some extra safeguards seems like a good way to start resolving the issues that have blown up.

So we can learn to pick ourselves back up again.&quot;<br>That&#39;s what the PPC needs to do now, and I really hope it manages to, because even from the little I have seen up until now, it seems the people here do want to try and do good by the world. Safeguards are increasingly necessary nowadays, though, especially regarding topics which tend to have strong opinions on all sides.<br>As such, I agree the Constitution should include this update, and the update should be enforced.<br><br>Also, another suggestion: most boards and forums have a group of admins whose job it is to handle such things and remove posts not conforming to the appropriate site rules. Is this part of the PGs jobs, should it be or should there be other boarders voted in to carry out this function?</p>

            <p>Well, there are some problems there, under our current board system. Banning from the board is done by banning an IP address, not a name, but I believe we can only have a certain number of IPs banned at a time. Also, since it does done by IP and not name, that means that someone who has their private IP banned can still log in from pretty much any other internet connection, like a library or a cafe with wi-fi.<br><br>Really, the only effective method of enforcing a ban, or making sure someone who has been asked to leave doesn&#39;t come back would be to have the Nameless Admin delete any new posts they make, as soon as they were spotted. Unfortunately, the Admin is the only one who <i>can</i> delete posts and/or register bans, which could potentially lead to an unfortunate amount of work on their end.</p>

            <p>...just because I agree with updating the Constitution, but the PPC Posting Board also needs a way to enforce it. Unfortunately not all people, when politely asked to leave, will necessarily leave, especially if they have decided they want to start flaming. Hopefully this will not happen, but it cannot be guaranteed.<br><br>In light of recent events, we must not forget to cover this base too. It might be an idea to have a plan B if the Nameless Admin gets overloaded, or if somebody finds a way around the IP block/the site runs out of IP blocks available. I hate to say it, but necessity might be driving us towards a new site. <br><br>I for one would be a lot happier if the login button worked. As it currently stands, somebody could come in, flame under an existing member&#39;s name and get an innocent Boarder banned. If we&#39;re looking to fill in loopholes, that is a BIG one.</p>

            <p><i>...somebody could come in, flame under an existing member&#39;s name and get an innocent Boarder banned.</i><br><br>First off, the IP addresses are visible. It would be very, very easy** to check the IP on the flame post against a Boarder&#39;s usual IP address, and note that the post was not made by them. (Likewise, if a Boarder starts flaming anonymously, unless they&#39;re careful, it&#39;s very easy to figure out who it is.*) Also, we do have people who are very good at techno-y things, who can figure out things like where a post came from, and other mysterious... um... things. Anyway.<br><br>The login button has never worked, as long as I can remember. If we are going to try and make this a Really Secure Place with a Really Secure Login, we&#39;re back to talking about another forum altogether. Which is a solution that, IIRC, is being brainstormed by some of the afore-mentioned smart and techno-y people.<br><br>So in the meantime, enforcement as done by the &#39;Board - namely, &quot;No, you&#39;ve broken the rules and harassed/bullied people, you&#39;ve been given chances to apologize but instead continued to bully/harass, you&#39;re no longer welcome here,&quot; is about enough. If people try to start a flame-war, the Nameless Admin has proven quite capable of shutting that down - if they can stop the ypur invasion two (three?) years in a row, I have full confidence they can stop a disgruntled former Boarder in their tracks.<br><br>*Note: this also applies to &#39;Anonymous&#39; replies on debate and argument threads! Don&#39;t bother, dudes. Nobody is going to see a salient point and go &quot;Ah, that&#39;s wise, but-- <i>Oh My God</i>, it&#39;s that horrible ZombieVectorDude saying it! How DARE they weigh in on a serious issue after failing at permission/only being here a few days/not being super best friends with everyone!&quot; Nobody is going to run you off the &#39;Board for disagreeing with them on a point of IP security, or what have you. Nobody is going to rise up and tell you you&#39;re not allowed to talk here, because you don&#39;t have permission yet. Just sign your name.<br><br>**Probably. Most of the time.

            <p>This entire situation has really hit home for me. I&#39;ve tried to avoid it, but I can&#39;t anymore. It&#39;s a problem that, I think, is silently plaguing the entire Internet - especially communities like the PPC.<br><br>I do not like getting into fights on the Internet. In fact, I do not like getting into fights period, but on the Internet it&#39;s different, because we&#39;re all semi-anonymous. Even if someone uses their real name, we don&#39;t really know each other. I&#39;m going to be brutally honest here: when I have a conversation with a close friend in the real world, I know a lot about them and I recognize them a real person. When I have a conversation with a stranger on the Internet, they&#39;re just... someone. A screenname. A robot, for all I care.<br><br>The problem, I suppose, is that there is a significant difference between &quot;a screenname&quot; and &quot;a robot&quot;. And these two personalities simply do not mesh.<br><br>On the pure level of polite conversation, this view of the world actually works. I believe this is because at that level, we are calm, able to process information well. Therefore, the other party can be viewed as a screenname - a person. A faraway person, perhaps, and most likely a complete stranger, but still, at the very least, a person. For a person, we have sympathy, and sympathy begets ceasefire and peace.<br><br>But once something changes in that mix - say, a rude or hate-filled or unbridled remark - it boils over. The other person stops being a person and becomes a robot. A robot has no emotion. It is cold and mechanical, and it means nothing. If we view a person as a robot, then we feel free to sling as much mud at them as possible, and it becomes war.<br><br>The obvious solution to the problem is not to throw the first punch at all, but to just behave like little angels. But the odds of that happening are so low that it&#39;s pretty much a joke. I must say I like the zero-tolerance proposal, even if it is harsh, because it&#39;s a step towards that idyllic, if implausible, utopia.<br><br>But I also have this to say: when the first punch is thrown, it is best to remember the primary difference between a robot and a person.<br><br>If you tear a robot into a million pieces, nothing of much significance happens, and you are allowed to continue living life as usual.<br><br>If you tear a person into a million pieces, you are a murderer.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, the bottom line is that if people are hurt, whoever&#39;s been saying the hurtful things should shut up, and fast. If they don&#39;t shut up of their volition, they should be silenced.

            <p>The PPC has been for a long time (a very long time for some members) a place that maintained safety simply because we could trust our fellow members to not fail to grow and learn. It is a very sad time when we have to admit that the PPC has grown large enough that we cannot always trust every person that knocks on our doors.<br><br>We need a plan in place to deal with emergencies. I feel like if we have a short clear list, then we will be able to deal with these potentially very harmful topics before they get this out of hand. <br><br>It won&#39;t stop every argument that crops up, but I still have   trust that the PPC can arbitrate the lesser issues without abusing any emergency plan that is worked out.<br><br>We can, and should, respect each other&#39;s cultures and opinions as equally valid, but we cannot allow that to extend to a position of absolute relativism where <i>any</i> variation is equally valid. Some people and cultures find it perfectly valid to violate things that are identified as basic human rights. Some things (basic human rights violations) have to be considered clearly wrong. When I say I agree with a list of things that are zero tolerance items, these are the kinds of things I am agreeing to being on it.</p>

            <p>I am leaving the PPC.  Probably forever.<br><br>I first joined a couple years back, roughly May of 2010.  Stuff happened, and I wound up never posting outside my intro thread.  Then, in October of 2010, I came back.<br><br>It felt good to be in a community that was so welcoming and warm, especially since at the time I was living away from home at a boarding school full time, and had just moved halfway across the province.<br><br>After a couple of months, I figured out what felt good about it.<br><br>I felt at home.  I felt like I could trust the people here.<br><br>I am the first to admit that I have problems.  I&#39;ve gone on hiatus many times in the past to deal with whatever was going on with me offline.  I&#39;d generally return in a week or so.<br><br>This time is different.<br><br>I no longer feel at home.  I no longer feel safe.  I no longer feel wanted.<br><br>It&#39;s back to how I was when I first came here.<br><br>Somehow, the PPC has reached a point where it is <i>too</i> accepting.  Where people like Jacer, who offend and hurt people are allowed to stay.  In her Permission thread below, I linked to the original thread that started all of this.<br><br>Ever since that thread, I have never felt safe when seeing Jacer&#39;s name anywhere on the Board.  I do not feel safe with somebody who is so firmly against me as a person.<br><br>Look, I get it.  Second chances are important.  But you know what?  When somebody hurts somebody else, and hurts them <i>badly</i>, they better damn well <i>earn</i> that second chance.<br><br>Jacer did not.<br><br>She showed no signs of remorse, or even of acknowledging that she hurt people in that thread.  Nor did she when it got brought up again now.<br><br>That is not a sign of needing a second chance.<br><br>She should never have been allowed to stay.  None of the current mess would have happened if somebody had stepped up and said &quot;No.  Hurting people is not okay here.  Especially not if you show no signs of feeling the <i>slightest</i> remorse for what you did.&quot;<br><br>And yet she was.<br><br>She was allowed to stay on, given a second chance.<br><br>Which she used.  She was given a third chance, which she used.<br><br>She was given a fourth chance.<br><br>A year later, and she still shows no sign of caring in the slightest that she wasted her first chance.<br><br>This should never have gotten that bad.<br><br>Why is it that we immediately told DoctorHello that they were not welcome in their intro thread after what they said?  To the point where <i>that thread no longer exists</i>?<br><br>What is the difference here?<br><br>Why is it, that when I say &quot;No.  It is not okay that you hurt people&quot; I get told &quot;NO.  YOU MUST RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF THOSE THAT HAVE HURT YOU.&quot;?<br><br>From people I trusted and respected, no less?<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot stay in this mess.<br><br>I cannot stay in a place that not only allows people to continue hurting others, but <i>yells at the ones who have been hurt</i>.<br><br>The PPC is welcoming and friendly to the point where you cannot even <i>think</i> of telling somebody off.<br><br>And in the end, it is no longer a safe place.<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>ADDENDUM: Letting people like Jacer stay is just as bad as taking part in the bullying.<br><br>Please learn something from my leaving, although I honestly doubt that will happen.<br><br>I&#39;d like to say it was good knowing you all, but the past few days have kind of ruined that.</p>

I&#39;m not going to try and convince you to stay, though I and plenty of others would like you to, because if a place no longer feels safe, you should be able to walk away.</p>

            <p>This needs to be expanded.<br><br>Tray, you&#39;ve always been one of the people I liked the most here. I love how every time I got on the IRC you&#39;d glomp me to say hello. I love how you were always so nice. I loved that story you told me about how you and your college friends drove that git who wouldn&#39;t stop playing dub step to tears with the power of the nyan cat over a couple of days. I loved that weird conversation we had with Plat about being tied up with duct tape. I love how you were always such a good person.<br><br>In short: not only are you someone I&#39;m damn proud to call a friend, you&#39;re also someone I&#39;m proud to share my sexual orientation with. <br><br>Whatever happens, just know that there&#39;s more than a few people here who&#39;ll always count you as a friend, OK?<br><br>AV</p>

            <p>I... understand where you&#39;re coming from. I can&#39;t understand why this is enough to make you leave, but then I am not you so I cannot say what your breaking point is. I simply know you as a very fun person to be around and talk to on the IRC, and I... I hope that, if Jacer leaves and stays left and we as a group can figure out the best way to deal with someone who says the things she does and not tolerate intolerance...

            <p>But, from what I gathered, the new post highlight was yellow too in the beginning, until it was changed because, heck, it was <i>yellow</i>. That could have messed up the CSS.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a rather new issue, though. Could it have something to do with the fact that the post highlight color (which has once been yellow) has been changed to gray?</p>

            <p>I know you&#39;re trying to help. I know there&#39;s a lot of tension, and you want it to go away and for all of us to just get along, and friendship and happiness and love and tolerance.<br><br>But <i>triggers</i>*, they exist, and when something like this happens, the best way to respond is not to go &quot;I know this thing is specifically what triggers some of you, but look at the bright side!&quot; Which is kinda what this amounts to. The best way to end this, generally, is to apologize, sincerely, and Let. It. Go.<br><br>Seriously. I&#39;ve done this, in the past, after arguing or fighting with friends. You want things to go back to normal, but you also feel horribly guilty, so you desperately try to smooth things... like this. But this really doesn&#39;t help. Sometimes things smooth over with time, and sometimes they warp beyond repair and never heal. And that sucks - but either way, once you&#39;ve apologized, you have to wait. Doing stuff like this, though it might help you feel better, doesn&#39;t help the people you&#39;re ostensibly apologizing <i>to</i>. So - please don&#39;t.<br><br>And, lastly - you are kinda preaching to the choir, here, in a big way. The people who will be causing problems by attacking and harassing QUILTBAG folks around here... are the people who are not going to read this, or are going to reply to it angrily no matter how much sense it makes. So by posting this stuff in the wake of a thread like that, you&#39;re sort of... just stirring things up. And sort of being a bit twisty with giving lip-service to Neshomeh asking the comment thread to calm down by replying to it up here. Just, generally - I hope with all my heart that this situation never arises again, but in the case that it does... don&#39;t do this.

            <p>Recently at college there was a team quiz in English Literature. Now, as someone who remembers details of the various continua, I was very happy about this.<br>However, each team had to think up a question to ask the other two teams. This is where there were Problems.<br>First, no-one (apart from me) knew the name of the main antagonist from Watership Down.<br>Second, me and the person who set the question were the only people who knew Remus Lupin&#39;s middle name. (Which is more a sign of my geekery.)<br>Finally, the actual annoyance. Another team asked: What is the name of <b>the</b> White Wizard from Lord of the Rings? I pointed out there were two answers and was treated as though I was completely insane.<br>I just thought you guys were the sort of people who would find this either amusing or annoying.<br></p>

            <p>I have been making plans for agents for about four weeks now by my calculation, so I thought I would put my ideas for a duo here for your perusal. Here they are:<br><br>Eagrus Khan - he is a bit character who was rescued from a Lord of the Rings badfic and subsequently recruited. He has a great dislike of bad spelling due to the fact that he is an Esterling (rather than an Easterling, being a victim of bad spelling himself). He looks much like an Easterling, but an odd smell of fruit tends to follow him around. He is a trained swordsman by background but being from a fantasy continuum is still struggling to get to grips with technology.<br><br>Cyba Zero - she was initially from World One but ended up in HQ when a pair of agents temporarily mistook her for an escaped Shapeshifter!Sue. The real Sue was caught and Cyba decided to join the battle against the Sues. During training she suffered a mishap with an old and malfunctioning disguise generator, leaving her with the body of a Borg drone. Fortunately her mind was untouched and she did not mind the physical change too much (after recovering from the shock). Having never been linked to the hive mind, however, she is still trying to learn how to use her implants - with much hilarity along the way. The change also left her irresistibly drawn to the colour red, leaving her extremely vulnerable to distraction. Being in disguise, while removing all species-specific abilities of her new natural form, does not stop the red issue. As such, Eagrus has to remain vigilant whenever the colour is around and keep Cyba focused.</p>

            <p>I am presuming she is supposed to basically be you, yes?<br><br>How was Cyba mistaken for a Sue in the first place? What was she doing that led to them believing she was the Sue? Agents have the ability to test for this. Were they not doing their job properly? Or was she acting Sueish enough that they felt they did&#39;t need to check? And if it was the second, why would they allow her to go with?  <br><br><i>Why</i> is your Agent Cyba Borged? You say that it was due to a disguise generator accident, but that&#39;s a &#39;how&#39;. I&#39;d like to know why you decided to go with this route. <br><br>What advantages does this give her over your average human/humanoid agent? You say she can&#39;t control the implants, but I would presume that she does gain control over time, and there is also the fact that some of it is innate- like the phaser fire immunity and the strength.<br><br>Does she get any disadvantages? <br><br>Why are you deciding to have this set up <i>beforehand</i>, rather than in the progress of your spinoff? This is the sort of thing that makes up a character&#39;s progression and a storyline. This is interesting stuff, so why have it happen before and then remove all of the most interesting aspects of it from your spinoff completely? <br><br>Another thing I want to ask you to consider: Why do you want your agent insert of yourself (presuming she is intended to be you) to be a Borg and thus have the advantages Borgs get? If it&#39;s to make her unique or to give her something to make her other than &#39;normal human&#39; you should reconsider it.<br><br>Normal humans (or humanoids with no special abilities) <i>should</i> be the majority of PPC agents; Jay and Acacia were normal humans and did their jobs swimmingly. Trojie&#39;s a normal human. Miah&#39;s a normal human (or was, last time I checked). Constance was, and was utterly terrifying regardless.<br><br>I can make a long, long list of agents that have no special abilities or advantages that do a bangup job without them. <br></p>

            <p>The Sue in question was a particularly nasty Shapeshifter!Sue. Cyba and her doppelganger were proving difficult to catch, so the agent pair used their spare Remote Activator to open a portal in front of where Cyba and the Sue were running. This portal went to a spot just in front of a wall in HQ, meaning that Cyba and the Sue both ran into it and knocked themselves out. It was at that point that the agents managed to use their CADs and tell the difference.<br><br>Of course, this could be changed.<br><br>In answer to the why question:<br><br>1. Firstly, Borg was my nickname at university for being a perfectionist, so it seemed appropriate.<br><br>2. I can lever a lot of humour with her weaknesses. The transformation was not without its errors (the generator was faulty after all). She gets helplessly distracted by anything red, which is a major weakness. Some of the mission challenge lies in Eagrus keeping her focused rather than wandering off following something red. She won&#39;t attack it or anything like that, but following behind in a trance could very well get her noticed by non-canons if her partner is not vigilant.<br><br>3. Having some strengths that actually do not necessarily do much good thanks to the associated weaknesses has a lot of humour potential.  <br><br>4.I intend to take the normally accepted mechanics and turn them about for comedy. For instance, think of picking up a glass of water when you do not know your own strength - you are probably going to get wet. I also cannot imagine sleeping standing up is very easy... Cyba is NOT going to get an easy time of it. She will probably learn control eventually, but it does not have to be quick or without its slip-ups.<br><br>5. Remember Eagrus is not exactly well versed with technology. Having a partner who is part technology is going to get...interesting - in the amusing sense of course.<br><br>6. I admit that I like cyborgs. However, that means I know how to make humour out of them. I intend to keep the  reigns tight on any levels of power. For a start, Eagrus would NOT be happy without his fair share of bad spelling busting!<br><br>Her advantages are non-existent outside HQ - disguise generators are very handy in that regard.<br><br>Disadvantages: the red issue, as per above. This does NOT go away when in disguise. Also, her learning curve: trying to get used to a new natural form is bad enough without changing forms through being in disguise. Expect some clumsiness on missions!<br><br>As for why to do it beforehand, a lot of my humour ideas revolve around the effects of the transformation. I guess some of it is also my eagerness; it could be saved until later if necessary.<br><br>Thanks for the cross-checking. I hope that answers your questions.</p>

            <p>Thinking about it further, the accident could wait a little while. After all, a faulty disguise generator could cause other, smaller problems before blowing completely - such as giving a mostly correct disguise with a slight glitch etc. That way I could work up to things. Thank you JulyFlame for provoking that line of thought...the internal ideas generator is off again with even more laughs promised. Goody this is going to be fun!<br><br>I still need to decide what to write as a writing sample though... I was thinking maybe a quick comedy sketch or something; would that work? How important is length? I read the Wiki, but I just want to clarify further to be sure.</p>

            <p>Your behavior outside of the PPC community and in it has shown that you do not have the best intent in your heart, or the spirit of the PPC in mind.<br><br>About a year ago, in a thread about LGBT, you publicly condemned several people for being who they are, and for not believing the same things as you. When someone confronted you in private over it, you proceeded to mock them for differences in religious belief and opinion on others after the fact in your LiveJournal. <br><br>This was brought to the awareness of another PPCer, who spoke to you about it.<br><br>You didn&#39;t delete those entries. You just hid them from public view. <br><br>You show off proudly several &#39;exchanges&#39; where you harass and mock people for writing things they like. Your friend, Antaprate took your side and defended you and accused them of flaming you. <br><br>Antaprate has her own fanfiction.net account where she proudly declares she holds grudges against people, and that if people wanted to find her Kat &quot;the fanfic slayer&quot; stories, they could PM her for them. <br><br>This goes somewhat against her being an agent, doesn&#39;t it? There&#39;s nothing in your Dreamwidth there, or on your Tripod site saying you don&#39;t own that person or her character. This is very odd behavior, because if Antaprate was a real person, wouldn&#39;t you want the people reading those things to know? <br><br>You are also using Antaprate&#39;s character Kat, who was, as previously noted, was used as a Sue Slayer who was sent on a <i>mission from God</i> with all sorts of powers to eliminate characters you decided were Mary Sues.<br><br>Sockpuppeting to try and protect yourself from the people you have belittled and insulted for writing fic you don&#39;t agree with goes against the spirit of the community. You have denied that you and Antaprate are the same person elsewhere, but here you are using them as a character.<br><br>The PPC does not abide of bullying people, or of harassing them. It does not approve of reposting the works of others in very public places to mock them further, which you have done under your alter ego&#39;s name, with that intent stated. <br><br>It also doesn&#39;t approve of pretending to be someone else to continue harassing and bullying people and to defend yourself.<br><br>Additionally, you have a multitude of Sues that you are still writing, and you wrote and posted a PPC piece without permission that was not a permission piece. </p>

            <p>I had help writing this response. I was too upset.<br><br>Regarding your response declining my request for permisson to write for the PPC, you will of course understand my disappointment.  That said, however, I have some concerns about your interpretation of some of my in your response, particularly with the thread-from May of last year that addressed LGBT issues.<br><br>While I am not noticeably subtle in many of remarks therein, I think they were frequently interpreted by other respondents in a manner not intended by me, and in language at least as vociferous as mine, which impugned the veracity and source of my arguments, even while they – too often – went on to make counter-arguments with assertions that are in error as a matter of historical record. Note that in this regard I do not attribute this to malign intent on their part, just not doing sufficient homework before responding, a common problem in modern discourse.<br><br>All in all, I feel like I have labeled the “bad girl”, even while my similarly intense critics have gotten off scot-free.<br><br>My question at this point is whether your concern with my remarks is chiefly with the form (i.e., they are not likely to be confused with diplomacy) or with the content (i.e., they are not politically correct). A number of respondents in the thread in question seemed to talk a good game regarding giving my reasons for my position, but when I responded that they derive from my religious convictions, I received a deluge of opprobrium.  The typical response indicated that “you can&#39;t force your religious beliefs on others”.  Well, if they mean I can&#39;t create a theocracy, and force them to believe in the divinity of Jesus, as a matter of law, they are of course correct – that is what the Constitution is for.<br><br>On the other hand, if my religious beliefs inform me that, e.g., “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not steal” are universal truths binding on all people, then I retain the right of free speech to advance those positions, those values, even unto law, – that is also what the Constitution is for – regardless of whether it is part of Catholic teaching, Hindu teaching or Epicurean teaching, because the issue is not “where does this idea come from”, but rather “is it true”. Determining whether it is true is destined to be a matter of much political discussion, of course, but the fundamental idea that those informed by religious convictions have just as much right in the public square to advance their ideas is squarely supported in the Constitution, and the those who hold that they do not are anti-intellectual at best, and anti-religious at worst.<br><br>The following addresses your concerns point by point. If you still disagree, please respond by citing the actual text of mine that you are referencing so I can be sure exactly what words you are addressing.<br><br>“Your behavior outside of the PPC community and in it has shown that you do not have the best intent in your heart, or the spirit of the PPC in mind.<br><br>“About a year ago, in a thread about LGBT, you publicly condemned several people for being who they are, and for not believing the same things as you.”<br><br><br>No. I didn’t. I didn’t condemn <i>anyone</i>. What I did was attempt to defend my position against an onslaught of “you’re wrong, you’re stupid, you’re an idiot, the Bible sux.” I notice you don’t mention all the insults I received then. <i>I</i> was condemned. It is not my job as a Christian to be lukewarm about sin.<br><br>“When someone confronted you in private over it, you proceeded to mock them for differences in religious belief and opinion on others after the fact in your LiveJournal.<br><br>“This was brought to the awareness of another PPCer, who spoke to you about it.”<br><br>I’m sorry, I have no idea what you’re talking about.<br><br>“You didn&#39;t delete those entries. You just hid them from public view.”<br><br>Of course I didn’t delete the exchanges. I don’t delete <i>anything</i>. Old fics I’ve never finished, old <i>versions</i> of fics that I’ve edited, edited character profiles on the LJ, all the papers I got in school for the last eight years....I still have them all. I’m a pack rat. I keep everything. Why is this a problem?<br><br>“You show off proudly several &#39;exchanges&#39; where you harass and mock people for writing things they like.”<br><br>I never said I was proud. I suppose you feel the same way about fandom_wank, which does the same thing. This is really not fair. The PPC also mocks people who write things they like, but I get attacked for posting conversations with people who drove me nuts? Even when most of them were privatized <i>last October</i>?<br><br>“Your friend, Antaprate took your side and defended you and accused them of flaming you.”<br><br>Once. Maybe twice. In <i>February of 2011</i>. Why does this have bearing?<br><br>“Antaprate has her own fanfiction.net account where she proudly declares she holds grudges against people,”<br><br>I am not going to deny that I am Antaprate. It was the name of a spell I created, and I needed an extra account to post my My Immortal project. The “grudges” part came after certain people (not PPCers) decided that, despite repeated attempts to explain to them, they had the ability to inform me why I wrote things. Which was patently false, and really got on my nerves. The only reason I ever denied being A was for the benefit of one single FF user, and I’m pretty sure she figured it out so it’s a moot point. The only time I ever actively socked with Anta was, as before mentioned, in <i>February 2011</i>.<br><br>“and that if people wanted to find her Kat &quot;the fanfic slayer&quot; stories, they could PM her for them.”<br><br>Yes. I deleted them from FF.net after the above-mentioned people made me angry. I save everything, so I posted them somewhere else. They’ve been gone for a few months now. Why is this bad?<br><br><br>“This goes somewhat against her being an agent, doesn&#39;t it? There&#39;s nothing in your Dreamwidth there, or on your Tripod site saying you don&#39;t own that person or her character.”<br><br>I suppose the more obvious “Girl names agent after friend’s screen name” din’t occur to you.<br><br>“You are also using Antaprate&#39;s character Kat,”<br><br>No. You’re wrong. Kat the Slayer is not Kat the Agent. They happen to share the same nickname, sex, and hair color. That is all. A name does not a character make, as many badfic character replacement writers have yet to learn.<br><br>“who was, as previously noted, was used as a Sue Slayer who was sent on a <i>mission from God</i> with all sorts of powers to eliminate characters you decided were Mary Sues.”<br><br>Isn’t that exactly what the PPC does? God=Flowers, powers and gadgets=DoSAT gadgets, Mary Sues=Mary Sues. I don’t see why this is a problem.<br><br>“Sockpuppeting to try and protect yourself from the people you have belittled and insulted for writing fic you don&#39;t agree with goes against the spirit of the community.”<br><br>I also have another FF account, which I use to favorite Supernatural fics. Is this also socking? I don’t actively sock. A was originally created as an extra account, not a sock. And don’t we all do this, posting PPC missions on LJ and what not rather than with our FF names? Isn’t the PPC <i>about</i> mocking badfic?<br><br>“You have denied that you and Antaprate are the same person elsewhere, but here you are using them as a character.”<br><br>I repeat the part about the excuse, and the non-denial.<br><br>“The PPC does not abide of bullying people, or of harassing them.”<br><br>I don’t bully, any more than the PPC does by writing missions.<br><br>“It does not approve of reposting the works of others in very public places to mock them further, which you have done under your alter ego&#39;s name, with that intent stated.”<br><br>Since when is laughing at intentional trollfics is not allowed? This is news to me.<br><br>“It also doesn&#39;t approve of pretending to be someone else to continue harassing and bullying people and to defend yourself.”<br><br>I didn’t.<br><br>“Additionally, you have a multitude of Sues that you are still writing,”<br><br>Please explain why my characters are Sues. This was not brought up last time I requested Permission.<br><br>“and you wrote and posted a PPC piece without permission that was not a permission piece.”<br><br>I fully believed I was allowed to do that, judging from the “non-continuity-affecting” comments on the Permission page. And I quote from my entry: “This is not continuity-affecting whatsoever, so hopefully I&#39;m allowed to post it without Permission. If I&#39;m not, leave a message on my wiki talk page and I&#39;ll take it down.” I never got a message, so I left it up.<br><br>I am disturbed that in order to prove I am a nasty person, you are citing events that happened from nine to seventeen months ago. Why, if they were a problem, were they not mentioned <i>last</i> time I requested Permission? Why was the supposed Sueness of my OCs not brought up then? You never explain why you think my characters are Sues, either.<br><br>Last time it was “Your characters’ backstory doesn’t make sense,” and I fixed that. Why the sudden attack?<br><br>I have deliberately not commented on things like that for months. Why am I automatically in the wrong?</p>

            <p><b><i>“Additionally, you have a multitude of Sues that you are still writing,”</i><br><br>Please explain why my characters are Sues. This was not brought up last time I requested Permission.</b><br><br>I have now read your fic, &quot;Call Me Katie&quot;. I&#39;ll be honest with you, if I had come across this fic in a random fic hunt, I would have sporked it. This is one of the most blatant Sues that I have seen in a long time. There is a lengthy Author&#39;s Note in the last chapter that says that you wrote most of this in 2010, and you think your writing has improved greatly since then. It makes it clear that this was posted May 31, 2012. No where in that note did you state that you had realized this was a huge Sue, and you were only leaving it up to show your progress, so I consider all decisions in this story as something you currently condone.<br><br>First charge: Katie is the uncanonical sister of the Main Character, Coraline.<br><br>Second Charge: This is not a new story. This is a rehash of the movie, only with Katie shoehorned in. <br><br>Third Charge: Katie steals multiple lines from Coraline and is the one that the doll imitates, until Coraline is only a very minor character in her own canon.<br><br>Fourth Charge: Katie&#39;s presence drums up drama for no apparent reason other than to make her more important in the story. (The mom&#39;s unspecified accident is now Katie&#39;s fault, and they spend half a scene arguing over it.)<br><br>Fifth Charge: In-line Author&#39;s Notes like this one, parenthesis yours. (A/N: this sentence makes me laugh and laugh).)<br><br>Sixth charge: Calling the mom by her name throughout (okay, that one might have just fallen under annoying a PPC agent)<br><br>Seventh charge: Mothering Coraline <br><br>Eighth charge: Changing the mythos of the canon to be able to add your Sue in. There was only one doll. Coraline said so. The doll changes to match the victim. There was no way for a second doll to appear just so you could have your Sue and Coraline enter the Other World.<br><br><br><br><br><br>This is from your Narnia story about Ailena, which is also not labeled as something you have come to regret.<br><br>Ailena has cobalt blue eyes, hip length blond hair, ten different names, and an entire paragraph longer than the one I am about to quote explaining how old she is.<br><br><b>Ailena is extremely good with many weapons, seems to turn up at unexpected times and in unexpected places, appears to know some things before they happen, and is particularly close to Aslan. She has been around since before the beginning of Narnia and remains there until the very end. She ages very, very slowly. She is High Queen of Narnia with the Pevensies during the Golden Age, and is never paired with anyone romantically. Never ever ever, through all the years of Narnia. She is also the one who tells C.S. Lewis the stories of Narnia.</b><br><br>Let&#39;s take this bit by bit. <br><br><b>Ailena is extremely good with many weapons</b> One of the hallmarks of Sues are that they are good at everything, better than most, with very little effort. You say she&#39;s lived a very long time, so maybe she&#39;s practiced for thousands of years, but I honestly doubt it.<br><br><b>seems to turn up at unexpected times and in unexpected places,</b> This is a Speshul trait.<br><br><b>appears to know some things before they happen</b> Since this isn&#39;t available in canon, this is also a Speshul trait.<br><br><b>, and is particularly close to Aslan.</b> So, she is a personal friend of the canon&#39;s deity? Do you see how this is a Sue-ish trait?<br><br><b>She has been around since before the beginning of Narnia and remains there until the very end.</b> She was being shoehorned into a very select group of characters here.<br><br><b>She is High Queen of Narnia with the Pevensies during the Golden Age, and is never paired with anyone romantically. Never ever ever, through all the years of Narnia. </b> This seems to be a recurring theme in your stories, where you retell the canon stories only your versions are better, because they include your characters, who are much better than the canons, and outshine the canons. That is, honestly,  the very definition of a Mary Sue.<br><br><b>She is also the one who tells C.S. Lewis the stories of Narnia.</b> This is just. Wow. This character is so important that she told the writer of her world about the world, so he wasn&#39;t really writing a story, he was just repeating back what your character told him. The time loop-fourth wall breakage thing here is actually painful. That is a pretty bold claim, and makes this character a huge, huge Mary Sue.<br><br>I understand from reading other bits on your LJ that this character is old. I have heard that it is fairly normal to go through a stage of creating Mary Sues (even I can remember back to doing that, I just didn&#39;t write them down), but the thing is that you are still writing this character and apparently don&#39;t see anything wrong with her. If you can&#39;t see anything wrong with this character, then you are not at a mature enough place to write for the PPC, and July was absolutely right in denying you Permission.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

Isn’t the PPC about mocking badfic?&quot;<br>&quot;I don’t bully, any more than the PPC does by writing missions.&quot;</b><br><br>Posting PPC stories on sites other than the Pit isn&#39;t sockpuppeting; it&#39;s keeping our shared universe within our little group.  This is for two reasons.  First, because we don&#39;t like getting much attention from the internet-at-large, to avoid becoming the focus of trolls and such.  The other reason, and the one I believe you&#39;re having trouble understanding, is that <i>we do not want to hurt the feelings of badfic authors</i>.  We keep our community on the down-low because we want to entertain each other with jokes created from bad writing, not because we want to smear that bad writing in its authors&#39; faces.<br><br>The PPC does not bully.  The PPC is about finding humor by mocking badfic, not by mocking badfic authors.<br><br><b>&quot;Isn’t that exactly what the PPC does? God=Flowers . . .&quot;</b><br><br>No.  No, no, no.  A million times no.  There is a huge difference between writing a character who takes orders from a fictional board of giant, sentient, speech-capable psychic talking plants in business suits, and writing a character who carries out the will of the actual, real life God.<br><br>Do you see how claiming to be doing the work of God Himself while critiquing a fan fiction is problematic?</p>

            <p>Having looked at the original thread (and thank you Tranum for posting the link - it&#39;s always better to know what&#39;s being referenced) I feel the need to agree with JulyFlame&#39;s decision. However, this does not mean Jacer is being denied a second chance. JulyFlame didn&#39;t try and demand Jacer leave the PPC, or say &#39;You will never be able to write for the PPC&#39;; she simply explained the reasons she was making the decision that Jacer would not be given Permission at this time. There has been a further comment (not from JulyFlame) implying that Jacer should leave the community, but in no way was it a demand. The second chance - one wherein Jacer proves her(?)self able to interact with the community in a constructive manner - is and always has been there.<br><br>Of course, the situation isn&#39;t quite as simple as it seems from JulyFlame&#39;s summary (naturally - it&#39;s a summary of the reasons Jacer&#39;s being turned down, not a reasoned argument seeing both sides and showing her working! Nor should it be, in this context). Holding the opinion that Jacer deserves a second chance - however that is interpreted - is perfectly valid, and definitely not a reason for anyone to call you a &#39;douchebag&#39;.<br><br>And since this isn&#39;t a summary, my working:<br><br>In Jacer&#39;s defence:<br><br>1/ The LGBT thread was over a year ago, which is a long time in the Interwebs. I haven&#39;t been following Jacer in between times, so I don&#39;t know how she(?)&#39;s behaved since.<br><br>2/ The explosion originally came about because Jacer stated her(?) opinion and people disagreed vehemently - and some (by no means all) disagreed with her right to express it on the Board. As a rule, saying &#39;You&#39;re wrong&#39; (which both sides did) is going to cause tempers to rise. Saying &#39;I disagree with your opinion&#39; is far more conducive to polite discussion.<br><br>3/ While Jacer did get progressively more vehement in support of views which were being shouted down - possibly to the extent of being deliberately offensive, I haven&#39;t read every post so that&#39;s a guess - I did see several responses which I would class as flames. One person (I forget who) declares Jacer a &#39;miscreant&#39;, which, er, is a direct insult serving no purpose but to deride the other. So getting increasingly emotional and &#39;fighting back&#39; would seem only natural.<br><br>On the other hand, and causing my opinion to fall out the way it does:<br><br>1/ Jacer&#39;s original post used not just loaded words - &#39;disorder&#39;, while an accurate statement of belief (I assume), was always going to cause controversy - but also straightforward insulting ones - &#39;disgusting&#39;. That&#39;s also a flame - it may not have been targetted at anyone specific, but it&#39;s still a flame.<br><br>2/ At certain points in the debate, Jacer said things that were, um, objectively wrong (such as the implication that while Jews and Muslims have immigrated to America, Catholics are native to the country), and refused to retract them. That&#39;s not debating in good faith, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be mirrored by other participants (again, that I&#39;ve noticed).<br><br>3/ There is the matter of the entire rest of JulyFlame&#39;s summary. Without access to the original data I can&#39;t comment on the specifics, but I trust JulyFlame to be truthful. And someone who sockpuppets, flames (my word, not hers) and currently writes Mary-Sues is not someone who should be writing PPC missions - regardless of conduct on the Board.<br><br>So, two - no, three final points.<br><br>1/ Everything I have said above is my opinion and perception of the situation. I may be wrong. I may be mistaken.<br><br>2/ I would like to invite Jacer to involve her(? sorry, no one can agree...)self in the PPC community and give people a more positive opinion of him(? hah, changed it around)self by his(?) conduct and presentation.<br><br>3/ I&#39;m going to quote my wife, from a post she made about a Board crisis waaaay back in 2003 (the Thalia Incident, specifically):<br><br><b>I&#39;ve been a regular at the PPC board for a fair few months, not long compared to some people, but a while, and this is the only time I have <em>ever</em> seen flames, except by trolls. Even when there are trolls, we rarely actually flame. The only time I have <em>ever</em> seen regulars get really upset at other regulars, or other &#39;names&#39;.<br><br>*sadly* O, shiny happy PPC board, what have they done to you?<br><br>But really, the board has been different lately. It&#39;s not just these cute little flames, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been noticing for a while.

            <p>I agree with JulyFlame&#39;s decision, entirely.<br><br>I also agree that &quot;No, we are not giving you permission to add to the PPC continuum&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;No, you are not allowed in the PPC ever again,&quot; and the former is correct, while the latter is not. Second chances, because where would any one of us be without them?<br><br>A theme that&#39;s been brought up here before is growth, and maturity - as writers and as people - and how part of our purpose is to help each other grow and mature.

            <p>I do not feel safe with Jacer around.<br><br>This is for a few reasons, the aforementioned thread being one of them.  Another one being an event that happened quite some time later, shortly after I had returned from a brief hiatus.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to go into much detail about what happened, because I was really not in a good place when this whole thing went down and I would kind of not like to go back to that.<br><br>Jacer made a reply to a thread on the Board on her FFN account (said thread being about Coming Out Day).  I found this through a permission request she made around the same time.  Several back and forth messages ensued.

This wound up being a... trigger for the &quot;not a good place&quot; bit I was talking about.<br><br>In short, I do not feel comfortable with Jacer&#39;s behaviour, nor do I feel safe with her on the Board.</p>

            <p>on a personal note, want to say that it is not okay to flame people by calling them a disease, a disorder, and/or disgusting. I had basically ignored that discussion from May 2011, and now I wish I hadn&#39;t, so I could have told the people hurt by those things that I support them as human beings who should have the same rights as other human beings. I am straight, married with three kids, and a Christian, so I was not a target of that thread, and I am sorry to everyone that I should have spoken up for sooner. I believe you shouldn&#39;t be discriminated against and targeted because of your gender or sexuality.</p>

            <p>Part of my issue with all this has to do with logical fallacies. In this case, just because somebody else last year got away with the same bad behavior doesn&#39;t mean that behavior is okay right now, or that we should excuse anyone for it right now, which is the impression I&#39;m getting from Jacer: &quot;How dare you accuse me of bad behavior, because those people did the same thing.&quot; That&#39;s not actually a relevant argument. While we should perhaps be talking to those people at some point, too, they aren&#39;t the ones asking for Permission in this thread, so their behavior doesn&#39;t bear on the discussion at all. Bringing them up is, consciously or not, just an attempt to distract us from the actual topic of discussion, which is <i>Jacer&#39;s</i> behavior. That&#39;s the fallacy.<br><br>Anyway... if it were just about one thread that got out of hand last year, I guess I&#39;d be more in favor of lenience, but it isn&#39;t. If nothing else, we&#39;re seeing a repeat of some of the same issues just in this thread: when confronted with disapproval, Jacer goes &quot;Why are you telling me this? You can&#39;t blame me, because I can&#39;t be wrong, because I don&#39;t agree with you that there&#39;s a problem. Look at those other people instead; <i>their</i> behavior is bad.&quot; <i>Lots</i> of shifting the blame and refusing to take responsibility for her words and/or actions. Without an intent to change, there can&#39;t really be a second chance, however much we&#39;d like to offer one.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Basically, what Tray said. Triggers do not care that Jacer is &#39;only&#39; words on a page. Triggers do not care that &#39;all&#39; Jacer is doing is typing words that happen to form into a pattern that can be deciphered into phonemes that coalesce into words that connect into sentences that are understood to mean &quot;Gays are mentally ill, trans* are mentally ill, they&#39;re wrong and against the natural order and will suffer for eternity after they die&quot;. Triggers are a reaction to memories that those words bring up, and since Jacer does not say in her subject line &quot;Oh yes I&#39;m saying things that could trigger those who have been bullied for being gay&quot; <i>no one can know that they could be triggered until they are triggered</i>. And by then? By then it&#39;s <i>too ...ing late</i>.<br><br>I define a trigger, from what I know of them, as when the natural fear/disgust/discomfort with something unpleasant gets to such a point that the triggered person becomes very much unable to function when confronted with the unpleasant material. It brings up thoughts, it brings up memories, that have incredibly powerful and unpleasant emotions attached, and those emotions are overwhelming. If these things aren&#39;t warned for? If these things are wherever? <i>They cannot be avoided</i>.<br><br>Triggers don&#39;t listen to logic, either. Take Jacer. Jacer has said some pretty vile things. Jacer, to those who have read her posts where she posts said pretty vile things, has become associated with pretty vile things. Even if you don&#39;t look at what she says, <i>glancing down the board</i> to see the latest posts <i>will</i> find her name if she has posted, and the memories <i>associated with</i> her name <i>are triggering</i>. <b>That</b> is how she makes the Board unsafe, at least in my mind. That and the possibility of her replying to a perfectly safe thread and spoiling the whole thing, because she&#39;s a rotten apple, and rot <i>spreads</i>. Everything else is tainted with the unpleasantness, and if the PPC Posting Board is associated with unpleasantness in someone&#39;s mind then they will find somewhere <i>not</i> associated with unpleasantness.<br><br>Right. Hopefully I haven&#39;t put words in anyone&#39;s mouth.</p>

If you had a problem with Tray, I think it would have been prudent to take it up in private when things have cooled down first. I think Tray would deserve at least that.<br><br>Second off, article 2!<br><br>&#39;It’s one thing to say &quot;I don’t agree with your opinion&quot; to a person, but entirely inappropriate to say &quot;You’re such a flipping idiot for thinking that, you flipping moron!”&#39;<br><br>I will have no qualms about calling a bigot a bigot, and saying their opinions are wrong, wrong and WRONG. I don&#39;t care about the Constitution, even if it explicitly barred that, because then the Constitution too would be wrong, wrong, wrong! Not all opinions are equal. This pretense has already killed off the political discourse of an entire country. <br><br>I am aghast that we are having such a hard time doing what should amount to a simple &quot;You are wrong, you are a hateful person, and you do not belong here.&quot; July&#39;s original response was fine, and it should have been left at that, and Jacer and her sockpuppets should have been flailing in the silent wilderness. <br><br>But somehow we&#39;re at each other&#39;s throats, because there&#39;s some kind of moral high horse competition going on, where people are tripping over each other to get to be the John Adams for this Boston Massacre.

            <p>Yes, Article 1 does indeed state that:<br><br>&quot;You don’t have to agree with anyone, of course, and stating your own opinion is encouraged, but no telling other people that their opinion is WRONG.&quot;<br><br>I guess I&#39;ll have to join Tray and leave, because I will not abstain from calling out a homophobe. I think this narrow interpretation ignores the spirit of the entire Constitution, though, which is meant to be inclusive and protect the PPCers from insults and wrongdoing, and also to be mature. <br><br>I consider myself a mature person with a brain, and I won&#39;t smile and nod if people spout opinions that are truly and utterly wrong.

            <p>I stayed out of this mainly because I was painfully aware that if I tried entering the discussion, I&#39;d say the wrong thing and make things worse. I didn&#39;t have the full facts, I knew nothing about Jacer, and I didn&#39;t feel that jumping in would do anything good- not to mention, I know mine is not exactly a voice that carries weight here. I&#39;m not good at situations like this, especially ones that escalate.<br><br>But having read all of this, I&#39;ve come to a decision: I too will have to leave, because people here are defending a rampant bigot and denying others their right to tell someone &#39;Your opinion hurts me and I don&#39;t want it here because it makes me feel unsafe&#39;. <br><br>If this is not remedied, how can I stay? How can I possibly remain in a place where I can&#39;t defend myself, my orientation and everyone else who supports, shares and has similar orientations against a homophobe- or against anyone else with a similarly terrible opinion? How can I stay in a place that would give Jacer another chance after she hurt Tray so much? <br><br>It&#39;s been nice, but I guess it&#39;s over now.</p>

            <p>...really, hS? Really, VM? Really, Nesh?<br><br><i>Really,</i> guys?<br><br>I can barely tell you how utterly dismayed this makes me. Honestly, I thought all three of you were better than this.<br><br>At the risk of sounding self-centered, I need to allude to something that happened in the IRC rather recently. And I need to allude to it, because it&#39;s a part of what frankly pisses me off about this.<br><br>To put it simply, July yelled at me for setting off and not shutting up about a trigger of hers relating to certain acts that will not be mentioned here. She used her right to tell me off with fairly harsh language, to the point where she basically told me &#39;you don&#39;t have the <i>right</i> to comment on X&#39;.<br><br>And frankly? In hindsight I&#39;d have to agree with her. Someone told me that I made them feel <i>used</i> during that conversation. I&#39;ll not get into specifics here, but... well, if you&#39;re feeling used, then that speaks to some kind of being really emotionally hurt, and it&#39;s hard to stay rational in a situation like that. This is <i>especially</i> so, since I was also being an uncaring, self-centered, and entirely arrogant douchebag when <i>other people</i> started calling me out on it. I should not have acted the way I did when they were telling me &#39;drop it, you&#39;re triggering stuff&#39;, and I <i>definitely</i> shouldn&#39;t have brought up the trigger in the first place. Thinking about my behavior now makes me sick, and if I could take back my behavior then I would do it in a heartbeat.<br><br>And barely <i>two months</i> after that incident, people are telling a person who is using their god-given right to call people out on their shit <i>not to use that god-given right to call people out when they say things that actually hurt them</i>?<br><br>*facepalm*<br><br>Because really, what else can I say to that?<br><br>I still think July did the right thing. And seeing Jacer&#39;s reply to July&#39;s post only convinces me further that July made the right call. And now, here&#39;s the part where I get brutally honest with certain people:<br><br>Jacer, I think you should&#39;ve left the PPC a <i>long</i> time ago. Frankly, after that thread, I wouldn&#39;t have cared if Jay Thorntree and Acacia Byrd themselves gave you permission: I would <i>never</i> have read any of your missions, I would <i>never</i> have agreed to cowrite with you, and I would have <i>refused</i> to have anything to do with you. The things you were saying were that vile. I see you haven&#39;t changed <i>one bit</i> since the LGBT thread, since you&#39;re still pulling the victim card and still being a bitch about that kind of thing. In other words, I have <i>never</i> liked you. And now, hearing that you had hurt Tray-Gnome in the way you did makes that so much worse. And that seals the deal for me: you have ensured I am never going to like you in any sense of the word ever. I don&#39;t care if you cure cancer: I&#39;m <i>never</i> going to like you. You&#39;ve essentially ruined any chance at likability you might&#39;ve had, at least from me. And from me, that says a <i>lot</i>.<br><br>And frankly, I don&#39;t <i>want</i> to be part of any organization in which Jacer&#39;s behavior is condoned in <i>any</i> way. My two month sabbatical from writing PPC missions and hanging out on the IRC was meant for me to figure out how I could improve myself for the community exactly <i>because</i> I didn&#39;t want to keep doing the same things Jacer here continues to do. It&#39;s a shame, then, that I&#39;m extending it to a permanent sabbatical because the PPC has allowed someone like Jacer to stay.<br><br>It&#39;s been a good run with the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, but this is where it ends for me.</p>

            <p>It really does show that there is a gross problem in the system when a bigot such as Jacer is defended by people.  Not just that, but when someone calls them out on it, they are smacked down.  It is only worse when the person doing the calling out has been hurt by that person, driven to the brink of suicide by their words, even moreso when they gain the courage to stand up and shout back.<br><br>Therefore, I&#39;m with Cassie and Artell as well.

            <p>Whether you like it or not, you just fell for the same thing as hS, VM, and AnnaBee. You noted outright the logical fallacy in a previous post. &quot;Bringing them up is, consciously or not, just an attempt to distract us from the actual topic of discussion, which is Jacer&#39;s behavior. That&#39;s the fallacy.&quot; Talking to someone about their behavior at some point does not mean  chastising about it in public, and certainly not after they&#39;ve exposed themselves and have made it clear <i>they do not feel safe</i>. <b>Tray has attempted to kill himself because of Jacer.</b> He has alluded to this in this very thread. <br><br>Behaving in the &#39;right manner&#39; only goes so far and can only be maintained so far, especially when the other person makes you feel cornered.

            <p>Welcome! It is a good idea to read the constitution, as well as start reading the wiki -- they&#39;re both conveniently linked to the top of the page. The Original Series is, of course, also a must :) (you can find a link to it in the wiki).<br>May I ask what are your (not disturbing) fandoms?<br>Last but not least, have a cup of refreshing green tea. Just don&#39;t let the leaves eat you.<br><br>(PS: Yes, you&#39;d better leave your sanity at the door.)</p>

            <p>Well, my not-so disturbing fandoms are:<br><br><br>-Megaman Battle Network and Starforce series<br><br>-Pokemon<br><br>-Super Mario <br><br>-Harry Potter <br><br>-Minecraft <br><br>-Super Robot Wars : I like it when mechs from diferent continuum band together and stomp evil just by working together.<br><br>-Katawa Shoujo : I know that that game is a softcore porn but I&#39;m not drawn to the porn of the game. Its the story and the character development of the game that made me like the game.<br><br><br>Well, I think that those are the fandoms that I can count off and remember as of now that I&#39;m really fond of. The other fandoms that I&#39;m fond of but not listed there can be quite disturbing for others and I wouldn&#39;t want to introduce those fandoms to you unless you feel like dying from the inside, rage on its inconsistencies, or claw your eyes out to unsee the body horrors and do the last two actions while you&#39;re at it. The only reason why I like them is because of the interesting stories and settings behind it and/or my love tearing on the waifuer&#39;s over-the-top fantasies and their bad fanfics by riffing them (feelings police be damned). <br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve read the PPC Constitution and the Original Series last six months ago. I was here before until I got really busy with my school work. Though some might not remember it, my name back then was &#39;Aile Harper&#39;. Sorry about not mentioning that in my first post. Though I&#39;m too used in being called &#39;Wodan&#39; right now that having that old name might be a bit confusing.</p>

            <p>Changing a name after absence is not necessarily frowned on. It&#39;s been done before, by people who felt badly about their initial actions, or people who wanted to change their names for whatever reason - sometimes it&#39;s more of a sign of growth.<br><br>Sock puppeting is really not a word I&#39;d like to see thrown around; she(?) told us straight-off that the name was different. That&#39;s not sock puppeting, that&#39;s changing your name and not mentioning it in the first post. Let&#39;s not jump to accusations, please.</p>
