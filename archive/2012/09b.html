            <p>Backstory: A while ago, several of the good people at That Guy With The Glasses came across a fanfic about them. And so, being the denizens of pure chaos that they are, they acted it out. Including the spelling errors.

            <p>And that <i>is</i> such a small fandom too. It needs all the help it can get, just a couple of badfics would totally overwhelm it&#39;s page at the pit of voles. <br><br>Sentences are generally off and too modern for the setting, (that&#39;s probably what you think seems off: modern colloquialisms and a lack of pacing,) but I haven&#39;t seen much there worse than the fic-thor generally just trying to set up a character that is almost exactly like the main protagonist. It&#39;s as if she thinks that female preternaturals are <i>common</i> in this world...<br><br>Still, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a direct Alexia ripoff and they haven&#39;t involved any canons yet from what I saw, so aside from  badly chosen phrasing I&#39;d call it a Meh fic for now.</p>

            <p>I... I think it might be for real. I went and looked at <a href="http://reicheru-ketsueki.deviantart.com/">the author&#39;s deviantART account</a>, and it&#39;s chock-full of terrible MS Paint-esque pictures of the OC. Also some other things, but mostly the OC. Also, the responses to comments about the story... I think it&#39;s for real. O.O<br><br>I&#39;m disappointed that LoK stands for <i>Legend of Korra</i> and not <i>Legacy of Kain</i>, though. With all the blood-drinkers running around, it would have made slightly more sense. Plus that would&#39;ve made two fandoms I&#39;m passably familiar with, and I might have claimed it, because my god is there a lot to work with in this thing. Ah well.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I considered that, but then I started reading the comments and responses on the main page. They&#39;re fairly convincing. I think the author is a little bit clueless when it comes to sarcasm (this is consistent with the tone-deafness of the fic), and doesn&#39;t seem to know what a troll is, and definitely has some unusual tastes. But that&#39;s all well within the realm of possible for a genuine author. If she&#39;s actually Japanese, as she says in her dA profile, that may explain some of the differences in style and taste, too—not enough to excuse the badness, but enough to explain how someone could come up with it at all.<br><br>Having read it all the way through now, I&#39;m reconsidering possibly claiming this. Did you notice that Alucard is in it, too? And a couple other fandoms pop up briefly, like Vocaloids. It&#39;s verging on mega-crossover territory, and for once it&#39;s almost all stuff I know something about. For the things I really don&#39;t know, like Hetalia and Vocaloids, I at least have contacts who DO know them well (you being one of them). I can spot enough that&#39;s wrong with general Avatarverse concepts to make up for not having seen LoK yet (bloodbending does NOT give you the power to bring people back from the dead), and most of the big problems would still exist even if you swapped out all the continua. Plus it might just put Nume over the edge with all the R-rated stuff, and that would be fun. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Er,</sup></sup> did you want it, though? I should ask that before I go off plotting. &gt;.&gt;;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think it probably is meant to be Goku from <i>Dragon Ball</i>, I certainly couldn&#39;t think of anyone else with that name (Wikipedia lists a couple of others, but they seem too obscure to consider).<br><br>A full description of the character would help identify him, but sadly all I could find in that regard was that he has &#39;yellow hair and builded body&#39;, which I think is supposed to be a reference to Goku in his Super Saiyan state.

            <p>You don&#39;t even have to read the whole first paragraph to realize it&#39;s pretty much an exact copy. There&#39;s the same number of names, both with a gratuitous apostrophe, the friend helping with proofreading that gets inserted into the story, even the ridiculously described eyes. It&#39;s definitely a knockoff, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t deserve attention.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know whether this topic&#39;s been brought up on this Board at all, and pardon me if it has, but I just wanted to know what the Tolkien fans on this Board think about PJ&#39;s inclusion of his very own OC elleth warrior in the Hobbit movie.<br><br>Tauriel, to me, represents the evolution of the way people perceive Tolkien&#39;s stories. LotR was written around World War Two all the way into the 50s; the Hobbit earlier than that. Historically, women fell into more traditional roles around then and so it was natural for the Hobbit to be just one big sausagefest (I recently reread the book and I don&#39;t ever remember seeing a single line by a female character in that book). Even Eowyn eventually rejects a role of a warrior for the relatively more feminine role of a healer, although she admittedly has good reasons to (-coughBlackBreathcough-). I think Tolkien&#39;s strongest female-character-in-a-male-role would be Haleth from the Silmarillion, and even she was a very minor character especially compared to Luthien (who was the wife-insert love interest of Tolkien&#39;s self-insert anyway).<br><br>So now in the 21st century, beginning with Arwen riding to Frodo&#39;s rescue and continuing here with Tauriel (played by the absolutely gorgeous Evangeline Lilly, btw), we have the films attempting to include more strong female roles in the storyline. I remember, in my earlier days in the LotR fandom, all the wank arising from &quot;ARWEN OMG, YOU SCENE STEALER, IT&#39;S BLOODY  /GLORFINDEL/&quot; and other similar sentiments, and now it seems the fandom is on the wankmobile again with &quot;TAURIEL YOU MARY SUE GTFO&quot;. Is it because of our infamous Mary Sue legacy? Perhaps. But I feel like Tauriel is being unfairly judged, especially considering most LotR Sues at least have a story to justify charges; all Tauriel ever did was show up packaged as an action figure with Legolas, and be at the centre of some rumours regarding her and Kili&#39;s relationship in the films.<br><br>What are your thoughts, then, on Tauriel? Does she represent the continuing evolution of Tolkien&#39;s legendarium, towards a more female-inclusive outlook? Or is she bad news and inadvertent encouragement for Suethors?<br></p>

            <p>With extreme prejudice so far. I did like the LOTR movies (though, how you get a trilogy out of The Hobbit other than by showing <i>all</i> of the walking or going into random flashbacks from the first war or the Silmarillarion is beyond me,) and sort of understand some of the casting decisions, just based on the marketing and not wanting more minor characters running around than there strictly needed to be. I actually thought it was kind of interesting that they actually  <i>tried</i> to show Arwen when they were in Rivendell, but that quickly became an extraneous romance shoehorned into the movie with a cattle prod. Can&#39;t Arwen and Aragorn be secure enough in their relationship and their knowledge of that what needs to be done in Middle Earth will occasionally separate them for a while? It&#39;s not like they were attached at the hip while Aragorn was walking about in the north. <br><br>All I can think about the new character Tauriel is that hey, you want to cast some women as archers in Mirkwood? Be my guest. A bow makes a lot of sense for a female warrior: for one, a short bow is not made for a large physique. The fact that she&#39;s packaged with Legolas probably says more about the actress who plays her having eye-candy status than about her actual role in the movie. I just can&#39;t think of anything - other than a throwaway line or being one of many warriors to round up the dwarves - for her to <i>do</i> in the movie. Whatever she does won&#39;t pertain to Bilbo, or to the Ring at all. And while I can accept that PJ really wants to stage Gandalf throwing down the Necromancer in order to tie this all in to LOTR on a more visible level for the audience, and elaborate more on the information that Gandalf gathered <i>before</i> the Ring was passed to Frodo, I just don&#39;t know what purpose this new role serves yet. <br><br>Also, can we, pretty please, have a movie that doesn&#39;t have a romantic subplot squeezed into it where it doesn&#39;t fit? I thought that there was certainly nothing they could do to The Hobbit in that regard, but reading the other comments, I&#39;m getting a bit worried. I&#39;m not against romantic subplots, but I wish they weren&#39;t practically <i>required</i> for multi-demographic appeal. </p>

            <p>But I don&#39;t see any problem with adding a few OCs to flesh out the story and give the gals of LotR some more roles - even if they aren&#39;t canonical gals. I&#39;m not saying I have a problem with anything in the books - because, honestly, even if I did disagree with the canon in any way, Tolkien was the author/creator and I don&#39;t feel I have any right to say &#39;NO HE DID [insert whatever] WRONG!&#39; - but it&#39;s kind of nice to see an extra girl added to the story here and there, and I think people should wait to get a more complete picture of Tauriel&#39;s character and involvement before they go off damning her or PJ to every hell that comes to mind.<br><br>(On the topic of Arwen replacing Glorfindel in the LotR movies, 1) Legolas did the same thing in the horrendous animated version, so I&#39;m really not sure why Arwen gets so much bull-poo over it and Legolas gets ignored. 2) Yes, that was annoying, but only because Glorfindel seriously needs some movie love. And an actor who doesn&#39;t look like George from BBC&#39;s Being Human.<br><br>Maybe Glorfindel will show up in the Hobbit trilogy? Since it&#39;s three movies of one book...)<br><br>TLDR Version: As long as she doesn&#39;t turn out to be a ginormous Mary-Sue who steals lines from Thranduil, I don&#39;t really have any problem with Tauriel showing up in any of the films.<br><br>And Legolas is a scene-stealer just as much as Arwen is, just not in the live-action movies. :D</p>

            <p>They can be pretty much summed up like this:<br><br>1. Who the heck is Tauriel?<br><br>2. Why is an elf warrior being made a big deal of in <i>The Hobbit</i> at all, regardless of sex? No warriors have names or speaking parts in the book that I recall, unless you count Thranduil, and he wasn&#39;t even named at the time.<br><br>3. What does Peter Jackson have against leaving well enough alone? Can&#39;t he make a pie without feeling the need to stick his fingers in it and smear it all over?<br><br><br>I&#39;m not offended by the idea of female characters doing more stuff in Middle-earth, for the record. I got over being thrown for a loop when Arwen turned up in Glorfindel&#39;s part. I get not wanting to introduce an extra role for that one thing, that&#39;s fine. (Her later appearances were mostly pointless and irritating, however.) We could&#39;ve had more of Eowyn, that would&#39;ve been awesome. No—I&#39;m offended by the idea of inserting entirely non-existent characters and/or plot points where they don&#39;t belong, to the point where the story&#39;s been stretched out to three films with uncanon nonsense—because look, really, even with the elaboration upon Gandalf&#39;s doings, it should not take three movies to tell <i>The Hobbit</i>. Seriously, if you can do <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in three, you ought to be able to do <i>The Hobbit</i> in fewer.<br><br>And wait, if all we know for sure so far about Tauriel is that she&#39;s in a toy set with Legolas, how do we even know it&#39;s a strong female role? Leggy isn&#39;t a particularly strong male role, let&#39;s not forget. For all we know, she&#39;s gratuitous eye-candy. Oh, and an excuse for more merchandise, obviously.<br><br>I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re calling an evolution of Tolkien&#39;s legendarium. The only person entitled to develop or add to Tolkien&#39;s body of works is Tolkien, and seeing as he&#39;s deceased, that&#39;s pretty much not possible. Adaptations of it are possible. Spin-offs, perhaps—you know, if PJ just wanted to tell the tale of Tauriel, Warrior Maid of Mirkwood, that could be fine on its own. The fandom and its perceptions can evolve. But Tolkien&#39;s legendarium can&#39;t evolve without its creator.<br><br>Heck, what&#39;s Legolas doing in it, for that matter? I mean, if we&#39;re just going to get a glimpse of him in Thranduil&#39;s hall, okay, he&#39;d logically be there, but surprising as this may be, I don&#39;t trust Peter Jackson that much. -_-;<br><br>... Although, there is one thing that might make me excuse Tauriel&#39;s presence. It would amuse me greatly if she turns out to be Legolas&#39; wife. Just imagine the wailing and gnashing of teeth among the fanbrats, and the exultation of movieverse agents with an all-new reason to persecute Legomance Sues with extreme prejudice. *eg*<br><br>But really, I think PJ should just write his own original story and make a movie of it, since he clearly isn&#39;t interested in making movies of Tolkien&#39;s works. He could make an all-female quest-based fantasy epic, even. Or would that have to have a Token Strong Male Character thrown in to be marketable and show that gender equality is a thing in the Real World?<br><br>... I&#39;m going to be lynched for that one. Unless, of course, I miraculously get across my point that throwing in a Token Strong Female Character where the plot doesn&#39;t call for one is pretty silly, since it isn&#39;t going to do the character or women in general any justice at all.<br><br>... Nah, I&#39;m gonna be lynched. It&#39;ll be my punishment for breaking hiatus again before I&#39;m ready, and late at night, too, when I can&#39;t keep myself from train of thought rambling that probably doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br><br>Look, I just want to watch Bilbo the Hobbit get dragged along on a Quest with a bunch of silly Dwarves and have Adventures and find a Magic Ring and save Everyone&#39;s Butts, and I know that isn&#39;t what I&#39;m going to get, because PJ already proved he can&#39;t be trusted with the LotR movies. And now I have to worry about being judged insufficiently feminist because I don&#39;t want gratuitous non-existent elf characters thrown in, too. I&#39;m not looking forward to this, you guys. {= (<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since, as noted, The Hobbit is becoming a trilogy, there&#39;s a lot of fleshing-out to be done. I&#39;ve thought over where that could happen, and there&#39;s really only a few options.<br><br>-The Woodland Kingdom is the first place the story &#39;breaks&#39; - we&#39;re told, very briefly, that Bilbo lives as an invisible thief for a while, then he finds out where the dwarves are. That /will/ need fleshing out, to make it work in film - particularly if it&#39;s three films - and that means you need to add named characters.<br><br>Remember, there are only five Mirkwood characters who even have an <i>identity</i> in the entire legendarium. There&#39;s Thranduil&#39;s father - who&#39;s dead - Thranduil himself, and Legolas. Then there&#39;s the butler and the guard from The Hobbit. No names are given in that book - at all. So yeah, people will need adding... and one thing Tolkien noted but never made very much of was the fact that, among the Eldar at least (and I know the inhabitants of Mirkwood are mostly Silvan elves, but the Eldar are all we have to go on), the differences between male and female roles are very slight. So yeah, there&#39;d be a bunch of women Doing Stuff. And I suspect this section will be <i>very</i> fleshed out, to set things up for...<br><br>-The Siege of the Mountain &amp; Battle of Five Armies. It&#39;s inevitable that the B5A will be a massive part of the final film (this is PJ, after all), and that means we want characters we know to watch. And <i>that</i> means they&#39;ll be adding people - and, given the fandom, that means elves. So the fleshed-out elves from Bilbo&#39;s stay will get a new lease in the Battle. Yes, Legolas will certainly do some trick shooting - and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see this Tauriel do the same thing. Nor, actually, would I object - someone like her would have existed, after all.<br><br>My main objection, actually, is that name. It&#39;s in the wrong language (Sindarin, not the Silvan Legolas is named in), and... well, it means &#39;Forest maiden&#39;. It&#39;s a stupid name. Almost as bad as, say, &#39;Green leaf&#39;... ohwait.<br><br>But still. With all the infinite variety of Sindarin to work with, they chose something /that/ basic? Nah. Not &#39;avin&#39; it.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I&#39;d be intrigued to know why you even /think/ PJ has an obsession with making Strong Female Characters (TM). You come back to this several times, and... er, is it based on anything more than Arwen The Horse-Thief, a named female elf, and masses of experience with fandom (of which I doubt PJ is a part)?<br><br>PPS: Lily, I&#39;m terribly disappointed in you. No, not really, but... did you /really/ think you could get away with dismissing <i>Luthien Tinuviel</i> as just &#39;the love interest&#39;? <i>Really</i>? The girl who took on (count them) the greatest Elvenking in Beleriand - who happened to be her dad - <i>two</i> sons of Feanor, <i>both</i> Dark Lords, and <i>the Doomsman of the Valar</i> - and won every time? <i>And</i> found time to pull off at least three major healings at the times she was as far from calm as she got - and, again, managed all of them? <i>Seriously?</i><br><br>(In contrast, even I have to admit that Beren was fairly useless. Um, let&#39;s see... driven out of two Elven cities and his own country, captured by Sauron (and got all his companions killed), tagged along a lot... knocked over a horse and cut a stone off a crown, that was kind of cool... nearly died (three times)... watched his dog kill a wolf... <i>did</i> die... yeah, I love the guy, but he was a bit of a disaster) ~hS</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t mean to say I think PJ is obsessed with inserting strong female characters. I was running with the premise that Tauriel is supposed to be one because Lily proposed it in her post, that&#39;s all. &#39;Course, I <i>do</i> think PJ is obsessed with &quot;improving&quot; things Because He Can, and there&#39;s at least a chance it will amount to the same thing in this case. We&#39;ll just have to wait and see.<br><br>I may also be a teensy little bit paranoid about all this, let&#39;s just make that clear before going any further. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>What you&#39;ve said makes some sense in terms of what could happen, but I don&#39;t agree that those choices are necessary to tell the story in film. For one, I wouldn&#39;t personally spend a lot of time expanding Bilbo&#39;s stay in Thranduil&#39;s halls. I can&#39;t imagine skulking around invisibly and stealing food in between wandering passageways in search of dwarves would be very riveting very long. The passage of time could be shown with a montage, or a series of short scenes. Another option would be to just speed everything up, make it take a few days instead of a few weeks. (It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if PJ took this approach; he&#39;s played a little fast and loose with timelines before.) None of these would <i>require</i> new named characters. As far as Bilbo is concerned, they&#39;re just a bunch of random elves anyway.<br><br>There is one other named Mirkwood elf, though: Galion, the guy in charge of the barrels.<br><br>Not that he&#39;s going to turn up in the Battle of Five Armies. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a special need of additional named people to watch there either, though, between Bilbo, Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Уin, Glуin, Kнli, Fнli, Ori, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Gandalf, Thranduil, Bard, Beorn, and Gwaihir. That&#39;s twenty people we will have encountered before and presumably have some stake in by the point of the battle, I hope. And there&#39;s Dбin, too, and Bolg. That&#39;s a <i>lot</i> of names to follow already. And I do expect it to be quite a spectacle, whatever else happens.<br><br>I don&#39;t expect what I think necessary to have any bearing on what actually happens, though. That&#39;s what has me worried. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh, hopefully making slightly more sense now.</p>

            <p>And yeah, I agree that it doesn&#39;t need doing to tell the story per se - but to stretch it out over three films, it probably <i>does</i>.<br><br>One thing I kind of glossed over was the Siege. Particularly, the planning sessions after Bilbo leaves the Mountain. <i>That&#39;s</i> the other part I&#39;m expecting him to expand - and most of our named cast <i>aren&#39;t</i> in that (Bard, Thranduil... Bilbo? And Gandalf-in-disguise), so it makes sense to add new ones.<br><br>And the other thing that people have sort of hinted at without saying: if Mithrandir&#39;s going to be chucking out the Lord of Werewolves, it&#39;s entirely possible she&#39;s an elf from Mirkwood or Lorien taking part in <i>that</i>. In fact, if I was desperate to keep the Hobbit-storyline as close to the book as possible, that&#39;s where I&#39;d put <i>Legolas</i>, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Is that a title of Sauron I haven&#39;t heard before (or possibly forgot)? And are there actual werewolves running around in southern Mirkwood? I have a Sue who might need to be introduced....<br><br>I could deal with Legolas and new characters down dealing with that, I think. Wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop them from being at the Battle of Five Armies, either—Gandalf gets there in lots of time, why not them?<br><br>So yes, there are ways this COULD be done well, without Tauriel being a Sue or a throwaway role.<br><br>We probably won&#39;t find out in this first film, come to think of it. Anyone know how it&#39;s being divided up? My guess would be Hobbiton to escaping the Goblins in the first film, ending on a cliffhanger with the party heading into Mirkwood and Gandalf riding off on his business in the south; the journey through Mirkwood to the Lonely Mountain and Gandalf&#39;s doings in the second, culminating with Smaug&#39;s attack; and then the third being mostly concerned with the siege and the battle. Maybe we&#39;ll get to see Bilbo take on the thieving Sackville-Bagginses at the end. That would be a fun way to crown his character arc.<br><br>Hopefully they are less than three hours long each.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... his title in the First Age. What exactly a werewolf is (it appears to be basically equivalent to &#39;Warg&#39; or &#39;Dire Wolf&#39;) and whether he picked it up again in Dol Guldur is debatable. Knowing him, I&#39;d say yes, probably.<br><br>(Actually, &#39;werewolf&#39; isn&#39;t even debatable: Carcharoth-the-Red-Maw was sired by Draugluin, who was the chief of Sauron&#39;s werewolves.

Obviously <i>Sauron</i>(/Gorthaur) could transform... but he&#39;s Sauron)<br><br>From the trailer, it looks like the rescue-by-eagle might well be the <i>very</i> end of 1. That would allow for a gentle opening on 2 (Beorn, if he&#39;s in there?), and would explain the lack of Beorn/Mirkwood shots in the trailer. I&#39;m tossing a coin on whether they end 2 with the start of the journey to the Mountain, or with the death of Smaug as you suggest. I&#39;m guessing the former, since 3 being /entirely/ B5A would be a bit much - and, with Gandalf off being busy, they&#39;ll be pressed for time otherwise.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Silmarilion says that werewolves are &#39;fell beasts inhabited by dreadful spirits that he (Sauron) had imprisoned in their bodies.&#39; (You can find this in the part about Beren being an outlaw in Dorthonion.)<br>So they seem like Dire Wolves possessed by demons (inasmuch the Tolkienverse has demons) more than anything else to me.</p>

            <p>I meant to point out that she is Edith Tolkien on a very Elvish pedestal. And she is extremely kick-ass.

You don&#39;t want an original character added where it isn&#39;t needed.<br><br>I haven&#39;t actually read the LoTR books (I couldn&#39;t get past Tolkein&#39;s writing style but I have read The Hobbit and have listened to some of a book-on-tape of The Silmarillion.) so I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about when you say that you don&#39;t trust P.J. with the movie.<br><br>I agree about how he&#39;s making it a trilogy though. From what I remember The Hobbit was relatively straight forward. In order to be three movies, there&#39;s going to have to be a lot of filler. </p>

            <p>At one point I suggested that, if inserting a token male character into an otherwise-female cast would be silly, then inserting a token female character into an otherwise-male cast should be silly, too. There&#39;s a flaw inherent in this line of thinking: namely, that our present society is not equal, so they&#39;re not quite the same beast in the cold light of reality, and my comparison seems to suggest that they are. I&#39;ve heard about people being raked over the coals for that sort of thing on this here Interweb.<br><br>Whether Tauriel <i>is</i> just a token female character remains to be seen. It&#39;ll depend on whether she&#39;s only there to look pretty and/or to go &quot;Look at me, I am girl power!&quot;, or to actually do something that makes logical, plot-relevant sense for an Elven warrior. Without, preferably, distracting from Bilbo&#39;s story.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I must admit, first off, that my immediate reaction to <i>any and all</i> changes to Tolkien&#39;s works tend to be thus:<br><br>1) &quot;They&#39;re doing WHAT?!&quot;<br>2) &quot;How DARE they?!&quot;<br>3) &quot;Ye gods and little fishes, can they NEVER let well enough alone?&quot;<br>4) *sigh.* &quot;Well, it could be worse. And this isn&#39;t all a bad trade-off, I... I guess.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m all for more female roles in fantasy - heck, all you have to do is read everything I&#39;ve said about Mary Sues in the past month here to know that - but Tolkien&#39;s work approaches something... I dunno. &#39;Sacred&#39; is probably the wrong word, but it&#39;s something very special and important, and the knowledge that there are going to be kids who think PJ&#39;s works <i>are</i> the originals/the important ones, and so the changes are worse, somehow.<br><br>Basically, it would be cool to see, as Neshomeh pointed out, The Hobbit with some of the glossed-over bits stretched out - named warriors in Mirkwood, the character development surrounding Thorin&#39;s audience with Thranduil, and yes, even The Stuff Gandalf Left To Accomplish. And I think a Tauriel would fit very nicely in such a narrative.<br><br>...but I somehow can&#39;t bring myself to that level of optimism. It&#39;s probably going to be really frustrating, and the friend I&#39;d planned to see it with made me promise in advance not to complain about the story not matching the book well enough. So... um, yeah, not entirely optimistic anymore.</p>

            <p>Really, it&#39;s Peter Jackson that scares me. I don&#39;t trust this not to be another case of Haldir at Helm&#39;s Deep: out of place, overblown, and senseless.<br><br>I mean, if he wanted Elves and Men fighting and dying side by side, he could&#39;ve done it at the Battle of the Morannon instead. That at least would carry more weight symbolically, and it wouldn&#39;t be so worrying that the elves had abandoned the defense of their own borders, because if Sauron wasn&#39;t defeated at that point there wasn&#39;t any hope left anyway. There would still be the question of how they knew to get there in time, but I dunno, maybe Gandalf arranged it?<br><br>But, yeah. Don&#39;t trust PJ.

            <p>It&#39;s all thanks to my oh-so wonderful teeny bopper friends introduced me to the latest craze in YA fiction. Oh, it is not enough to have a suethor peer review my work and it is not enough for my classmates to be enjoying Twilight: The graphic novel. No. They had to introduce me to The Tiger&#39;s Curse. Lovely. <br> I cracked open the cover to find sparkling reviews comparing the story to Twilight. That was my first clue that I was about to claw out my eyes. The story is told in first person perspective from a teenaged girl named Kelsey. Would you really expect anything less? <br>   Long story short, Kelsey holds her breath enough times in one page that you&#39;d expect she&#39;d have died by chapter four, she feels a strange attraction to a &quot;melancholic&quot; tiger, and it turns out the tiger is a prince. Awesome. That just screams quality writing, doesn&#39;t it?<br>   In any case it appeals to teen girls. This is fair warning that a large fanbase is beginning to swarm, so the PPC should be prepared. </p>

            <p>Your main problems with the story are, what, that it&#39;s narrated by a teenaged girl with abnormal lung capacity, and it&#39;s a paranormal romance?<br><br>So far, just from what you&#39;ve said, it doesn&#39;t sound terrible. Honestly, it might actually be enjoyable on some level, even if it&#39;s just because it&#39;s cheesy.<br><br>Like... The reason why people tend to get upset with bad fan-fiction is because it messes up established facts, plus bad writing. People get upset with 50 Shades and Twilight because of harmful messages plus bad writing. Bad writing alone isn&#39;t really something to get upset over, because it doesn&#39;t really hurt anyone. You can just, y&#39;know. Not read.</p>

            <p>I apologise. You&#39;re correct in that my reasons for disliking this book are primarily shallow, and I was biased from the moment the main character started angsting. Having not mustered the ability to finish another story focused on a love triangle, I have stopped reading it. I am sorry that I used the board as a medium to vent my frustrations, as it was not fair to any of the boarders. It will not happen again, I promise.</p>

            <p>Iunno about you, but I really dislike HG. Mainly because Katniss feels like a robot to me -- no emotion, no nothing -- rather like my latest Permission piece... and, to boot, the book is full of run-ons and tense-shifts (though that might be the translation) and is written in present progressive (again, might be the translation I read).</p>

            <p>Either I didn&#39;t notice that Hunger Games was written in Present Progressive (usually I cannot finish anything written in the present tense) when I read it several years ago or it was decent enough to hold my attention despite that. <br><br>If you&#39;re referring to the second half of the book about Katniss&#39; lack of emotion, I tend to think it&#39;s supposed to represent the avoidance/withdrawal stage of PTSD. <br><br>I&#39;m not wild about Hunger Games, but I don&#39;t actively dislike it. I enjoyed it when I read it, but I&#39;m unlikely to re-read or look for the sequels. My rating was &quot;above average for teenage-marketed adventure,&quot; but it not being a cheap &quot;Teenager is a spy&quot; novel probably bumped that up a bit.<br><br>Meh. They compare everything to Twilight or Harry Potter nowadays.</p>

            <p>...even though I downloaded a sample chapter of HG, just to check what you said.<br><br>1. Present progressive is stuff like &quot;I&#39;m reading.&quot; Yes, it is in present tense, but it&#39;s not suffering from ing disease. But present tense itself is not a sign for bad writing. A matter of taste, yes, but not bad writing.<br><br>2. I&#39;m beginning to suspect that it&#39;s the translation, because the writing I saw was concise and rather constantly in present tense (except for things in the past).<br><br>3. No emotion? Nah, not so sure about that. There&#39;s relief/happiness when she meets up with Gale, amusement at his accent, disappointment at her mother... again, this might be the translation not getting it across.<br><br>4. Your writing was just beige.</p>

            <p>Well, I do remember somebody saying something about no emotion in that piece. I could, of course, be mistaken. And it seems that THG&#39;s Hebrew translator needs to get a crash course in grammar -- general grammar as well as Hebrew grammar -- and in translating.</p>

            <p>You are more than welcome to create a list, and feel free to take a look at Barid and Brightbeard&#39;s missions to see what charges they&#39;ve come up with.  Honestly, though, I don&#39;t think there are many charges that would be unique to the Warcraft Universe.

            <p>Well hello there newbie! I see you have a fondness of the word &quot;awesomeness&quot;. I&#39;m still not sure if it&#39;s a real word, but it brings to mind all the Hetalia goodfic I read. Ahh goodfic... *drifts of to happy place*. You should tell me what fandoms you&#39;re interested in, maybe I could recommend some goodfic to you.<br>Since you managed to make it here, your prize is a wizard&#39;s hat*! It&#39;s conveniently labeled &quot;Wizzard&quot;, and is so unfashionable that it goes with every outfit.<br>*Warning: Wizard&#39;s hat does not allow you to perform magic. Do not attempt to perform a levitating spell while jumping off a cliff. Dry clean only.</p>

            <p>My overuse of certain words (as well as a certain tendency to speak in all caps and sentence fragments when I get excited) is a byproduct of hanging out on Tumblr more than is good for any sane person. But I was done with sanity a long time ago. It&#39;s dull. My fandoms are Sherlock, Doctor Who, Harry Potter, Supernatural, Avengers, and science. Also I&#39;m a Nerdfighter (officially defined as someone who is made of awesome and helps fight worldsuck; I am not making this up) which leads to a whole host of other quirks.</p>

            <p>My fandoms are Sherlock, Doctor Who, Supernatural, Harry Potter, Avengers, and science. For Sherlock and DW, it&#39;s the absolute craziness. For HP, the tradition. For all of them, the feels and the sense of community. I&#39;m a Nerdfighter, which is someone made of awesome who fights worldsuck. (Well, that&#39;s the official description, anyway.) I like Random Shiny Objects. Those are cool. And I freaking LOVE cookies.</p>

            <p>See, here&#39;s the thing. Yes, he&#39;s still a Stu and all his compatriots aren&#39;t much different. But they&#39;re not as bad as we all think. Let&#39;s break up Eragon and the others...<br><br> Personality-<br><br> He actually seems like a slightly above-average guy. His determination is uncommon, and likely fueled by a very un-Stu-ish trait- his foolishness. He can be a genius sometimes- he learned to read in less than a week- but these stints of increased intelligence are rare and short. Most of the time he&#39;s as dumb as a brick. How many stupid things has he done? A lot, I tell you what!<br><br> Story-<br><br> Here&#39;s where it gets bad. He&#39;s such a cliche in this respect. A guy on a quest for vengeance and then off to save the world. Falls in love with a princess and everything. And there&#39;s the over-the-top scene where he gets healed at the Blood-Oath Celebration. Yowch. He gets redemption points when the romance spends most of its time not going his way, when he screws up, and when he reacts like a normal person would in messed up situations. Sometimes, he does things just for show and admits it. He isn&#39;t exactly humble- indeed, he&#39;s proud to a fault. He has a very &quot;look-at-me&quot; attitude at times- not in the way he is written, but as a person.<br><br> Weapons-<br><br> His weapon, contrary to popular belief, is not a Sword of Sueness. Brisingr, while indeed a powerful and beautiful blade, is by no means one-of-a-kind. Every single Rider had a sword like his, made of the special metal and given its special enchantments. There are literally hundreds of swords with the same enhancements. Each one is unique in its own fashion, mind you- personally forged by Ruhon to fit a particular Rider&#39;s fighting style- but that is to be expected with such important warriors. The biggest difference between Eragon&#39;s blade and the literally hundreds of others? His lights on fire. And it was a mistake, too. See? He messed up. And then he messed up again by dropping his blade in surprise. It works to his advantage, however, making a good psychological weapon as well as burning through things made of wood.<br><br> Za&#39;roc went to Murtagh. While this blade was used for a time by Eragon, and was indeed quite a thing in comparison to those of the average enemy, it wasn&#39;t really that much better. It simply didn&#39;t need maintenance.<br><br> The falchion was definitely not a Stu weapon. It broke, for Celestia&#39;s sake!<br><br> His bows. One was very average. The other may have been a Stu-ish weapon, being a personal gift from the Elf Queen and all. But, again, he is a highly important warrior at the time.<br><br> Abilities-<br><br> Here&#39;s where the lad really loses Stu points. He is not suddenly, magically good at fighting. In fact, he sucks when he starts out and continually gets his butt kicked. He builds the skill over time, just like we in the real world would have to. His archery is good because he&#39;s been doing it for years- and for survival, at that.<br><br> His magic? It followed the same route as his swordsmanship- he started off totally incapable and worked his way up. And his magic, while a powerful tool and weapon, has its limits- he&#39;s almost killed himself with it more than once.<br><br> While he did work himself up to an extraordinary level of skill, he did so over many months and with a Hell of a lot of practice.<br><br> Now, let&#39;s look at Arya. She and the others are not so in depth, but let&#39;s see...<br><br> No redemption on her. She&#39;s so Sue we may as well call her Fernflower and turn her loose on the Marlfoxes.<br><br> Roran-<br><br> Well, he&#39;s not so bad. He&#39;s just really, really strong and a really, really good person. He fights with a hammer- what kind of Stu uses such a simple, crude, yet effective weapon? He&#39;s an average guy in terms of looks. His girlfriend- now wife- is decent, but not Sue by any means. Sure, he survived the wall, but out of necessity to the ripped-from-Star Wars- albeit well-ripped- plot. Maybe it&#39;s because he spent most of the series being a minor character, but he&#39;s not a Stu.<br><br> Nasuada-<br><br> May be a slight Sue. However, she must be an exceptional person, or she wouldn&#39;t be able to lead the Varden- she is as she is by necessity to the plot. Her relationship with Murtagh, however, loses her some serious brownie points, being very reminiscent of Bella and Edward in my eyes. She isn&#39;t perfect, though, and she definitely isn&#39;t helpless.<br><br> Elva-<br><br> Is an enigma. I&#39;m not sure whether to call her Sue. On one hand, tragic past and very adult for a 3-year-old. However, she isn&#39;t magically accepted by others- indeed, she is, as would be expected, shunned. Her illness was partially necessary to the plot and partially necessary to Eragon&#39;s angstiness later on. She also provides something interesting- a lot of ficcers want to know what happened to her in the end.<br><br> Angela-<br><br> Another I&#39;m not sure of. On one hand, her abilities are extraordinary- excessive, even. However, she is often dishonorable and tricky, both of which are un-Sue-like qualities...<br><br> Solembum-<br><br> He would be a Cute Animal Friend, but he&#39;s too vicious and sapient for that. He, too, is a trickster. He is also a member of a supposedly mythical race. He may be a Stu, but he isn&#39;t featured enough for a real determination.<br><br> Brom-<br><br> Is no Stu. He may be old and strong and wise, but have you ever met an ancient Stu who actually looked old? Brom looked well into his fifties. Sure he could be a little angsty sometimes, but that was about it. He made mistakes. He screwed up. He even spent a lot of the one book he was in lying.<br><br> Orik-<br><br> The least Stu-ish of the main characters. Orik gets drunk. He&#39;s unrefined.

            <p>You all make valid points, of course. As I said, all still huge Sues and Stus, just not as much so as we all think. I like to think that Paolini was at least trying most of the time. He did at least try to make good characters- early on, anyway. I kind of get the sense that he stopped trying about halfway through <i>Brisingr</i>. He did use a lot of deus ex machina stuff. But the series sort of started out pretty alright and then went downhill, you know?<br><br><i>Inheritance</i> (the final book) was where stuff really got bad though. That was where we got Roran taking down a city with no particular plan, Galbatorix basically creating (and Eragon surviving) a small nuclear blast, the Vault of Souls, and Arya becoming a Rider, not to mention Angela&#39;s absolutely ridiculous fighting ability.<br><br> Forgive me, but the <i>Redwall</i> series took a similar downturn towards Mr. Jacques&#39; unfortunate death. I love almost every single one of the series that I&#39;ve read up to now, but <i>Rogue Crew</i> killed me inside. I think anything written after it would be unbearable. Seriously, Skor wore tanned hides and still got called a good guy. Think what would happen if a vermin wore otter hides. Sure, the same sort of double standard exists in the real world, but that may be taking it a bit far. It&#39;s not the worst book I&#39;ve read, not by any means, but I still stand that it wasn&#39;t exactly good, although I did enjoy it. Probably more because of Razzid and the Wiltuds than anything. I hated Skor though- almost as much as I hate Fernflower. I didn&#39;t like Rake Nightfur a whole lot either. Dual-wielding claymores? Hah, no. That&#39;s about as plausible as Eragon&#39;s learning to read in a week.<br><br> Keep in mind I&#39;m still a loyal fan of the series and don&#39;t murder me or anything. The only series I haven&#39;t found fault of some kind with yet is LotR, though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s there.</p>

            <p>What gets me about the whole series is that it&#39;s so inconsistent. Eragon is a complete idiot most of the time, except for random instances of pure genius when it would be convenient for him, such as learning to read in a week. His healing ability seems to come and go as well; he cured cancer in a few minutes, but it takes him more than an hour to heal a cleft palate. Elven magic is explained in great detail, there&#39;s even a spell glossary in the back of the book, but dragon magic is hardly explained at all, and often acts like a deus ex machina. The Elves, we have all agreed, are a giant race of Sues that completely rip off Tolkien&#39;s Elves, so shouldn&#39;t the fact that Eragon is slowly turning into one be a somewhat Stuish trait? And sure, he doesn&#39;t get the girl he wants, but I seem to recall several others being interested in him. His one major physical flaw is totally erased during the aforementioned Blood-Oath celebration.<br>I have a whole &#39;nother rant for his sword, which you claim to not be a Sword of Stuness. Your first argument, that the sword was not unique, is only half true. Yes, other Dragon Riders had swords of a similar nature, but each one was a different color and was specially made for that rider. The fact that Eragon named his &quot;fire&quot; in a magical language in which words have power and didn&#39;t expect it to burst into flames is an astounding lack of logic on his part. What also gets me is the blacksmith, who belongs to a supposedly peaceful race, yet is incredibly skilled at making swords. Inheritance-verse Elves don&#39;t even use swords, so how was she able to practice? That&#39;s not the sort of thing you learn from guesswork and approximation.<br>When it comes to this series, I can&#39;t help but root for the bad guy. Galbatorix is just a cardboard cutout of a villain, and even then he hasn&#39;t really done anything wrong. I mean sure, he killed a few people, but Eragon has killed dozens more. And he really hasn&#39;t done anything bad as a ruler, if anything he made the country better. He kind of reminds me of Ventinari in that everyone hates him, but they have to admit that he does his job well.<br>- This has been a rant on the Inheritance Cycle by TheMadHatteress.</p>

            <p>I still see them all as Sues. I&#39;d just like to offer some counterpoints to your arguments:<br><br>Firstly, Eragon&#39;s name is on letter away from being &quot;dragon&quot;. Honestly.<br><br><b>Eragon&#39;s personality</b> <br><br>Foolishness seems here to replace the &quot;adorable clumsiness syndrome&quot; found in certain female Sues. <br><br><i>He can be a genius sometimes- he learned to read in less than a week- but these stints of increased intelligence are rare and short.</i> <br><br>Plot-induced intelligence, perhaps?<br><br><b>Eragon&#39;s story</b><br><br>Just one thing: <i>He gets redemption points when the romance spends most of its time not going his way[...].</i><br><br>Even if he doesn&#39;t succeed at everything doesn&#39;t subtract Sue-points away from him. The author still *has* to show us some sort of suspense/drama/struggle, ne?<br><br><b>Eragon&#39;s weapons</b><br><br>I agreed until this bit: <i>The biggest difference between Eragon&#39;s blade and the literally hundreds of others? His lights on fire.</i><br><br>Is that not the very definition of Speshul?<br><br><i>And then he messed up again by dropping his blade in surprise.</i><br><br>If I was fighting with a weapon and it suddenly decides to light itself on fire, I&#39;d drop it too. Dropping your weapon in surprise doesn&#39;t really make you less of a Sue, mate...<br><br><b>Eragon&#39;s abilities</b><br><br>He can place multiple wards on half a dozen VIPs and still not die from sudden energy drain in battle. Sure, he might have constructed the spell so that it runs on the people themselves but surely *they* do not have the stamina of an Ubercharged half-elf half-human? The energy loss would be like piling ten centimetres of plate armour on your back and running a marathon in the middle of the Sahara.<br><br>With no water.<br><br>As for the other characters...<br><br><b>Arya</b>: Completely agree.<br><br><b>Roran</b>: This is the guy who killed about 200 soldiers by himself, wrestled a Urgal to the ground, breached a city with a completely improvised plan, and armed with so much plot armour a Dalek would have trouble scratching it.<br><br>Stu.<br><br><b>Nasuada</b>: Feels off for me. Her resisting Galbatorix&#39;s attempts to undermine her sanity is sketchy, considering the king managed to break every single person he wanted to manipulate.<br><br><b>Elva</b>: Sue. A toddler suddenly as mature as an adult? Doesn&#39;t fly with me, even if magic is involved. I think a child with her powers would go mad rather than to grow up like she did. <br><br>Also needs to be disciplined. <br><br><b>Angela</b>: Speshul weapons? Check. Mysterious (read: completely unexplained) backstory? Check. Powerful influences? Check. Powerful magic user? Check. The fact that she becomes a walking plot device by the fourth book doesn&#39;t help either.<br><br><b>Solembum</b>: I don&#39;t even know, to be honest. He seems pretty okay, if not a bit plot-devicey.<br><br><b>Brom</b>: Seems decent. In my opinion, one of the more plausible characters in the story, even if he was practically a clone of Obi-Wan Kenobi. <br><br><b>Orik</b>: Agree on the fact that he&#39;s not a Stu, but I&#39;m not sure if I follow your reasoning. Being rude, alcoholic, slightly crazy, and &quot;unrefined&quot; does not automatically subtract Sueishness points. <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiSue"> Beware the Anti-Sue.</a><br><br><b>Nar Grahzvog</b>: I like this guy. Agree with you on the fact that he isn&#39;t a Sue, but once again not because he is &quot;ugly&quot; and part of the monster-turned-ally-race.<br><br><br>...aaaand that&#39;s all I have.

            <p>That all the more interesting characters are secondary. This is one of the things that immediately raises my canon Sue/Stu warning flag: that I care more about the half-developed, or undeveloped, secondary characters than the protagonist, because their struggles are a foregone conclusion and not holding my interest. <br><br>For example, Murtaugh, Nasuada, Roran and Orrin were all more interesting in books one and two, before they became main characters. After that, it seems like they got flanderized and their characterizations are less consistent.<br><br>Also, the reading, in less than a week during his teen years... that doesn&#39;t fly with me. (Everything else at least got the &quot;a wizard did it&quot; treatment: maybe if Saphira learned to read (she&#39;s mentally very young at that point, should have a brain like a sponge,) and coached him through their bond. But I expect it to take a while longer than was shown.) It&#39;s a flaw that Paolini put in, either for historical accuracy of some sort or because he wanted an extra struggle, and which quickly gets handwaved and forgotten. It&#39;s not even plot-induced intelligence, it&#39;s Paolini discovering a trait that was going to be inconvenient and killing it off as soon as was possible. <br><br>Overall, though, I find Eragon to be drop dead mediocre as a teen/YA fantasy novel. (Of course, I found Twilight drop-dead mediocre-to subpar as a teen romance novel, but I have radically lower expectations for romance novels in general and ones with pretensions to supernatural plots in particular, and did before starting.) Yeah, he&#39;s a stu. He&#39;s not a particularly entertaining stu, but he doesn&#39;t (usually) make me want to hurl vitriol. He&#39;s kind of a boring stu.</p>

            <p>Once again I request for permission.<br><br>So let&#39;s meet the agents of RC #9001. Again.<br><br>---<br><br><b>Agent #1 - Joseph Vladimir</b><br><br><b>Species:</b> Human - Homo sapien sapiens<br><br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><br><b>Age:</b> 20 (Born 29th April 1992)<br><br><b>Appearance:</b> Joseph stands at around a hundred and eight centimetres - the average height for most people his age. He possesses black hair with a fringe that hangs over his forehead, a physical trait inherited from his father. However, his eye colour takes after his mother&#39;s - a warm brown. His choice of clothing includes a long-sleeved polo shirt in the standard PPC black, along with a grey windbreaker that has the Floater Department flash patch stitched on. He also wears dark blue jeans, along with white and black sneakers.<br><br><b>Personality:</b> Joseph is a rather quiet person, preferring to wait for others to speak to him first, for he is usually too busy daydreaming or thinking. However, sometimes he does actually speak up to either remark on any strange going-ons or just communicate with shop-keepers so he can buy food.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, Joseph actually does have a sense of humour, but rarely shows it due to his quietness. The belief that he is lacking a sense of humour comes from the fact that he takes things rather literally at times, a habit he has failed to suppress over the years. His responses to jokes are rather awkward, so he has switched to merely nodding whenever someone tries to be humourous.<br><br>Joseph also possess a rather varied taste in entertainment, being able to enjoy many different genres and series, no matter how radically different from each other they may be.<br><br><b>History:</b> Joseph, as a human being that originates from the Earth of the &#39;Real World&#39;, lived a rather average life in a generic town somewhere in Victoria, Australia. Nothing out of the ordinary really happened to him during this time, the &#39;Real World&#39; being pretty much empty of anything supernatural.<br><br>Born on the 29th of April 1992, the young man of Eastern European descent went to his local secondary college in his area of Victoria, and later went to study at university. After getting recruited by the PPC however, he decided to postpone his studies, knowing that becoming an agent would take up most of his time.<br><br>He does plan on resuming his studies at a later, unknown date however.<br><br>After a year of being an agent, he now works in the Department of Floaters, for he wishes to do a variety of things in his attempt at protecting the plot continuum.<br><br><b>Weapons:</b> A Carving Knife, because it is perfectly possible to carry one around in the Real World without getting arrested, and it can be used while preparing dinner (after cleaning off the blood of Sues of course.)<br><br><b>Lust Objects:</b> Nyarlathotep from Demonbane.<br><br><b>Fandoms:</b> Anything that catches his interest.<br><br>---<br><br><b>Agent #2 - Andrew Jones</b><br><br><b>Species:</b> Human - Homo sapien sapiens<br><br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><br><b>Age:</b> 19 (Born January 4 1993)<br><br><b>Appearance:</b> Andrew is approximately a metre seventy-five in height; slightly shorter than his partner. He has messy reddish-brown hair, which is tied up into a ponytail. His eyes are a cloudy blue. His usual outfit consists of a standard PPC black t-shirt and navy blue jeans, but he is known to don a grey sweater at times. His Department of Floaters flash-patch is stitched onto the front of his t-shirt.<br><br><b>Personality:</b> Andrew possesses a rather optimistic outlook on life, and subscribes to the theory that being positive can help one get past all the hardships. Yet he is known to be sarcastic at times, especially when he is in a grumpy mood or suffering from a lack of caffeine.<br><br>The nineteen year old is rather familiar with the Laws of Narrative, having been exposed to much fiction during his life. Yet this has lead to an annoying tendency of his, for, due to being a troper, he regularly spouts out trope names to classify those fictional elements, which gets rather irritating.<br><br>He is also prone to acting in a dramatic fashion whenever he feels like doing so.<br><br><b>History:</b> Similar to his partner, Andrew was formerly a resident of the &#39;Real World&#39; until his recruitment into the PPC. Much of his activities from prior to his recruitment are unknown, due to his lack of interest in talking about his past. It can be gleaned, however, from his uncaring attitude and lack of interest in the &#39;Real World&#39;, that he found it rather boring, which could have been a reason for him leaving immediately for the PPC.<br><br>When he first began working in the PPC, he was assigned to the Janitorial Division, and spent much of his time traveling through the halls of the HQ and cleaning the halls regularly. During this time he managed to get lost many, many times, until after getting bored of such work, he petitioned for a transfer to another department/division.<br><br>This lead to him being moved over to the Department of Floaters, where he works with his current partner.<br><br><b>Weapons:</b> A long wooden stick. Possibly a broom without the fluffy thing. Good for bludgeoning things.<br><br><b>Lust Objects:</b> Sen Yarizui from Ben-To<br><br><b>Fandoms:</b> Random assortment of anime; Power Rangers; Star Trek; Star Wars; Stargate; Discworld; BIONICLE; Several fantasy and sci-fi series.<br><br>---<br><br><b>Writing Sample</b><br><br>Andrew stared blankly at the Console of Response Centre Number 9001, watching the screen glow a sickly blue. He only had a vague idea of what he was actually trying to do, which was to stare at something for a long period of time so he would grow tired and attempt to fall asleep, allowing for a badfic to be reported so he could relieve his boredom by heading off on a mission.<br><br>Yet it had only been ten minutes since he had begun this endeavour, and he still had not fallen into the arms of Morpheus. Of course, it would be illogical to believe that he could fall asleep in such a short amount of time, but his patience was wearing thin, and he really wanted something to do.<br><br>He <i>could</i> try and deal with the assortment of newspaper puzzles lying on the nearby table, but he was too lazy to actually try and finish them. They weren&#39;t really his type of thing, and suited his partner more. He was rather fearful of the fact that the amount of puzzles was increasing daily, and the pile sitting on the table was slowly getting taller and taller.<br><br>The young man hoped that his partner would actually notice the puzzles and deal with them before their Response Centre became flooded with paper.<br><br>His musings were interrupted by the appearance of his aforementioned partner, who crawled out of their closet in a sleeping bag. Joseph had decided to spend a night within the closet in to obtain some sleep, and in order to avoid getting comfortable in a bed, leading to their Console alerting them to a new mission, he had come up with the idea of sleeping in an incredibly uncomfortable fashion - standing up in a sleeping bag and lying against the back of the closet.<br><br>&quot;So,&quot; remarked Andrew as he turned to face his partner. &quot;How was your night?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Neck hurts,&quot; was the reply from the other man.<br><br>&quot;Well at least you managed to get some sleep. I can barely survive on instant coffee. Oh yeah, we&#39;re running out. Could you go get some more? Or even buy us a coffee machine?&quot;<br><br>Joseph shook his head, and continued to shuffle along the floor in the sleeping bag towards his destination: the small fridge that lay nestled away in the opposite corner of the response centre from the closet. It was a rather strange sight, seeing a young man crawl determinedly across the generic floor, never giving up on his goal no matter how difficult it may be.<br><br>&quot;You could just get out of the sleeping bag and walk to the fridge you know,&quot; Andrew said, an amused tone present in his words. &quot;It isn&#39;t very difficult.&quot;<br><br>His friend turned to stare at him, before resuming the journey to the fridge.<br><br>&quot;Seriously man. You should really get off the floor. It isn&#39;t healthy.&quot;<br><br>A sigh arose from Joseph, who reluctantly pulled himself out of the sleeping bag, before slowly getting back on his feet. He yawned as he craned his neck to the right, as well as stretching out his arms.<br><br>&quot;Closet is very uncomfortable,&quot; he muttered, stating the obvious. &quot;I believe I should try the floor instead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well have fun with your attempts at having a good night&#39;s sleep,&quot; groaned his partner, moving away from the console, &quot;because I&#39;m off to get myself some coffee.&quot;<br><br>With those words, Andrew strode to the door of the response centre, pulled it open and promptly marched out into the hallway in search for the glorious drink of the gods - coffee, leaving Joseph alone within the rather bland room.<br><br>He shook his head once more, and headed off towards the fridge, which he reached with ease now that he was walking instead of shuffling across the floor like a worm. Opening it up, the nineteen year old rummaged around for a bit, before finally obtaining his prize: a bottle of iced tea. Triumphant, he closed the small door of the fridge, and walked over to the table where the puzzles sat on, pulling back a chair and sitting down.<br><br>With the lack of missions, pretty much the only way to pass the time was to finish the large stack of puzzles on their table. He had no problem with it, for to him, what could be better at helping pass the time that solving newspaper puzzles while drinking iced tea?<br><br>Pulling out a pen from his pocket, Joseph took the puzzle on the top of the pile and began to write down answers.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read over the sample and characters, and I think that hS is correct that there is something a bit off in the sample.  It seems to me the sample is a bit too formal, but that isn&#39;t quite right.  It is hard to put a finger on.  That said, I don&#39;t want to make a decision just yet.<br><br>I&#39;ve read the discussion on this thread and I consulted with a third PG and here is what I propose: email me the link or file to something else that you&#39;ve already written.  It doesn&#39;t have to be PPC related, or even funny (though a funny piece wouldn&#39;t hurt).  I will give it a read over and, based on that, make a decision on permission.

            <p>I like it. Your characters seem solid enough, and will only become more developed as they go along.<br><br>The only thing that I recommend though, is that when you switch PoVs, write like your characters think. They both read like they think the same way, which doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, considering that they&#39;re two different characters.<br><br>So, in short, good job, and keep improving.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re characters sounded interesting. And I liked your overall writing style. Different stokes for different folk? Like how some stories are written as if they are quite serious, while other Lemony narrators. Nothing wrong with that. </p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve noticed, some of your descriptions seem to be a little &#39;Department of Redundancy Department&#39;.  For example: &quot;He possesses black hair with a fringe that hangs over his forehead, a physical trait inherited from his father.&quot;  Mentioning that hair color/style is a *physical* trait seems a little redundant to me, and there are several other examples of such things.<br>Also, most of your writing seems to be missing the odd comma from place to place.<br>That is all.  Hope you don&#39;t take this offensively, I&#39;m just trying to give concrit.</p>

            <p><br>On the Agents: I have no particular problems with Joseph, although I find myself wondering how consistant his personality is. You peg him as distracted, quiet, literalist, and easily entertained - which don&#39;t necessarily contradict each other, but have the capacity to do so. Your sample takes that &#39;literal&#39; in a humorous direction - which is essential, naturally - and also introduces what seems to be an accent (&#39;Closet is very uncomfortable&#39; is syntactically wrong in English, but sounds a lot like what Eastern European English speakers often use). Is that right? And if so, is it modelled on a real person, or just a stereotype?<br><br>Andrew gives me rather more worries. Two specific things caught my eye. First, this habit of spouting tropes - while very realistic - has a possibility of becoming incredibly boring to read. A mission where Andrew spouts cliches and Joseph nods silently to them would not be fun - and it&#39;s the sort of easy-writing trap one might fall into. On the flip side, you didn&#39;t in your sample, so that&#39;s promising.<br><br>The other query I have is over his transfer. You say he &#39;managed to get lost many, many times&#39;. In PPC HQ, this strongly implies that he was incredibly focussed on his job - ie, that he thought too hard about where he was going (&#39;It&#39;s a bit of a maze, unless you hadn&#39;t noticed&#39;). On the flip side, you say &#39;getting bored&#39;, and your sample takes this and runs with it - he tries to force a mission to manifest because he&#39;s bored, but gets bored of trying, and is also too lazy/easily bored to do the newspaper puzzles. That sounds more like someone who a) wouldn&#39;t do well in Janitorial (which fits the profile well), but also b) would actually get where he&#39;s going distressingly easily in HQ. Is there something I&#39;m missing, or is that something you didn&#39;t consider?<br><br>On the sample: On the technical side, you have a few hiccoughs in punctuation - &#39;Well at least&#39; would use a comma, for instance, as would &#39;Well have fun&#39; - and paragraphing - which, I can&#39;t peg anything as actually <i>wrong</i>, but you have an awful lot of paragraphs for the narrative sections. My standard paragraphs are probably twice as long as yours. You also have one factual error (you peg Joseph as nineteen in the third-to-last paragraph, but 20 in his bio), but that&#39;s pretty clearly just a mistake, which occasionally happen. :P<br><br>My main concern is that the narration just feels that little bit off. For instance, your very first paragraph. &#39;Watching the screen glow a sickly blue&#39; would probably sound more natural as &#39;watching the sickly blue glow of the screen&#39;, and your second sentence just sort of... keeps going. Again, it&#39;s not <i>wrong</i>, it just sounds strange to me. (Actually, it makes me wonder if English is your first language, because it sort of feels like a slightly different language structure is injecting itself in there).<br><br>I just don&#39;t know. I like what happened in your sample - the idea of trying to trick the Laws of Narrative Comedy into giving you a mission is a good one, and Joseph&#39;s literalist &#39;I am in my sleeping bag; it is warm; I will stay in my sleeping bag and do things this way&#39; is funny. You portray their characters well - particularly Andrew&#39;s boredom, but Joseph&#39;s quietness comes across well too - but the actual writing just comes in at slightly the wrong angle for my brain. I don&#39;t know.<br><br>So I&#39;m going to defer judgement. Sorry; hopefully someone else with a fancy hat like mine will show up and tell me I&#39;m talking rubbish, but since I can&#39;t pin down <i>what&#39;s</i> bothering me, I don&#39;t want to make a decision - particularly if it turns out to be something you can fix once alerted.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Since, you know, all we&#39;ve been hearing from BBC Sherlock on this board are badfics, I might as well rec a goodfic that was finished today.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7841502/1/Glimpse-of-Gold">Glimpse of Gold</a> by TheOtherMaddHatter. Rated T.<br>All right, if you&#39;re not into AU it might not be your cup of tea, but this is Sherlock in a Pirates of the Caribbean-esque setting. Sherlock as a pirate, essentially. And he forms a bond with a merman he calls John. <br>The plot is fantastic; there are some really intense scenes, and I mean intense as in battling and pirating and stuff. If you&#39;re not into graphic violence and cannibalism (these mermaids are bloody vicious, I tell you), this fic may also not be your cup of tea.<br>But for the rest of us, I highly recommend this fic for the emotional manipulation and vivid detail, as well as the excellent characterisation.</p>

            <p>I may be overreacting as such (and is it even in topic or should be OT?), but this caught my attention and won&#39;t leave me, so I have to blabber about it everywhere.<br><br><br>As I was watching Heartbeat today (lovely series, really), I became very puzzled when I saw TARDIS. That&#39;s right, a TARDIS. Well, the episode WAS about messing with people&#39;s minds, and David is known for being silly, but... let me explain what happened.<br><br>David went to work on a construction site that he had to clean up. A police box was standing in the mess, so he decided to take this first and loaded it onto his car/truck/lorry/thing and then went to have lunch break. When he returned, it had disappeared. Very well. But after he had taken off a bunch of things and came back for second load, it was back, in the middle of the mess.<br>The series, as some may know, takes place at sixties or so when police boxes were common, but I don&#39;t think somebody would just leave one in a pile of construction junk. And normal ones don&#39;t disappear either.<br><br>We don&#39;t see it again in the episode (except by mentioning that David has been seeing police boxes), but it was already stuck in my head. TARDIS. In Heartbeat. An episode filmed in 2003 about some British small town in 1960s or so.<br><br><br>So... Am I overreacting as a newbie Whovian or did BBC actually play a trick on us the audience by creating a canon crossover? :)</p>

            <p>(I agree that that sounds like a sneaky crossover... and, remember, <i>An Unearthly Child</i> started off way back in &#39;63 with the TARDIS in a junkyard... but I&#39;m going to take your thread and run away a bit with it)<br><br>I&#39;ve always thought that there should be more of these types of crossovers in shows that merit it. The one I would desperately love to see is a <i>Marple</i> story where the little old lady goes about her business, and there&#39;s a murder, and the police show up... led by Chief Inspector Japp. And then there&#39;s a knock at the door and this funny little Belgian man shows up... (But of course that would require way too many things to happen, including the writing of a non-Christie story for those two series&#39;, so ah well)<br><br>I&#39;m also convinced, slipping into British young-children&#39;s television, that Rosie from <i>Rosie and Jim</i> (very old show now, about the titular two ragdolls on a canal boat) has moved on and is now the star of <i>Everything&#39;s Rosie</i> (still with ragdoll hair attached by a button)... but they&#39;re on totally different channels and <i>surely</i> no TV producer could get away with that...?<br><br>And, less canonically, it&#39;s always amusing when actors show up in other shows of the same type. I remember one episode of (the murder mystery) <i>Morse</i> where the culprit turned out to be the star of (the murder mystery) <i>Inspector Linley</i>... looking, of course, exactly the same, since his own show post-dates the <i>Morse</i> episode.<br><br>Point? No point here, just ramble.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know much about some British shows like <i>Rosie and Jim</i> (but I think I&#39;ve heard of <i>An Unearthly Child</i>) - I consider myself somewhat British-obsessed, but am still a bit far from wider knowledge.<br><br>But oh, this! Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot! Dear, I want this to happen so much. Maybe I could borrow TARDIS and go convince Agatha Christie write a legal crossover book where they meet... *goes around rambling about murder mystery vs fantasy/scifi mix-ups*<br><br>Morse and Linley reminded me of how in <i>Kommissar Rex</i>, one actor played a small villain in the early episodes, and some seasons later became Rex&#39;s partner. With a different character of course, but it was enough to cause a bunchload of cheering and speculation and suspicion and fangirl squeals.</p>

            <p>That Benedict Cumberbatch, star of BBC Sherlock, was in an episode of Marple? <br>And in his radio series Cabin Pressure, he said the &quot;eliminating the impossible&quot; line as well. He didn&#39;t want to be called Sherlock Holmes on Cabin Pressure, so they called him Miss Marple instead.<br>(Okay, that could just be me and too much time with Ben&#39;s work, yeah)<br><br>Another freaky Sherlock actor coincidence is how the actor for Sebastian Wilkes in the Blind Banker actually played a university classmate of Benedict&#39;s in... Hawking, I believe, and he quipped in BLIN that he and Sherlock were at university together. (That&#39;s more continuity than a single episode of Glee.)<br><br>And actually, Wholock has happened in tie-in book form, where the Doctor consulted ACD!Sherlock Holmes. Professor Challenger may or may not have made an appearance (or that could be another Holmesian, er, expanded universe book).<br></p>

            <p>Like I say, children&#39;s TV from at least 20 years ago - possibly twice that, if the ones I watched were reruns. (Unearthly Child, of course, is the first episode ever of Doctor Who - my inconsistant italicisation may have obscured that).<br><br>It <i>should</i> happen! And there&#39;s no reason they <i>can&#39;t</i> shoehorn one into the other - I&#39;m pretty sure a bunch of <i>Poirot</i> episodes had Hastings thrown in where he wasn&#39;t - and I actually recall one non-Poirot Christie book having <i>him</i> shoved in...<br><br>It&#39;s the sort of thing that used to happen quite a lot before the Internet. Probably the most surreal example is the Gallifreyan policeman somewhere in the Fifth Doctor&#39;s era... who was played by Colin Baker, the Sixth Doctor. Watching Six shoving Five in prison was <i>really weird</i>... but probably no-one even noticed at the time (well, you know what I mean :P)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Henry Gale crashed on the island in a weather balloon sponsered by Nozz-A-La Cola, a company from Stephen King&#39;s <i>Dark Tower</i> novels.  Since <i>The Dark Tower</i> uses inter-world travel as a heavy theme, the implication seems to be that Gale lifted off in a version of Earth closish to the Dark Tower and found an aerial version of the highways in hiding (which connect alternate universes).  He then wound up in the <i>Lost</i> universe, crashed on the island, and either died in the crash or was killed by Ben Linus.</p>

            <pre><code>     A certain Sherlock/Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide crossover fic has caught my attention. So far it is only one chapter in length, but I&#39;m keeping an eye on it. It has the potential to turn into a rather large mess. &lt;br&gt;          The grammar is almost passable at moments, but a great deal of it turns into this: &quot;You have no information except that last you heard he was in London? Lost contact for at least three year. Well it&#39;s better than anything I heard all week but first we must wait for John to show. He has two minutes judging by the last time this happened.&quot;&lt;br&gt;         Then there is the matter of Trillian being renamed Zooey, and having the unfortunate occupation of: &quot;actress, fashion icon and superstar.&quot;&lt;br&gt;     I&#39;m thinking of posting a short review with con. criticism. Should I wait for it to spiral downwards before officially reporting it, or drop the link here for reference? I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a procedure for this.

So, apparently after the Jail Scaglietti incident, the TSAB decides, in order to protect the galaxy from a threat that isn&#39;t there, to lift the ban on mass-based weaponry (one of the biggest taboos, and completely unnecessary since magical weapons are safer, more controllable, and better in general), release the guy who held the ENTIRE CAPITAL PLANET hostage, and let him continue his combat cyborg work. Only Nanoha and the Saint King church, apparently, oppose this. Not Fate, who HOME RUN&#39;d Jail into a wall, not Subaru, who IS a combat cyborg whose sister was BRAINWASHED into serving Jail, and who idolizes Nanoha, and not Hayate, who is pretty much the adopted sister of the Church&#39;s head. And after this, Nanoha is apparently killed after being hit with a ton of Arc-en-Ciels, yet something called a &#39;Forerunner&#39; revives her, gives her a speshul makeover (she gets heterochromia [is she now a descendant of the Shutran Hegemon now?], white hair, a seventeen-year-old body, and loses the &#39;hair on her more private areas of her body&#39;.)

            <p>...is that--in my mind--you can write a lot more about life in HQ with the agents. Since Intel is an infrastructure department, you can get a sort of &quot;nine-to-five&quot; feel out of it since surveillance work isn&#39;t always as hectic as the life of an Action agent.<br><br>It&#39;s quite fun being the only person who writes for the DoI, but the other half of the fun is seeing how others use your ideas in their spinoffs.<br><br>Speaking of which, is it just me or am I noticing people mention Intel reports a lot more in recent missions? </p>

            <p>And yes, I mean in pretty much every Infrastructure department (except for FIcPsych and Medical.) The character is supposed to be a person with a bunch of bodies--they&#39;re all identical, and she controls each one, sort of thing. Thing is, the agent doesn&#39;t get any of the normal advantages to being in multiple places at once--she can&#39;t make them appear or disappear, and she has almost no physical endurance or strength. So she does Infrastructure. </p>

            <p>Okay, let me just... um...<br><br>Um.<br><br>Repeat after me. Out loud, if you can.<br><br><i>There are no PPC Higher Ups.</i><br><br>None! We are a community of equals. Authority exists only where utterly impossible to avoid - in the case of Permission Givers, we really have no authority outside of giving permission. The Nameless Admin is nameless specifically to avoid giving their word weight in conversations outside of technical issues. On the IRC, the DAs&#39; authority exists only to stop things getting out of hand, and the mods/admins/whatever-they&#39;re-called only exist to deal with trolls and Serious Problems. Sometimes, having been around a bit longer means people listen to you more (see: the Huinesoron Effect), but that&#39;s an illusion, more or less, entirely due to the level that people ...well, listen to you more. Someone who&#39;s been around for six months and done a ton of hands-on work with the Wiki has more pull concerning the Wiki than does someone who&#39;s been around for seven years and only ever touched it with a ten-foot pole.<br><br>So, you see, putting a thread on the &#39;Board and hoping that some authority figure will come start a Thing is a futile hope - you&#39;re only going to get crazy Bogdanovists like me to tell you the Vor system is an illusion, or people like hS to wave their arms frantically and go &quot;I&#39;m not in charge! Stop looking at me!&quot;<br><br>If you think a change should be made, this is exactly(-ish) the way to go about it. Either 1) create the article yourself, and then, through the wiki page* or the &#39;Board, let people know about it, and ask for help and contributions and/or opinions. Or 2) ask people about what they think about creating said wiki page.<br><br>And, <i>voila</i>! The page is officially created. It&#39;s much better than a bureaucracy, don&#39;t you think?<br><br>(You may also have created a new secret identity for me, for which I must thank you. Next time, somebody just wave the Bogdanovist Spotlight around.)<br><br>*probably recommended, since that&#39;s where the Wiki-Involved People will definitely see it - on the &#39;Board, you&#39;re getting the Board side of the Triple Venn Diagram** of PPCers, on the Wiki, you&#39;re getting the Wiki side. Which is what you want, for New Article Teams.<br><br>**Three overlapping circles - the &#39;Board community, the IRC community, and the Wiki community. Sorta. But I think they make a bit more sense in an extra dimension, since you get people who are Wiki-and-IRC but don&#39;t check the &#39;Board, and people who&#39;re &#39;Board-and-IRC but don&#39;t touch the Wiki, and people who&#39;re Wiki-and-Board but never bother with the IRC. And people who do all three, and people who do just one, though that&#39;s discouraged (especially for the Wiki).</p>

            <p>Oh dear, brace yourselves.   <br>The modern version of Sherlock Holmes can be very mercurial. He tends to go with what comes naturally to him. In most cases this means he is blunt, condescending, and unable to understand the sensitivity of other&#39;s. He is willing to show off for anyone, and shows many traits similar to those with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome; however, these are exaggerated for entertainment purposes. He shows less compassion than even the original character, and refers to himself as a highly functioning sociopath. This does not seem to fit his psychological profile, so we&#39;ll chalk that up to his many years of being called a freak. He tends to tell people to shut up when they aren&#39;t talking, derive enjoyment from petty revenge, and act like a prodigal six year old. All of this is an integral part of his personality, and yet many fangirls idolise him anyway. Subsequently, many get it into their heads that their Mary Sues can change him for he better. <br>This has been a rant on the characterisation of BBC universe&#39;s Sherlock. Have a nice day, and please do take our complimentary bag of peanuts. </p>

            <p>Yeah, the Aspergers symptoms are a bit overplayed (usually) but I always read that as him being more outrageous than usual  so that he wouldn&#39;t be ordinary. Most people learn coping mechanisms: he seems to be avoiding that.<br><br>And the Mary Sues are stupid, because if he wanted to change, he would have done it for a)John b)His family or Mrs Hudson c) Lestrade so that he would be more welcome at Scotland Yard. So clearly, his current lack of connectivity to the ordinary people of London is not of any concern to him.<br><br>This has been a complimentary rant. Pass the peanuts.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m just going to say that the majority of Sherlock Sues I&#39;ve seen (and I have seen a shitload of them now) function under the idea that &quot;girls want a bad boy who&#39;s willing to be good for them&quot;, under the appeal of Boyce Avenue&#39;s cover of Katy Perry&#39;s &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; (instead of being all about sex, the BA cover is all about cuddling around and having deep romantic connections. yeah. it&#39;s very nice).<br><br>That is to say, any bad boy like Sherlock or Moriarty (and by bad I mean cynical about society, possible sociopathy, etc) can be turned into a loving, caring ideal mate of the Sue&#39;s at the cost of believable characterisation. Because, believe me, there is a way to write lovey-dovey Moriarty and it&#39;s &quot;as a psychopathic act&quot;. And there is a way to write a caring Sherlock and it&#39;s &quot;Three Garridebs, with Watson being hurt&quot;. <br><br>Key term: Watson. Because to me, any Sue who attempts to be with Sherlock Holmes is upstaging John Watson. Even if John is straight and Sherlock is asexual (popular headcanon, especially given the married-to-his-work spiel), there is still an element of their bromance that goes deeper than such. Neither can exist without the other - their post-FALL characterisations in the last minutes of the show clearly say that. John&#39;s entire dating career has been trainwrecked by Sherlock, and Sherlock is entirely uninterested in something as vapid as dating girls. <br><br>So if a Sue tries to change that, they change a huge part of Sherlock&#39;s character.<br><br>(Pardon my heteronormative language, but we /are/ discussing Suvian stereotypes in the BBC Sherlock fandom and heteronormativity tends to happen with Sues around.)</p>

            <p>I dunno if this is the case with the BBC Sherlock, but I know that in the original Conan Doyle work, the only woman Holmes ever cared about was the one from &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia.&quot;  And the only reason he cared about her was purely professional admiration; she was the only person ever to &quot;beat&quot; him.<br><br>TL;DR, Holmes doesn&#39;t give a rip about any woman who can&#39;t beat him at his own game.</p>

            <p>(Spoilers like woah below)<br>In BBC, Sherlock only beats Irene after Mycroft hands it over to him on a silver platter that he&#39;s been duped. It&#39;s a twist stolen right from the <i>Private Life of Sherlock Holmes</i>. And while fandom may cry sexist for Sherlock saving Irene at the very end, I personally think he was returning the favour -  she did save him and John at the beginning of the episode, at the pool.<br><br>The only other female figure that Sherlock is shown to care about (in whatever way he shows that care) is Mrs Hudson. She&#39;s the only one who gets to hug him onscreen without repercussions. All the other female characters he belittles, and while he does tell Molly Hooper (who has a huge crush on him) that she matters to him, it&#39;s also in light of him needing a favour from her so I doubt that it was wholly genuine.<br><br>TL;DR: There are only three friends in BBC Sherlock&#39;s circle, and they are Mrs H, John, and Lestrade. And two out of three of those friends he constantly insults and belittles. Finding the space to care about a female love interest will burst his little heart. :&#39;D</p>

            <p>And Sherlock&#39;s not even in love with her; he just respects her because she&#39;s the mathematician who created a keycode that Moriarty had been after in the Reichenbach Fall. It&#39;s the whole genius-respects-genius thing, and the fic centres on their destroying all traces of this keycode (it&#39;s a fill-in-the-Great-Hiatus fic) to make sure Moriarty&#39;s network don&#39;t get their fingers on it again.<br><br>The author says it&#39;ll be Sherlock/OC, but so far there&#39;s no romance and I wouldn&#39;t be averse to seeing it later on, because Sherlock is extremely believable in this fic.<br><br>More tl;dr: It takes a hell lot of writing skills to make him give a shit about an OC without being OOC, and the vast majority of OC writers Do It Wrong.</p>

            <p>Hello, all!<br><br>You may (read: probably don&#39;t) remember me; I was around for a little while a year or two ago.

So, I put on my bathrobe, broke out my grandda&#39;s pipe, and started re-reading bloody everything.  I&#39;m not through yet - not by a long shot - but I think I may try my hand at writing for the PPC once again.<br><br>In short: Get your Bleeprin ready, and pray that my computer&#39;s Machine-Spirit is willing to let me use spellcheck (Omnissiah knows I used enough holy engine oil to  lubricate a battle tank, much less a laptop), because Riese is back in all of his unhinged glory.<br><br>Seriously, I love you guys way too much to stay away, and I love writing stuff like this too much to not at least try again.

            <p>And just in case you don&#39;t know about it yet, those CDs are hosted at various places online.

            <p>Oh, and - brilliant thing about [i]Fury[i] is that it&#39;s quite impossible to start mid-series, because there&#39;s on;y one book.  It isn&#39;t Honorverse, but it&#39;s excellent.

And to go with them, here&#39;s a bag of s or <sup>s</sup> - or even vs in a pinch.<br><br>I&#39;ve always loved the sort of long-series authors who occasionally write standalone books. The other one that springs to mind is David &amp; Leigh Eddings - it takes ages and ages to get through the <i>Belgariad-Mallorean(-BtS-PtS...)</i>, but if you want a &#39;quick&#39; (for high fantasy) fix, <i>Redemption of Althalus</i> is right there on the shelf.<br><br>I suppose the same thing could be said for Terry Pratchett - or the Star Wars EU - but those books tend to work by themselves anyway, so it&#39;s a bit different. I suppose it&#39;s what Christopher Tolkien was trying to do with <i>Children of Hurin</i>, too... but I have a fanatic dislike for Turin, so that one didn&#39;t really swing me. :P<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m kind of mixed about one-shots, honestly.  A lot of them are good, and good just being a standalone.  But occasionally, they leave me wanting more.

            <p>Welcome a-Board, newbie. Please leave your sanity in the bin by the door, as you won&#39;t be needing it here. Along with LotR, which you mentioned, Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia are both relatively popular here, so you won&#39;t be alone.

            <p>Wow, lots of people! :D I feel so loved! Anyway, I love animals of all shapes and sizes, though particularly the fluffy/fuzzy/cuddly/fluzzly ones. Cats and dogs in particular. And I&#39;m a girl. You guys can call me meow... Though Mysterious Somebody from the darkest depths of Original Characterland works too. Up to you. <br><br>I&#39;m a big reader, so I would have to choose a book fandom... Gods, so much to choose from... Ah, Well, I would have to pick Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia. This is always subject to change, of course (Gone with the Wind was MAGNIFICENT and I&#39;ve just started in on LOTR, which seems to be a big favorite around here...). As for TV, I would go with my favorite show, Criminal Minds. No, I&#39;m not a crazy obsessive Reid fangirl... Or, at least I&#39;m not crazy and obsessive... ;)<br><br>I read all the Constitution and stuff, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be good... Well, I&#39;ll try. Just kidding! Or am I?<br><br>I&#39;m a pretty terrible writer, or at least in my view; too much dialogue, not enough description. But I may write when I&#39;m better, just so that I can send a 5&#39;3 ginger girl with glasses and a knife after Mary Sues. Fun!</p>

            <p>A Lust-Object is strictly a character that the person finds attractive. A favorite can be anything or anyone that the person likes. For example, a character could be in love with Harry Potter, making him their Lust-Object but could also find Hermione a nice person who they would like to be friends with and not attractive, making Hermione one of their favorites. Favorites also works with objects; say a character collects spoons, then spoons would be a favorite of theirs.</p>

            <p>It actually seems pretty decent so far, given that the author&#39;s note is about trying to give the game historical accuracy. My (admittedly not extensive) knowledge of Spanish grammar and syntax is actually fairly happy while I read this. <br><br>Also, I&#39;ve seen a lot of spanish fics, and usually (If I can read them) they seem like they&#39;ve been put together with more caution than the English ones. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just the law of averages (smaller sample size = less badfic) or if people who live in primarily spanish-speaking areas simply just bother to read their work before submitting. And, keep in mind, that the concept of a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily translate across cultures - sure, there will be flat, badly written OC&#39;s, but I wouldn&#39;t relish trying to explain the concept in a foreign language. <br><br>Best way to find Spanish and French fic is to go to the just in page for your particular fandom. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a Spanish language version of the site that has it&#39;s own address and more Spanish fic, but now I&#39;m intrigued. I always thought it was just that there were less people who chose to write fanfic in Spanish or French if they could possibly write it in English. (Between there and Fictionpress, the most common complaint I hear when someone who doesn&#39;t speak or write english fluently is notified of a mistake is that &quot;English isn&#39;t my first language, and no one would ever have read it if I wrote it in my first language.&quot;)</p>

            <p>In fact, I am writing my fanfiction, IrregularS, in English as there wouldn&#39;t be much audience for it in my native language. There IS an Italian fanfiction site called EFP with both a Madoka and a Nanoha section, but there aren&#39;t a lot of stories on it (about ten for Madoka, and nearly all HomuMado shipfics) and the average quality isn&#39;t better than FF.net.<br>Besides, I wouldn&#39;t be able to share it with the other Madoka and Nanoha fans here, which would have been a shame.<br><br>Hell, I actually am writing my PPC missions in a language which is not my own, putting a lot of effort into making my grammar good, so I think that using &quot;I&#39;m not English&quot; as an excuse for shoddy grammar without making efforts to improve it is a proof of Just.Not.Bothering.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I couldn&#39;t tell the difference before I knew this, so you&#39;re doing awfully good so far. I agree on the site thing, but I also think that the reason that there are so few non-english fics floating out there is <i>because</i> people feel like they won&#39;t have an audience if they don&#39;t write in English. It&#39;s kind of a vicious cycle. <br><br>I&#39;ve always wanted to learn Italian, but there&#39;s only so many languages I can cram into my school career. I agree on the not bothering bit: if you&#39;re not fluent and don&#39;t care to try to type as fluently as possible, then you&#39;re writing in the wrong language and should probably stop and do something you care enough about to put more work into. I mean, clearly there&#39;s pressure to produce work in English even if you&#39;re not very good at English, but it&#39;s one thing to say &quot;forgive me for a couple grammar mistakes, I&#39;m still learning,&quot; and another entirely to say &quot;Don&#39;t criticize my grammar, I don&#39;t speak this language!&quot;</p>

            <p>I have another tiny little question. -ducks behind couch-<br><br>-peeks, then comes back out-<br><br>Anyway, since I&#39;ll be asking for permission sometime this month, I was wondering about RC numbers.

Also, is the RC layout up to me, or is that determined by who/whatever gives me the RC number?<br><br>And is peanut butter really brown, or is it more of a dusty orange?</p>

            <p>The choosing of the number is up to you - as long as nobody else is already using it, you can use whatever you want.<br><br>The requesting metod isn&#39;t exactly &quot;rigid&quot;: it used to be asking on the Livejournal list, but now adding directly to the one on the Wiki seems fine too. (I requested my only one back when we used the LJ one as &quot;official&quot;, so I&#39;m not exactly 100% sure)<br><br>The layout is entirely up to you. An empty room? Fine. A small, cluttered loft?

            <p>You can have any RC that&#39;s not taken. Just say it&#39;s your agents&#39; RC in your spinoff, and it&#39;s yours. As for layout, that&#39;s up to you. We really don&#39;t have a set layout other than N places to sleep, a bathroom, a console, and somewhere to put things, like drawers or closets. Anything after that is up to you.</p>

            <p>You have four threads now, more than anyone else--and you&#39;ve already been warned about this. Consider this your second warning. You won&#39;t get a third, so please pay attention.<br><br>I know you&#39;re excited to be here, and we&#39;re glad to have you. But the Board is already so active right now that it&#39;s easy to bump someone else&#39;s post, especially a mission report that a Boarder has worked really hard to bring to the table, off the main page.  Added to the fact that your post once again contains &quot;No Subject&quot;, this seems to point to you being, shall we say, a bit trigger-happy with the posting.  That is, you seem to have a tendency to post in the heat of the moment, as soon as you&#39;ve found something shiny and new.<br><br>We PPCers understand this impulse, believe me--but if we posted every time we came across something we thought was unusual (&quot;Huh, look, a kind of Suefic we&#39;ve never seen before!&quot;) the Board would get very cluttered very fast. Self-editing is one of the most important skills we possess, and I urge you to employ it.<br><br>~Araeph<br></p>

            <p>There&#39;s a link somewhere at the top of the &#39;Board, and unless you post several times per second or actively shut down/talk over people, nobody objects to lots of conversation.

            <p>Think of it as PPC-time, where time is measured by number of posts per page, as opposed to real time, measured by the standard minutes and hours.

            <p>...And some newbies too. <br><br>Howdy all. Name&#39;s Saphie. The Suedom Saphie. The writer of the Constitution Saphie. The Saphie of Many Colors, if you will. The oldest of oldbies may remember me, but for you newbins, I was here on this board way back when it was first created and still on page one. After a few years here, I wandered off to other fandoms and such but I have many fond memories of afternoons in the school library spent faffing off with my fellow PPCers. It does my heart glad to see the place is still providing a place for haters of crappy stories to gather and have fun.  <br><br>Anyhoo, I&#39;m here for a slew of reasons. <br><br>1) If there&#39;s any Suedom fans still hanging around--and last time there were--I wanted to let people know that Andy and I have decided to finish it by way of making it into an entirely original story. We figured out a way (one that involves creating a fantasy world ala Middle-Earth wholecloth). It is going to portray the most epic of friendships and probably be a trilogy. It&#39;s not the first book we&#39;re planning to work on but we&#39;ll get there eventually.  <br><br>2) I wanted to let folks know I&#39;m writing original stuff now and working on my first book. It&#39;s one that totally rips on Fifty Shades of Grey, for those that hate that sort of thing. If you&#39;d like to hear more about it, comment below. If you&#39;d like to follow my progress, I have a twitter, plurk, and tumblr. (kirajlane, kpolil, and kirajlane are my usernames, respectively).   <br><br>3) I just wanted to toss some love your way. Even you newbies that I don&#39;t know. This was the place where I learned several really important things that I&#39;ve applied to my craft, like how to avoid making Mary Sues, how to take criticism, and how a little silliness is never a bad thing. Now that I&#39;m working on my first book (and I have an editor lined up and everything and am a fair way in) I just sort of wanted to go back to my roots and give a little brofist of respect and appreciation. <br><br>Anywat, tis&#39; all. And for those of you that are still in contact with old PPCers that aren&#39;t at the board anymore, let &#39;em know The Saphie Half says hi? (And also says hi on behalf of the Andy Half).</p>

My name&#39;s TheMadHatteress, but some people call me Hattie. Actually, nobody calls me Hattie, but you can if you would like. After taking a quick jaunt over to your tumblr I&#39;ve become very interested in your Fifty Shades bashing story. I read Twilight because I thought that since everyone else was reading it it might be good, and one of the things that really irritated me was how mentally abusive Edward was to Bella. It&#39;s nice to see that someone understands what that behavior really signifies. Oh, and of course the Suedom story sounds marvelous. I can&#39;t wait to see the finished product!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you like the idea! I had those same problems with Twilight, too, especially since I grew up in a really dysfunctional home situation. I&#39;m sort of hypersensitive to stories like that and it bothers me when the author doesn&#39;t at least acknowledge the behavior as abusive or dysfunctional. </p>

            <p>Hello there! I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met before, as I only joined up in May (I&#39;m not sure if that qualifies me as a newbie, but I&#39;m certainly not old enough to remember you) but I&#39;d like to give you a hearty welcome all the same. I&#39;m interested in seeing how you turn Suedom into an original story, so please alert us when if comes out.It&#39;s cool to see someone from a community like this move on to professional writing, as that&#39;s something a lot of us strive for. In the meantime, have my friendship ancientbie, and welcome back. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to be self-publishing but I went to school for writing and I feel I&#39;ve now reached the point where my writing is good enough to put out a book. The big thing to remember is that it takes hard work. <br><br>Also, as much as fanfic and things are fun, anyone who wants to write definitely needs to make time for original stuff too. I learned a LOT from fanfic, internet RP, and fandom, but there were some things I absolutely had to learn from school and writing my original stories, too. <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely alert everyone when the Suedom story is out. Should be a good while from now, but hopefully anyone that would be interested might still be hanging around. </p>

            <p>I did always like the title &quot;Doctor.&quot; /puts on scarf. <br><br>And honestly, from what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s almost EXACTLY the same as it was when I was here. Just a bunch of people mocking good stories, enjoying good ones, and having fun together.

            <p>Suedom was my first introduction to this not-excactly-shared-but-somewhat-overlapping universe. I read that before OFUM and before the Original Series (and yes, that was confusing at times, but I loved it). I was always sad, that the story was never finished.<br>I&#39;d love to read the story you turn it into and everything else you write. The best of luck with it!</p>

You did a great job updating it while still keeping the silliness. <br><br>As for the shipping, Anders and I kinda figure we&#39;re going to get a ton of them when we get published. Two cute author gals that are besties and hug each other a lot? C&#39;mon. <br><br>But you can brag you did it first. XD <br><br>It&#39;s good to see you again!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not going to be out for a while, but if you follow me on twitter, tumblr, or plurk, I&#39;ll mention it when we start working on it. <br><br>As for a title, we have no idea yet. We&#39;re still just developing the concept. <br><br>The way the story will go now is two acquaintances that were friends as girls went their separate ways and had interesting lives, then circumstances conspire to bring them together again. They get pulled into the world of that Earth&#39;s most famous fantasy novel (not Lord of the Rings, we&#39;re making an original fantasy epic up) and discover that when they were teens that world was threatened by the ideas of people in their own reality. They fixed it, but only temporarily, and their minds were wiped of the memories of their adventure and they were sent back home. The two of them wrote a story about their adventures together, fueled by the memories buried in their subconscious, a silly fanfiction about two girls that go on a quest in their favorite fantasy world, but without the memories of how they&#39;d bonded in place life circumstances managed to tear them apart. <br><br>Now the band-aid they put into place has failed and the threat is so awful that both worlds are threatened. They go on an adventure to fix the fantasy world and along the way, they use a copy of their poorly written fanfic about their adventures as a guide to figure out what happened the first time. Unfortunately, since they didn&#39;t remember the adventure and it came from their subconscious minds it&#39;s about as inaccurate sometimes as it is poorly written. As Fortunately, as they go along, they regain the memories and also rediscover the epic friendship they formed with each other that was ripped away from them. <br><br>And then they have to save the world yada yada. <br><br>So it has FOUR intertwined stories and will have excerpts from them. There&#39;s the entirely original fantasy story that was their worlds&#39; version of Lord of the Rings. There&#39;s their first adventure together, experienced in flashbacks. There&#39;s the fanfic they wrote after their knowledge of the adventure was taken away. And there&#39;s the modern day story of them rediscovering it all and saving the worlds.<br><br>It&#39;s going to be pretty meta and complicated and epic. <br><br>But it&#39;s also going to be in development for a good while yet while we write other things first.    </p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve seen you around the few times I peeked in while lurking but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever talked. So...<br><br>HI <br><br>And I&#39;m so glad to hear that. Anders and I have a love-hate relationship with Suedom now, because we loved the ideas in it but hate our old writing since we&#39;ve improved so much. Rather than trying to fix the whole thing, we decided just to make an original story out of it and do the absolute best we can to make it a good piece of lit. <br><br>That said, it&#39;s still great to hear people are enjoying it. <br><br>/brofists back <br><br>I&#39;ll probably only peek in sporadically but I&#39;ll definitely be back to say hi now and again. </p>

            <p>Greetings, fellow anime fan! I suggest you leave any sanity that you might posses in the appropriate reciprocal over there labeled &quot;Useless&quot; as you won&#39;t use it much here. Make sure you check out the handy links above, as they provide entertainment and enlightenment for those who click them; unless of course they&#39;ve run out, in which case you must inform me so I can restock them. <br><br>I feel the need to point out some grammar mistakes, as we are a community focused on celebrating the good writing and mocking the bad. Just make sure you look your post over before you publish it so as to catch any glaring errors before they happen. It&#39;s okay if it happens once or twice, just make sure it&#39;s not a frequent thing.<br><br>And, to commemorate you&#39;re initiation into the wondrous world of the PPC, I give you an anti-thermometer, for measuring everything except temperature, seeing as your frigid self would break it otherwise. </p>

            <p>Ah, I see. If you haven&#39;t seen them already, go watch <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</i> and <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i>. They&#39;re both really, really good (though PMMM is depressing -- Gen Urobutchi, AKA the Urobutcher, wrote it), and don&#39;t let the &#39;Magical Girl&#39; in their names scare you. They&#39;re not <i>Card Captor Sakura</i> or <i>Sailor Moon</i>. </p>

            <p>While I never thought about tasting it, I find it an oddly appealing idea. (Something about giving him something even less comprehensible to think about, I guess.)<br><br>And machinegunning him down is satisfying.

            <p>I&#39;m imagining Kyubey-harvesting being both punishment and reward. If it&#39;s your reward, then you get to go at them while they&#39;re in any terrain you like, with your choice of guns, grenades, and stabby things. For punishment, you have to go at them with just one little knife, in a big city, without anyone seeing you, and then you have to scrape it up off the pavement. </p>

            <p>Thanks to the brilliant commentary and ample help from IntelligentAirhead, I bring to you all the <a href="http://lilywinterwood.tumblr.com/post/31296819354/ppc-the-other-watson">death of Tabitha Watson</a>.<br>Fandom: BBC Sherlock<br>Rating: PG-15 for dirty mouths and Sherlock discussing post-coital refractory periods. We often seem to find him in his plothole around the time of Suvian sex scenes, I&#39;m afraid.<br>Agents: Eledhwen Elerossiel and Christianne Shieh, as well as intern Cale Serfe from the Modern Baker Street Fanfiction Academy<br>Target: Tabitha Watson and Stulock Holmes<br>Word Count: 11,699<br>Things added to continuity: <br>-The PPC sometimes takes in interns from OFUs who shadow Agents on missions. Oftentimes the interns end up joining post-graduation. (Chances are that&#39;s how they got Karen DuLay and Agent Kitty Smith, both of whom are IAHF alums?)<br>-BBC!Holmes, due to his access to the internet and powers of deduction, becomes extremely aware of his situation and of the PPC when he is plotholed away to be character replaced. This was suggested last mission with Alexis Gilmore, but now is confirmed because he recognises Eledhwen. Neuralysation and Bleeprin can cure him of this newfound meta-knowledge until the next replacement.<br>-Glopsnerch also blocks annoying Author&#39;s Notes.<br>-Some types of Character Analysis Devices find the presence of Mary Sues by measuring the amount of Aura of Smooth emitted by characters, and sometimes the residual amounts of Aura of Smooth hovering around plotholes will also be picked up. Perhaps that&#39;s also how litmus strips work? </p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure whether anybody&#39;s written about it yet, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been mentioned that in the worst of the bleepfic and the Legendaries, litmus paper has been known to spontaneously combust when you try to use it. These are the fics where a CAD will explode on entry, so you can&#39;t even take one with you. Usually litmus strips are the solution, but if you want to turn it up to eleven, even the litmus strips won&#39;t last long.<br><br>You usually use them by touching them to the canon or OC in question, but if it&#39;s gotten bad enough, just exposing them to the nearby air would start to turn them funny colors. Of course, by then the agents are half-insane and probably have bumps and bruises from scene shifts, punctuation storms, and flying bits of bad writing; so a few burnt litmus strips are the least of their worries.</p>

            <p>Holmes being able to re-deduce everything was really a great idea. It helps making canon characters more people and less dummies thrown around by the whims of a writer.<br><br>If he keeps going this way, however, it will not take long before we have to add him to the &quot;Canons who know about the PPC&quot; list.</p>

            <p>First and foremost, I love some of the description you&#39;ve got floating around. &#39;despite Tabitha being about as interesting as a bar of soap&#39; caught my eye for some reason (oh, wait, I know the reason: because it&#39;s funny). I also enjoy Cale&#39;s occasional cluelessness - and the &#39;discussion&#39; over the portal was hilarious.<br><br>On the other hand, sometimes &#39;clueless&#39; charges directly into &#39;exposition&#39; without looking back. I could almost see some of the discussions they have (the naming of the Remote Activator, the thing with the DORKS, and the discussion of CADs all come very close together) as acceptable if you were writing this as an &#39;introduction to the PPC for new readers&#39;-type mission - which the intern format would work very well for - but for someone who already knows what&#39;s going on, I don&#39;t think you handled it quite gracefully enough. At times the two experienced agents come across as little more than encyclopaedias.<br><br>That said (am I allowed to keep shifting back and forth on every subject imaginable? I rather think I am), I enjoyed the references to all the heaps of things that make up HQ. PPC Cluedo will have me commenting further down the thread (seriously, like I was ever going to be able to resist a board game), and it makes me grin to see Nurse McKay making a snide appearence.<br><br>So, overall: good mission, you two. The excerpts make it very clear why you killed this one, without turning it into an MST. Nicely done.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Obviously the suspects should include:<br>-Jay Thorntree<br>-Acacia Byrd<br>-Lux<br>-Makes-Things<br>-Dafydd Illian (idek, he&#39;s pretty well known isn&#39;t he?)<br>-The Mysterious Somebody<br>-The Sunflower Official<br>and ten others, because seventeen suspects.<br>And then there need to be at least seventeen weapons (two of which are, as I said, tiny plastic dinosaurs and unicorn blood) and seventeen locations, but knowing the PPC there will be way more weapons and locations than suspects, to mess everyone up. <br>And the layout of HQ on the game board would be highly inaccurate. It&#39;d be a rendition of what someone wished HQ was laid out like, but obviously HQ, being more or less quasi-sentient, would seek to not conform to the layout delineated on the board.<br></p>

            <p>And these look fabulous, haha. <br>Yeah,the risk board looks like a good place to start for the cluedo board, and there is probably a mid-game shifting thing for the layout, perhaps in lieu of secret passages.</p>

(In practice, this would either be decided by the other players, or make it &#39;a random room&#39; and use a random-number generator)<br><br>For board-changing... probably the easiest way would be to make the board from four square sections, which are arranged to form a larger square, and shuffled when a player is enabled (or every third turn, or whatever).
