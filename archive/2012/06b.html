            <p>New guy walking in here. Really excited a place like this even exists!<br><br>So, how do I go about introducing myself? Well, you can call me loomCAT (or Loomcat, or Loom, or l00mc47, if it amuses you). I&#39;m a fan of the fantasy genre in general and play a lot of RPGs. Nothing special. I&#39;ve recently gotten onto a kick where I&#39;ll deliberately play/watch/read fiction I know to be hilariously bad, though I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for the squicky end of fanfiction (not that I can&#39;t handle it, per se, but moreso that I find it an unenjoyable experience, so this site will be a good way to break me in).<br><br>I like a lot a obscure and semi-obscure authors and webcomics and stuff, so if I go off on a tangent about something nobody has ever heard of before, I apologize. I&#39;ve got an obsession with cute things in general so if I ever start squeeing with no warning, you&#39;ll have an idea why.<br><br>...I can&#39;t think of anything else for now; I&#39;m kind of just rambling now. So, uh, here&#39;s hoping for good times and lots of deliciously awful badfic, I guess!</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC. If you&#39;re keen to start ridding the Word Worlds of Sues you could probably do with some weapons, so here, have these Combat Sporks (just make sure to clean the glitter off them quickly, I&#39;m sure that stuff can&#39;t be good for steel). <br><br>Out of interest, when you say you&#39;re into RPGs do you mean computer games or pen-and-paper type stuff?  </p>

            <p>More into computer games, or console games to be more specific. I&#39;ve only ever been in one D&amp;D session my entire lesson. It was... bizarre. Fun, but bizarre.<br><br>I tend to like Eastern RPGs, really. Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, etc. I recently (re)acquired the old N64 RPGs (they are hilariously bad, but I love them anyway). Skyrim and Dragon Age are about the limit to my exposure to the western half of the genre, though.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a fan of both, although I&#39;ve done a lot more tabletopping recently. <br><br>I&#39;m a console gamer myself when it come to most games (although I will use a PC for the occasional RTS), and enjoy many an oldschool RPG. I was extremely pleased when they re-released FFVII on the PS3 store, as I&#39;d lost my original copy of the game many years ago. I&#39;ve not played that much of the Western-RPG offerings either, I just didn&#39;t find them as engaging for some reason. </p>

            <p>What do you mean, I look suspicious? Just because a girl decides to wear a lab coat and carry around a clipboard, suddenly she&#39;s suspicious! Well, I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;m completely respectable, sane, and not at all up to anything whatsoever.<br><br>...<br><br>Okay, fine, you got me.<br><br>Here&#39;s the deal: we have recently been talking about starting a Big Sibs/Little Sibs thingy to help integrate newbies, so that right away every new person gets a Boarder who&#39;s been around a while to talk to who knows about some stuff they&#39;re interested in and can answer questions about the PPC and how we do things around here. You&#39;re the first newbie who&#39;s arrived since the discussion started. I figure if we&#39;re going to do this, we&#39;d best get the ball rolling ASAP, so that means starting with you. ^_^<br><br>The trouble is, we haven&#39;t got all the details hammered out yet, so this really is in its early experimental stages. The idea was that we would have houses or something, kinda like in <i>Harry Potter</i>, to help you pick out the thing(s) you&#39;re most interested in and help us match you up with an oldbie, but we don&#39;t have those yet.<br><br>So... I guess I&#39;ll just ask you: what most interests you about the PPC? What brought you here, and what would you most like to see/know/do more of? For instance, some things we were talking about for house concepts include improving your own writing, helping other people improve theirs (with beta-reading and/or concrit), and in-depth stuff about the PPC setting itself. Also, if you&#39;re inclined toward hanging out in our IRC chat room or doing work on our wiki, those might be good things to know, since some of us have more expertise in those areas than others.<br><br>Definitely don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re restricted to anything I&#39;ve said, though. Your perspective about this is obviously going to be different from that of anyone who&#39;s been here awhile, so any input you have is likely to be really helpful whether it&#39;s what we expect or not. {= )<br><br>Also, as a gift, some general advice: don&#39;t ever sign anything handed to you by someone in a lab coat. It rarely ends well.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who apologizes to Bryn for borrowing her lab coat without asking and promises to return it in the same condition in which she found it: slightly scorched and covered in various stains.</p>

            <p>Okay, well, let&#39;s see. I came to the PPC through TVTropes after hearing that it&#39;s about agents actually going INSIDE of the fanfiction and literally killing the Mary Sues and other aberrations inside. I love meta stuff, and regular sporkings just aren&#39;t enough for me, so I think that&#39;s what made me want to come here.<br><br>I&#39;d certainly like to improve my own writing while I&#39;m here. I&#39;ve never been brave enough to actually post anything publicly, so maybe I can gain some confidence from messing about with the board here. I think that&#39;s what I&#39;d really like to grain here: the nerve to actually SHOW people my work before I trash it out of humiliation.<br><br>Now to my interests, as many people have been curious. As far as the unobscure goes, I like One Piece, Pokemon, Final Fantasy, Power Rangers, and lots of other actiony stuff. I&#39;ll play most any RPG, good or bad, because I love the genre so much. For better or worse, my love of over-the-top action and the like may show up in my missions (assuming I ever do those).<br><br>Those obscure interests? Well, I&#39;ll say &quot;semi-obscure&quot; for now. I only regularly follow three webcomics now: DMFA, Slightly Damned, and my absolute favorite: Housepets! Incidentally, the last of those has a particular fanfic I read that I would very much like to RIP INTO TINY LITTLE PIECES *dissolves into snarling*<br><br>Ahem. Authors? Off the top of my head, the only specific obscure-ish author I can think of is a guy called Ted Dekker, who writes Christian horror/thriller and the like. Seriously. He&#39;s written some pretty cool stuff, buy he&#39;s rather hit-and-miss with his material (Black, Red, and White were all cool. Green was... not, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d know what I meant unless you&#39;ve read his Circle Series), but I still read his books anyway, even if I worry it&#39;ll be the same boring serial killer story again. That said, he&#39;s had some books I genuinely like, so I don&#39;t regret it.<br><br>The height of obscurity (and I&#39;m 99.8% sure none of you have ever heard of this, much less seen this; I also know it doesn&#39;t really count because it&#39;s a web series) is something called &quot;RPG Parade,&quot; a bizarre live-action Youtube series where the actors act out an RPG. Really. It&#39;s very cheaply made (they rarely use special effects more than text or the occasional filter) and absolutely ridiculous, but I love it. Not even in a so-bad-it&#39;s-good way, either. For whatever reason, I legitimately like this show.<br><br>So... I think that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really what everyone wanted to know, but there it is anyway. ^_^ Now if you&#39;ll excuse me for a moment, I need to hoard all these gifts.<br><br>...Incidentally, can I use some of these if I ever go on missions?

            <p>Can I have a big sibling? *puppy dog eyes*<br><br>I was brought to the PPC by Lily Winterwood&#39;s &quot;International Academy of Hetalia Fanfiction&quot;, which is awesome, by the way. I am interested in the huge amount of in-universe stuff, because in-universe stuff is awesome. I decided to join because it seemed like in a place like this- all about good spelling and grammar, reading, writing, and famdoms, which for me was unusual- most fandom people I had met were lacking one of the former, and the few who hadn&#39;t had been cruel, obsessed with spelling and grammar, almost to the point where with some of them I was afraid to type a message for fear of making a mistake or two. They didn&#39;t know that what they were doing was bad, though. Here, everyone is kind. Coming from a school where most people&#39;s prom queen mothers groomed them on what to do and say, that is rather new. I guess I came here because it was different.<br><br>New line, new question! Reading, I love to do. I&#39;m a really fast reader, too. As for writing, I love to write, and I have plenty of ideas, but I&#39;m always second-guessing my work. And I&#39;m a huge procrastinator.<br><br>I&#39;m going to mostly be on the board and the IRC, but I&#39;ll check the wiki if I need to look something up, and if I see any huge error that I&#39;m sure are wrong, I&#39;ll edit it, but other than that, I likely won&#39;t.<br>I&#39;m also likely to change obsessions at least once a month. If I&#39;m too irritating about that, let me know.<br><br>Also, the only thing I&#39;m worried about with the houses is rivalries and after people graduate their houses, not being able to get to know people from outside their houses. But having editing circles of people who share similar interests and writing styles will definitely help.<br><br>So, yeah, I can&#39;t really think of anything else to say. If I missed something important, let me know.</p>

            <p>Consider yourself adopted. {= ) I know very little about <i>Hetalia</i>, but I can be coerced into the chat room on occasion, and I&#39;m always up for talking about PPC stuff and anything to do with writing.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we need to worry about people never talking to anyone outside their house—actually, &quot;house&quot; may be a bit of a misnomer, since the idea isn&#39;t at all to create self-contained societies that do things as a unit. It&#39;s more... I dunno, a staging area? for pairing up sibs. But anyway, do feel free to talk to people who aren&#39;t me.

            <p>Hetalia doesn&#39;t really have any monsters, as far as I know, so there&#39;s no obvious choice for a Mini. Maybe America&#39;s whale, but that only appears onscreen for like four seconds. Mini-Earths? Maybe have little planet Earths hovering around? ^_^ Nah, that probably wouldn&#39;t work, but it&#39;s a funny idea.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve found a fanfic that&#39;s extremely bad. However, the author admits this, and (I believe) is using it to parody badfics. Anyone interested?</p>

            <p>The author explicitly states in the author&#39;s note for chapter two that this fic parodies bad fanfic tropes.  So it&#39;s a simultaneous trolling and sporking.<br><br>I personally found it pretty funny, especially the ending to chapter three.  However, it&#39;s still pretty nauseating to read a lot of the standard badfic stuff, even in a parody.</p>

            <p>Hi! I can&#39;t believe I found you guys! I had heard the PPC existed, and that they were jerks from some of my friends who used to write stuff on fanfiction.net, and then yesterday I was on TV Tropes and stumbled across you guy&#39;s page, and found the stuff with Jay and Acacia and thought it was awesome. I also checked out the wiki, which is how I found this board. I have the Newbie Guide open in another tab right now, actually. Despite what my friends said, you guys seem pretty cool.<br><br>So, yeah, I&#39;m pleased to find you guys, and hope to get along awesomely with all of you!</p>

If you&#39;re wondering what I&#39;m on about, you can look up &quot;Big Sib&quot; on the wiki while you&#39;re there. Basic idea is that I&#39;ll help you out around here, answer any questions you have, etc. You <i>should</i> be able to contact me via email by clicking my name. If that doesn&#39;t work, my email is on the beta reader list, also on thw wiki.<br><br>Incidentally, since this is a fanfiction community at it&#39;s heart, I&#39;ve a few questions of my own. For starters, what&#39;re your fandoms? Do you write fanfiction, or just read it? You&#39;re gonna wait at least a month before asking for permission, right? (Please, for the love of Vera, say yes.)</p>

            <p>Thanks for the offer! To answer your questions, I like a lot of comics and anime, though I&#39;m particularly fond of DC&#39;s new Demon Knights series, Cowboy Bebop, and of course Batman. I have written some fanfiction, but I&#39;m sort of embarrassed by it, and haven&#39;t published it anywhere on the internet. And yes, of course! I did read the rules for permission already!</p>

            <p>While I&#39;m probably enjoying Frankenstein and Dial H a little more than Demon Knights, Demon Knights is definitely up there on my list.

            <p>A few days ago I was reading through some of the awesome stories and entries they have over at the SCP website, and I wondered, just how are universes that could be dangerous to the PPC handled? Such as the SCP and other Creepypasta? Are they avoided or is there ways the PPC deals with it?<br><br>Was just curious. Nothing would be worse than having SCP-173 escape into HQ.

            <p>As well as many things that are hazardous to the health of agents, there are a few fandoms out there which would probably need special procedures to be followed.<br><br>For example, in the Dresdenverse there is an entity that was designed to be a repository for all human knowledge, and magically knows <i>anything</i> that is written down. So agents writing down a charge list as normal might actually tip off a canon character to the existence of the PPC (something which I believe is supposed to be avoided). It could be quite amusing for agents to be forced to charge a Sue from memory, because they don&#39;t dare write anything down while they&#39;re in the fic.  <br><br>I&#39;m sure there are various other continua out there that will have odd little things to make agents&#39; lives that little bit more <s>challenging</s> interesting.<br></p>

            <p>That might be why I thought of it actually, I was reading through the List recently (brought on by the latest chapter of it playing out on the Board).<br><br>Not sure how the not being able to forget things would work with neuralyzers (depending on if it&#39;s a case of she can&#39;t voluntarily forget things, or if she simply <i>cannot</i> loose access to the information once it&#39;s in her brain), but the best of luck to any Agent that wants to try.<br><br><i>&#39;Why hello there Mr Kincaid.

I would imagine that there are a fair few Sues out there that turn up as the apprentice of one Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden, or his lover/rival, and I can think of a few slash pairings that&#39;ll probably turn up quite a bit. </p>

            <p>Bear in mind that anything a canon entity learned about the PPC wouldn&#39;t be canon, so unless there&#39;s a really compelling reason otherwise (such as the character being a god or it just being extremely funny), then any non-canon knowledge ought to be wiped out once the badfic is killed and canon snaps back.

            <p>Others have covered doing missions in dangerous universes already, but in the case where the Sue herself is extra dangerous (an overpowered God mode Sue) the general approach is to get backup: either bring in Agents that are trained to deal with dangerous opponents (like the DMS Special Operations division or ESAS) or else swarm the Sue with so many Agents she can&#39;t resist (e.g the all-agents exorcism of Alumia by DoGA). <br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>There are quite a few fandoms out there with the potential for risk regarding the safety of the PPC. You&#39;ve got things like radiation, zombie viruses, brain parasites, doppelgangers, mind control spells, alien races bent on assimilation, and other various sorts of nastiness.<br><br>How do we deal with all that? Simple. We don&#39;t write about it.<br><br>I&#39;m sure we could come up with any number of in-universe reasons for why agents aren&#39;t coming down with the Green Flu or getting indoctrinated or what have you. The main reason, I believe, is that writing those stories is something that most people don&#39;t want to do. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t around during the various Emergencies, but from what I&#39;ve heard they were a pain in the rear to write. After a while, people probably just wanted HQ to remain a safe - if somewhat odd - place. Somewhere stable. Keep the crazy drama to a more manageable (and tolerable) level.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there are any continuums that are deliberately avoided for being dangerous. Because their authors don&#39;t allow fanfiction, yes. But remember: writing missions shouldn&#39;t be about going after the most horrendous or most dangerous badfic. It should be about writing the best, most entertaining story YOU can.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>That makes sense, though I was looking at it more from an in-universe point of view. Not so much us writing the stories, but as if it was a true existing organisation. Wanted to see peoples different opinions on how they&#39;d think the PPC would deal with it. :p</p>

            <p>The ground rule for the PPC is that none of the stories are canon, only the SCP numbers themselves. So all of the stories on the site are considered fanfics.<br><br>Also, ohgod.

            <p>So what&#39;s a guy to do but add stuff to the list?<br><br>Mass Effect: What about the Reapers? You know, massive eldritch abominations that can dwarf entire fleets of ships and mow down everything in its path with barely a scratch to show for it. The fact that they exterminate all organic life every 50,000 years doesn&#39;t help. Oh yeah, and they can also bend your will so that you become their slaves, and you won&#39;t even know you&#39;re under their thrall until they&#39;ve already hijacked your mind and you&#39;re left to bang on a mental wall while your body does things that you don&#39;t want it to do. Oh, yeah, and then there are the husks. Yeah, if one of those things found out about the PPC, it would likely result in an emergency.</p>

            <p>Plus you have looser canons, like the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, where world-destructions happen on an almost regular basis. Also:<br><br>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: The corrupted book of darkness. Devours everything it touches, grows, and can only be destroyed by a giant space cannon that also demolishes everything for a couple hundred miles around. Though, my agents once used that cannon as an execution method, but still. <br><br>Puella Magi Madoka Magica:...most everything, actually.

            <p>In Nanoha, the power levels are fairly high (think about a Mahou Shoujo version of Dragonball or Gundam), so the replacement of a major character is a fairly serious problem too.<br><br>For a direct example, the mission &quot;Legendary Illogic&quot;, by Firemagic and me. Basically, a Replacement!Nanoha, after being completely drained of her magic power, still managed to survive being struck by a very powerful lightning-based attack. (And by &quot;very powerful&quot;, we mean &quot;we had to basically resort to the most powerful combination technique we had while wondering if it was actually plausible for PPC Agents&quot;)<br><br>About Madoka, our only hope is that nothing exits from pre-Madokami Madokaverse (exceptions made for recruits, of course).<br><br>Especially Kyubey. Although the nursery problem can be easily solved by making Kyubey-hating Agents make surveillance turns. If he just keeps being shredded on sight with extreme prejudice and without being able to get near potential magical girls, he will reach the point where he will think that going after Nursery teenagers isn&#39;t cost-efficient, right?<br><br>After all, one of the reasons why he didn&#39;t give up on Madoka when Homura started going after him is because he had found a golden-egg-laying hen. Enough energy to fulfill the planet&#39;s quota and maybe even more in one go? Homura probably would have had to <i>make his entire race extinct</i> to keep Madoka from being pestered by them.</p>

            <p>Ah, and Annihilation Lightning is stated to be LETHAL with a direct hit. And it took up most of the magic that Ari grabbed from around Hogwarts, and the magic from draining Harry and Not!Nanoha, plus the extra she got from Unisoning with Corolla (so it was insanely powerful, but a one-time thing until she can find more absurdly powerful Sues and magic-filled environments.)<br><br>And really, a Witch or Lost Logia loose in HQ could be disastrous. Even something like a Jewel Seed, which is tame considering things like the BoD, the Saint&#39;s Cradle, and the Mariage, could be deadly in the hands of the wrong person. At best, it might end up making a giant cat start wandering the halls, or a water-monster that tears off people&#39;s clothes (yes, that happened. In a Sound Stage, yes, but still. Kyouya clearly has some issues left over from his origin game.) And, can you imagine what would happen if the Mariage got loose in Headquarters? Demon cyborg ladies everywhere!</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! Ever since I completed the fourth chapter in the Mass Effect/Fallout crossover, <i>Mass Vexations: Redemption</i>, I&#39;ve been looking for a beta.

            <p>So I started watching Doctor Who recently, and I had a question about the Weeping Angels. According to canon, if they were observed, their quantum-locking mechanism would turn them to stone, thus rendering them nearly impossible to kill. However, the only form of observation that I saw, that activated the Angels&#39; quantum-locking, appeared to be sight. So, my question is this: Would it be possible to kill an Angel if you were an excellent martial artist that happened to be blind?</p>

            <p>... quite often they seem to be quantum-locked by <i>us watching the show</i> (back in &#39;Blink&#39; we often saw locked Angels when there was no-one else actually looking, such as... well, actually, the very first shots of them moving through the greenhouse/garden were locked by the viewers, not the cast), I think they&#39;re very sensitive to observation of all kinds. Probably including robots.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Yes, I know we saw them move in Flesh And Stone - but since they still had the stone-effect, I choose to believe they were exploiting the framerate of the camera and moving in between frames.

            <p>If I remember rightly, when the Weeping Angels show up for the second time (in an episode involving the 11th Doctor, Amy, River Song, some strangely militant &#39;clerics&#39; and a crashed spaceship), it&#39;s revealed that any image of an Angel <i>becomes</i> an Angel. <br><br>They&#39;ve got one trapped in a container of some kind, with a security camera watching it to keep it quantum-locked, and the fact that it&#39;s being watched (even by a mechanical system) somehow allows it to escape, or a new one to be created, or something like that. I can&#39;t remember the exact details, it&#39;s been too long since I watched it, but Bad Things happen as a result of the camera. <br><br>I suppose if the robot had purely non-visual sensors like radar, LIDAR or ultrasound, then you might be able to get away with it, as it wouldn&#39;t be creating an &#39;image&#39; in the usual sense. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think so. If you&#39;re blind, you&#39;re not looking at them, and (I&#39;m assuming the martial artist is human) they are really, really, really fast. They&#39;ll send you to the past in no time.</p>

            <p>Firstly, it does depend on what you mean by &#39;take on&#39;, after all, in the episode Blink, the Doctor manages to outwit the four Angels he faces, and leaves them in a state of being permanently quantum-locked. Any other quick-thinker may be able to do something similar, once they know what they&#39;re up against. <br><br>If you do mean literal hand-to-hand combat, there are a couple of potential ways of achieving that without slipping into sueishness. As has been pointed out already, the main problem with a fistfight is that they can send you back into the past with a touch, so you&#39;re probably only going to get one hit in before you find yourself located inconveniently elsewhere. But if you&#39;ve got access to a method of time travel (such as a Time Agent&#39;s Vortex Manipulator), then essentially no harm has been done to you. You could pop back to the present, hit it again, and repeat until a victor emerges or you both get bored of the whole thing. The only reason it caused problems for the Doctor and Martha in Blink was that they couldn&#39;t get back to the TARDIS in the past, but if you carry your time travel device with you, it won&#39;t be as much of a problem.<br><br>The other option is to get some sort of device, or material with special properties, that allow an item to be locked into a single timeline and build that into a suit of armour. Given that there are a few time travel technologies around in the Whoniverse, a sort of &#39;time lock&#39; technology isn&#39;t that much of a stretch in my opinion. <br><br>A human who is <i>born</i> with such an ability would be very speshul indeed, but any organisation intending on combating the Angels would be very well advised to spend a portion of their R&amp;D budget on time-locked armour.<br><br>The biggest challenge to overcome is that &#39;that which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel&#39;. This leaves you with two main options in a fight. Either have the Angel be observed, and hope that it is dealt with before any of the observers become Angels themselves, or don&#39;t observe it directly, and hope that you can keep pace with it (after all, they are frighteningly fast).<br><br>I think it&#39;s possible for a non-Sue human to be able to beat an Angel in single combat, but they’ll need a lot of preparation and specialised equipment. As long as where all that came from is adequately explained, it should be fine. <br></p>

            <p>Hi! I just joined here a few days ago, but even so I&#39;d like to say WELCOME TO OUR HUMBLE INSANITORIUM! *mad laughter*<br><br>Ahem. Too much?

            <p>About me. Hmm. Where to begin? I love books. Honestly, place a book larger then a hundred pages, I&#39;ll probably read it - good or not - but I haven&#39;t read any fiction like The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter lately. I&#39;ve mainly been struggling through books like The Illiad and Tale of Two Cities. Now that I have finished those, though, I have been starved for entertainment. Then, Lo and Behold, here is a site that can provide such fun. I look forward to being apart of this community.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read the Odyssey several times, but always found the Iliad harder to get into.  I think part of my problem is that I&#39;ve had trouble finding a translation of the Iliad that I like -- when I know it was written as poetry, block-o-text prose translation doesn&#39;t cut it.<br><br>And have some welcome-fudge!</p>

            <p>In terms of loving books that is. I admire your courage in tackling The Illiad, I was dying when I had to read The Odyssey for class. As a token of that courage and for the fact that you haven&#39;t read fiction/fantasy in a while I shall give you the Ultimate Volume of Fairy Tales*! Each time you open it it awards you with a new fairy tale or other fantasy story.<br><br>*That&#39;s &quot;tales&quot; mind you.

            <p>Hi there, and welcome to the PPC Board-and-wider-community. As you can see, I&#39;m Huinesoron - I&#39;ve been here since around the Triassic Era, and I&#39;m still pretty much only a Lord of the Rings fan. I&#39;m also slightly crazy (it helps, in this place).<br><br>You, I can see, am blurfsmurf - but what else is there to know about you? How&#39;d you find us (was it the pixies? Curse those meddling pixies!)? Do you read or write fanfiction - and what fandoms? Have you read many of the PPC&#39;s stories? And, perhaps most importantly of all, [insert really pertinent question here]?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>No. It wasn&#39;t the pixies. It was the little birds. They called themselves the &quot;OFU&#39;s&quot;. From that, I believe you should be able to discern the answer to your following question. As for your final question, who ever said I was pertinent?</p>

I am a fan of Discworld, Tad Williams, Tamora Pierce, George R R Martin, J V Jones, Joe Abercrombie, Katherine Kerr and way too many others to name. Books are my main interest and I have an annoying memory which only remembers pointless trivia. I discovered fanfiction a few years back and loved the idea. I wrote, but I was too shy to share. This was a good thing. After a while I realised there was some awful, awful writing out there and I wanted to do something about it. When I discovered the PPC I decided I would research its background then introduce myself. So here I am.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to be ambiguous. Where to start? I&#39;m an A level student aged sixteen nearly seventeen. I have (unfortunatly) written badfic in the past.

            <p>Fantasy is my love and joy! Science fiction is a close second but they lose points for having unpronounceable names more often.

            <p>Greetings, new friend!  Welcome to the group!<br><br>There are some useful and highly recommended links at the top of the Board, up ^ there.  You&#39;ll especially want to read over the Constitution!  Our wiki is an excellent source of information for the inquisitive mind.  Finally, the chat is a place to encounter wild PPCers in their native habitat.  Not to worry!  Most of them only bite a little, and only if you don&#39;t share your chocolate!<br><br>I shall also link you to Jay and Acacia&#39;s Original Series, the fic that got us all started out!  If you haven&#39;t had a chance to read it yet, I highly recommend it!  It is found here:<br><a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html"><a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html</a></a><br><br>We&#39;re currently trying to revitalize an old Big Sibling program wherein new members can turn to someone who&#39;s been around longer for learning the ropes.  We don&#39;t quite have the new model organized yet, but in the meantime, feel free to use me as a surrogate Big Sib!  If you&#39;re having trouble finding anything on our Wiki, I can be reached through email at keyoflit(at)yahoo(dot)com (with symbols standing in in the obvious places) or through AIM, which stupidly also uses my email because I am incompetent at setting those programs up.  You&#39;re also welcome to ask questions right here in this thread.<br><br>So, tell us a bit about yourself!  What fandoms are you into?  Are you primarily a reader or a writer?  What sort of story do you prefer, in either case?</p>

            <p>Thanks, I was told everyone would be friendly, but it&#39;s good to have confiramation. I like to think of myself as a writer, but am a reader in reality (due to procrastination and the like). I mostly go for slightly dry humour, such as Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (Pit of Voles, I do recommend it though) and I like to think my writing style is similar.</p>

            <p>You have our permission to introduce yourself. ;) Me, I&#39;m Huinesoron (or hS, or various misspellings of those two), and I&#39;ve been around here a loooong time. I&#39;m a Lord of the Rings fanatic (still!), and even occasionally write things in the fandom, but for the most part my fanfic these days tends to be PPC-related.<br><br>And what about you?

            <p>I found the fanfiction universities via that wonderous waste of time TVTropes and having done so gradually realised there was so much more. I read and try to write. I haven&#39;t put any of my stuff online due to a lack of time to write in. On the topic of fandoms I&#39;m into most fantasy books, some quite obscure and the TV shows I&#39;m into are Game of Thrones, Doctor Who and Primeval. It would probably be helpful to mention that I&#39;m British as well. I&#39;ve read the original series and am working my way through the list on the wiki, I&#39;m currently on Character Protective Services, so a long way to go yet.</p>

            <p>Since the previous discussion on this topic, kicked off by the awesome Irish Samurai in response to another discussion started by the awesome PoorCynic, has fallen off the front page (and was getting rather unwieldy besides), I&#39;m bringing it back up so we can keep working on this. There&#39;s still lots to do and more voices are badly needed!<br><br>What we&#39;ve got so far is a developing &quot;charter&quot; for what this is for and how it works, and a few proposed houses and Big Sibs in them. I&#39;ll start with the charter, now on its third revision thanks to input from hS:<br><br><b>1. <u>PPC Goals</u></b><br><br>These are the primary goals of any PPCer or group of PPCers.<br><ol>
<li>To encourage and celebrate good writing, be it by reading and/or writing good stories, by giving concrit, by beta-reading, etc.;</li>
<br><li>To have fun with bad writing, be it in the form of missions, MSTs, just talking about it, etc.;</li>
<br><li>To celebrate fandom in its many forms, whether in writing, in art, in role-play, in nerdy holidays, etc.;</li>
<br><li>To have fun, fulfilling, and safe community interactions with other PPCers, wheresoever you prefer to do so;</li>
<br><li>To do the above with respect for each other, for badfic authors and others, and for our community spaces, so we can all have a good time and not give anyone a justification for calling us big fat annoying stupid meanie-heads.</li>
</ol>
<br><b>2. <u>House Goals</u></b><br><br>Secondary to the above PPC Goals, these are the specific aims of the Big/Little Sib &quot;Houses&quot; program.<br><ol>
<li>To make it easier/less scary for newbies to approach and get to know older PPCers;</li>
<br><li>To give newbies a mentor/teacher they can always ask questions and advice;</li>
<br><li>To provide a network of support for Big Sibs in particular, but all members in general, so no one person gets overwhelmed trying to mentor/advise/guide/correct/befriend/whatever all the new people, and so there are clear channels of support open for advice on given topics about which members of a given house are knowledgeable;</li>
<br><li>To get older PPCers more involved and more personally invested in the PPC Goals by giving them a specific obligation toward other PPCers. In other words, if your Little Sibs are driving us up the wall, we&#39;re going to Have Words with You;</li>
<br><li>
<b>Not</b> to become cliques whose members never talk to anyone outside their sibs/house;</li>
<br><li>
<b>Not</b> to devalue the importance of other houses&#39; interests. In other words, just because your group isn&#39;t big on giving concrit doesn&#39;t mean people in it should believe concrit is stupid, since that would contradict the PPC Goals.</li>
</ol>
<br><b>3. <u>House Structure</u></b><br><br>This is how houses work.<br><ol>
<li>Houses shall be made up of oldbies willing to be Big Sibs to newbies, with the responsibilities that role entails;</li>
<br><li>All Big Sibs shall have a working knowledge of PPC in-universe canon and PPC rules, policies, social mores and folkways, etc., and be willing and able to teach their Little Sibs;</li>
<br><li>Each house shall have a stated area of expertise that sets it apart from other houses, to provide newbies with something to identify as a personal interest and thus efficiently narrow the field of potential Big Sibs, preventing much flailing and confusion over who should step up. However, this area of expertise should not be too specific (i.e. <i>Lord of the Rings</i> humorfic concrit in the IRC), because that would just get really silly really fast and leave us open for too many <i>Clue</i> jokes;</li>
<br><li>Each house shall have a silly name that doesn&#39;t necessarily bear any relation to its area of expertise;</li>
<br><li>Newbies shall be given a list of houses and their descriptions upon joining, and asked to select one. In order to prevent popularity/intimidation from becoming a factor, this list shall not include names of Big Sibs;</li>
<br><li>A Big Sib from the newbie&#39;s chosen house will then elect to adopt that newbie as their Little Sib, according to availability and/or compatibility; considerations may include fandoms in common, interest in the IRC or wiki, and other matters not covered in house descriptions;</li>
<br><li>Each Big Sib may adopt as many Little Sibs as they are comfortable with.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>This is all pending approval! So far I&#39;ve really only heard suggestions from hS. It would be good to know if everybody doing the Big Sibs thing is on the same page or not.<br><br>Now, existing houses (or at least, names that have been shouted out):<br><ol>
<li>House Kind Words and a Two-by-Four: This house is big on giving constructive criticism. This house is made up of Boarders who are interested in improving their writing skills, in general, and helping other people improve as well. Current members: 2.</li>
<br><li>House Darjeeling: This house is steeped in the history, lore, and traditions of the PPC. Also delicious with scones. Current members: 3.</li>
<br><li>House Skull Goblet: ??? Current members: 1.</li>
</ol>
<br>Names of people who are already members have been purposefully left out here, because part of the point is that newbies should pick out houses based on description, not who&#39;s in them, and I imagine a few unadopted newbies may be reading this. If you really wanna know, check out the original thread <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=226487;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">from this post</a>.<br><br>Now, if you&#39;re a Big Sib volunteer, what we really need you to do is 1) give feedback on the charter; 2) join a house if there&#39;s one you like the look of; or 3) start a new house if there&#39;s something you feel is your area of expertise that hasn&#39;t been covered yet. Also, make sure you tell us what your house is going to be for. {= P<br><br>If you&#39;re not a Big Sib volunteer, consider volunteering, and see above! If not, you can still offer feedback, so please do!<br><br>~Neshomeh, determined not to let this die a-borning.</p>

            <p>House Name: House Tryforce<br>Area: Areas involving video gaming. Basically to try and break away from the video gaming mechnics which a lot of authors get stuck in. (E.g: Pokemon battles where the Pokemon stands there, taking turns to attack each other, not moving, etc). It would also be there to help people whose agents come from certain gaming universes, as well as provide critique for Missions which take place in a video game</p>

            <p>Despite the name being a joke based on the greet message that I had set to show up when I logged into the IRC, I suppose I should outline the mission statement of House Skull Goblet.<br><br>&quot;House Skull Goblet: This house is focused mainly on showing newbies the ropes of the wiki, IRC, Board, etc. so that others aren&#39;t left so frustrated they want to turn the newbies&#39; skulls into goblets. To be more concise, the house is focused on the community, and helping newbies fit in.&quot;<br><br>Of course, having me be the sole person in charge of the house focused on the community is proooobably not right.

            <p>I hereby propose the creation of House Grave Energy Initiative. <br><br>I may be breaking the rules by the House name being slightly linked to its purpose, but it was too much of a good line to pass up. (Green energy = grave energy? Get it? NVM.) This would be a writing-emphasis house, working on not just PPCing but the mechanics of fiction in general. Worldbuilding, proper description, character building and motivation, the whole nine yards. Fantasy a specialty.

            <p>Would there be room in House Grave Energy Initiative for a Big Sib whose interests lean slightly more towards writing original sci-fi? <br><br>World-building is probably one of my favourite things about writing, although most of what I&#39;ve done recently has been for tabletop RPGs rather than stories, so it&#39;s had a slightly different focus. <br><br>I can do fantasy, and I certainly read a lot of it, although when it comes to thinking up storylines, or ideas for quests, my brain just seems to naturally favour futuristic settings. </p>

            <p>I certainly second Irish Samurai on the inclusion of sci-fi if possible. (I lean in that direction, too.) I think House Grave Energy Initiative would probably suit me the most (although with a hint of Darjeeling on the side).<br><br>Maybe House Grave Energy Initiative would be better as a general original writing house if you could get enough Big Sibs with varied specialties?</p>

            <p>I think this charter looks good, and I would definitely still be up for acting as a Big Sib myself, although I’m not sure about a House at the moment. When I graduate (or whatever term we’re going to use) from Kind Words and a Two-by-Four I’ll certainly consider reapplying as a Big Sib for them. <br><br>In the meantime, I’ll have a think about establishing a House myself, although I don’t have any firm ideas for that yet. <br><br>Thinking specifically about my own potential as a Big Sib, if I were to take on a newbie and get asked a question I didn’t know the answer to, I wouldn’t necessarily know who the best person to redirect it to was. It might be worth having a bit of info about each Big Sib, basically just strengths/areas of expertise, that people can look up if they need to (I’m thinking only of Big Sib to Big Sib interactions here, as it’s already been established that we don’t want newbies to be able to ask for a specific Big Sib by name). Or, is a personal knowledge of each other Big Sib’s key strengths a part of being a suitable Big Sib, which could sort of be covered under point 2 of the House Structure guidelines? <br></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see there really being a &quot;graduation&quot; or any formal breaking away. The way I figure, it&#39;s an organic process of learning and becoming more comfortable in your own right and less dependent on your Big Sib—eventually, they&#39;re just your friend rather than your mentor, but they don&#39;t stop being your Big Sib. That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re stuck in their house, though, if you end up feeling more suited to something else. &quot;Houses shall be made up of oldbies willing to be Big Sibs to newbies,&quot; not Big Sibs and Little Sibs—it&#39;s worded that way on purpose. {= ) I could definitely shoot for clearer wording about Little Sibs not actually being in the houses, though. (That&#39;s part of why this discussion is really important.)<br><br>As for knowing who&#39;s who among ourselves, that is a problem that wiki categories are uniquely suited to solving, I think. I&#39;m positing sub-categories of the PPC Boarders category, Category:House Darjeeling, Category:House Kind Words and a Two-by-Four, etc., that would be applied to Big Sibs&#39; user pages. There could also be a list on the category page itself, to cover <s>heathens</s> people who don&#39;t have wiki user accounts. This will be especially helpful if we end up having Big Sibs in more than one house.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since I&#39;ve come up with an excuse...<br><br>I hereby present:<br><br>House Parmandili (Quenya: <i>Book-friends</i>)- the house for those utterly obsessed with their fandom (to the point where they, say, learn the languages... heh). Of course that doesn&#39;t mean all of us can answer every question about every canon ever - but we can help you find someone who can, and discuss how much enthusing is appropriate in the community.<br><br>I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m allowed to be in Darjeeling and Parmandili at the same time, despite problems it will cause with the Inter-House Valinorean Cricket Tournament...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Also, a Suggested House, not an actual creation: in line with Neshomeh&#39;s comments, a house for those who are primarily here to meet people and talk a lot might be a good idea, to go with those for people who concrit, PPC-love, and fandom-enthuse. ~hS</p>

            <p>I personally think being in multiple houses defeats the purpose of narrowing the field of selection, but it might have to do if enough people are concerned about it.<br><br>My feelings are that you should pick the house for the thing in which you feel you&#39;re the <i>most</i> expert, the most comfortable teaching someone else, rather than spreading yourself across your entire field of interests. I mean, I could hypothetically be in Darjeeling, Two-by-Four, Rule of Funny, Writerly Writers, Betta Betas, Hanging Out and Doing Stuff, etc. etc., but that wouldn&#39;t do me or anyone else any good in the end because I&#39;d never be able to keep it straight.<br><br>On the other hand, if people really, really feel like they can&#39;t decide, maybe a limit of two would work as a compromise?<br><br>Also, I definitely think there should be a house for writerly writers, who are interested in doing original stuff. Tungsten and I sorta talked about it. I may be not-so-subtly trying to nudge her into founding it. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think it should be fine for Big Sibs to belong to multiple Houses, unless it gets to the point where the <i>majority</i> of Big Sibs are in the <i>majority</i> of the available Houses. <br><br>If it were to reach that stage, there wouldn&#39;t be much point in having the defining characteristics of the individual Houses, and it would probably make just as much sense to go back to a general Big Sib pool. The House descriptions would effectively end up just being shorthand ways of newbies categorizing themselves, and you&#39;d probably get a more detailed impression of what they were like by asking questions along the lines of &#39;What sort of stuff do you like to read? Have you written any fanfiction, if so what for? etc.&#39;, so it would sort of fall apart. <br><br>Having a limit in place to prevent that from occuring is a good thing in my opinion. Personally, I&#39;d probably only <i>want</i> to be in two Houses (maybe three at the outside) at once anyway, just because otherwise I wouldn&#39;t feel like I was focusing properly on the Houses&#39; goals. </p>

            <p>There&#39;s nothing in your Charter that indicates to me that &#39;membership&#39; (if such a thing even really exists) should be restricted. Houses are all about helping out newbies and oldbies alike, and saying we should be restricted seems... well... restricting.<br><br>Let&#39;s come back to Lacksidacksical for an example. She shows up and says &#39;I think I&#39;m in Darjeeling, but I feel like I&#39;d get on well with Parmandili too.&#39; Now we know what sort of person she is: someone who gets obsessed with fandoms, and particularly with the PPC. If I artificially limited myself to Parmandili, I would have to shrug and say &#39;Not my house, not my problem&#39;. But I&#39;m not just a Parmandili person - I&#39;m a Darjeeling-type as well, and somewhat a Grave Energy Initiative type too. I can&#39;t see any reason that, just because Lacksidacksical has a slightly altered order of priorities, I should ignore her when actually we have the same fields of interest.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s clear, so let me try another phrasing: if Houses are essentially ways of formalising fields of interest with short snappy phrases, I can have multiple strong areas of interest, so why shouldn&#39;t I say I&#39;m in multiple houses?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My counter-argument is pretty much what I already said: part of the purpose of having houses is to narrow the field of Big Sib candidates (which probably should go in the charter if it isn&#39;t in there yet). If we were to go totally limits-free and say everyone should be in as many houses as describe them, then houses would be merely descriptors, and would no longer serve a purpose in parceling out the load, because the people in the most houses are clearly the top candidates for any given newbie. Limiting the Big Sibs&#39; house involvement <i>is</i> basically so they have the leisure to say &quot;Not my house, not my problem&quot; sometimes, and conversely so there&#39;s a clearer obligation to stand up when it IS your house.<br><br>Also, as you say, it is an entirely artificial limitation. Nobody&#39;s interests are actually limited to just one thing, and I think we all know that; it&#39;s just a way of delineating groups. We could do the same thing by alphabetical order, or birthday, or something equally arbitrary. Perhaps that would be less confusing than grouping by interests... but it starts to verge on the dry and boring, too, so I wouldn&#39;t advocate for that. {= P<br><br>Also like I said before, I think the system could stretch as far as allowing a Big Sib to represent up to two houses and still function, but I think any more than that starts to break it down, as I said above. If you really really <i>really</i> can&#39;t make up your mind, then you&#39;ve got some wiggle room, but you don&#39;t risk stretching yourself too thin.<br><br>For the record, I think newbies need to pick just one house, even more so if we&#39;ve got Big Sibs in more than one. Otherwise there&#39;s that same problem of nobody knowing for sure whose turn it is to step up, which risks nobody stepping up, and then the Dark Side wins.<br><br>Or something.<br><br>I&#39;m about to run out the door for the weekend. &gt;.&gt; More on this later!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Additionally, it makes everything more complicated, because beyond a simple headcount that can be done within a single house- &quot;Hey, who can take this newbie? Hey, X, I see you only have a couple, would you take them?&quot; it becomes a massive, stupidly complex affair, because then you need to be ask how many newbies they have for other houses too, or even ask the other house themselves.<br><br>The reason I suggested houses was to give it a bit of an organizational component that&#39;d help keep it going. <br><br>Multiple houses kinda makes there be no point to having them in the first place. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been here for about... a month and a half I think. It really feels longer (probably because I was lurking for a couple months before I joined) and I no longer feel like I need guidance on the Board. Areas like the IRC and the Wiki though, I still feel a bit lost. My question is, am I past the need of a Big Sib? If so can I have like a Twin Sib or something as just a friend who can give me a few pointers once in a while?</p>

            <p>The charter so far already includes items and concerns I had brought up personally (and ideas I had brought up in the first place).<br><br>As it stands, though, with the fourth item for House Goals, I can see this becoming a problem. Anyone who has real life siblings know they do not have utter control over them.

I can&#39;t stop them from doing something if they really, really decide to, after all, and it would be unfair for us to put the burden of that on someone. <br><br>And with regards to communication, it does mean that those in the same house <i>will</i> need to set something up in some manner for group wide communication, be it group email or using a talk page on the wiki or something, so people are all on the same page, and there&#39;s more cross-talk going on beyond just pairs.

            <p>That item can be rewritten—the main point is that you <i>are</i> primarily responsible for letting your sibs know what is and isn&#39;t okay, and that we will be wondering what&#39;s up if they&#39;re running amok and there&#39;s no sign of anything being done about it, but yeah, it should be a question first. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up here?

            <p>This most recent version of the charter is the best I&#39;ve seen yet, and I would be happy to subscribe to it.<br><br>I&#39;m also, finally, behind the concept of the Houses, as long as we can get and keep them organized.  I can see the value in mini-&quot;committees&quot; having a brief discussion over who would best suit the newbie as Big Sib.<br><br>My one concern is what happens when a newbie clearly fits two or more Houses.  I guess the mini-committees will have to meet and come to a decision that way?<br><br>To be honest, this is a problem I&#39;m having.  I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m at least partly involved in multiple aspects of the PPC: I use the Board, Chat and Wiki; I&#39;ve read most of the stuff from Jay and Acacia&#39;s day (although I&#39;m still trying to find time to finish hS&#39; history stuff!  Alas!) and everything that&#39;s been published since I joined.  I&#39;ve betad at least a dozen PPC writings (probably more; haven&#39;t been keeping track) and try to leave a comment on everything if I have something of value to say.<br><br>I just don&#39;t know where I fit in.  Maybe I&#39;ll be . . . the Rogue Sibling, sneaking about in the shadows of all the houses, nicking a couple of Lil Sibs from everywhere and generally causing confusion.<br><br>Do any other official/prospective Big Sib volunteers have this problem?</p>

            <p>I accidentally stumbled upon the PPC while looking up the term &#39;Mary Sue&#39; (under related topics, presumably) and started reading. I then continued reading, because it was so brilliantly humorous. I have now read roughly half of The Original Series by Jay and Acacia, half of Tawinki Penguin&#39;s arc, various things on the wiki and the first part of a lab report by Cocoa and Powder. Now I am bristling with ideas that I will have to keep a lid on for at least a month.<br><br>Anyway, now I have finally gathered up my courage enough to introduce myself. I look forward to meeting the community.</p>

            <p>While I am unsure of the question itself, I can assume that you can try to &quot;claim&quot; mini&#39;s before you write a mission. Just make sure you get permission to write, and then claim the badfic on the wiki 9<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic</a></a>).

The two minis in question are already listed as available for adoption on the appropriate Wiki page, but have not been adopted by anybody yet.

            <p>Just found a badfic on the Pit of Voles. It&#39;s a crossover between Lord of the Rings and Eragon in name only. The main characters are Glingallas (which it claims means Hanging Leaf Flame) son of Legolas and a human boy named Wolf. The grammar, spelling and logic are dreadful. The paragraphs don&#39;t last a logical amount of time. It claims that the bonding is the same as that in Eragon, when it was only dragons in Eragon. None of the names make sense. There are only three chapters, the third of which is a repeat of the AN in the second chapter. The chapters are quite short, but I&#39;m sure a long charge list could still be made. If anyone&#39;s interested I&#39;ll put the link on here.</p>

            <p>Those types of badfic almost always betray their setting entirely - no matter what the premise of the story is, &quot;Everyone and their grandmother converts to (a very, very specific subset of a denomination of) Christianity&quot; is always jarring. I mean, you could throw that plot at <i>Narnia</i> and it would throw everyone off, for pity&#39;s sake.<br><br>(Though not quite as badly as people who attempt to retrofit the entire canon to fit their specific idea of the world/Christianity. That&#39;s worse. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/903321/1/Watership_Down_The_bCrossBearer_b"> is, to this day, one of the only &#39;fics I&#39;ve ever seriously considered missioning.)<br><br>So honestly, even giving a canon doesn&#39;t narrow it down - your best bet is to try and find the site you found it on first, and search key words in that fandom until something comes up.</a></p>

            <p>FINALLY SOMETHING TO READ--Ahem.<br><br>Very funny!  I know nothing of Hetalia, but I still understood all the humor since it used common stereotypes of the countries.  I don&#39;t know how much of that was your characterization, and how much was already present in canon, but either way, it worked.<br><br>I kind of got lost keeping track of the hiragana, even with Japan&#39;s helpful guide.

            <p>A lot of fanfictions for Hetalia claim that the countries can feel every single one of their citizens but it&#39;s never mentioned in canon so I would say they wouldn&#39;t really be able to tell anything about that person, including the PPC. If you think about it too, if the countries were able to know everything about their inhabitants then wouldn&#39;t they be able to stop corrupt leaders from coming to power? <br>But if anyone were to know about the PPC it would be France because of the he technically owns New Caledonia.

            <p>Hey, everyone!  I used to be a kind-of regular here, but for the past several months or so, Real Life has gotten in the way and I&#39;ve sort of... faded out of the PPC.

            <p>For the most part, from what I&#39;ve seen, oldbies (of the more than a few years variety) tend to not make &#39;I&#39;m back!&#39; posts unless they&#39;ve been gone for more than a couple years or have otherwise made clear they were leaving for Reasons which would mean Forever or some such or are coming back due to Reasons, while  a few of the newer bunch seem to take disappearing every few weeks (in the measurable in <br>School happens, life happens, work happens.

            <p>I know exactly what you mean.  I stopped reading right around when they were boarding the Hogwarts Express.  All I could think was that Not-Harry should get along with Ron much better than Draco, because Draco&#39;s so anti-Muggle, and at least Ron&#39;s used to it from his dad.  It just felt like gratuitous Ron-bashing.  And why Draco, of all characters?  Why not have him sit with Hermione?<br><br>I kept wanting to shake Not-Harry when he was claiming that the entire wizarding world must be stupid and backwards because they haven&#39;t figured out how magic works.  I dearly hope that at some point he discovers that magic can&#39;t be scientifically explained because it simply isn&#39;t rational, but I sincerely doubt that will ever happen.<br><br>Also, why does one of his last names have to be Verres?  I kept on expecting it to be an El Goonish Shive crossover.</p>

            <p>The writing is wonderful, and the world-building is <i>brilliant</i>, but... I just couldn&#39;t get into HPMoR.  In fact, I did mostly the same thing you did.  Several of my friends really, really like it, and so I decided to try it out, but... after only a few chapters, I really didn&#39;t like Harry, and somewhere between chapters 6 and 10 (I don&#39;t quite remember when), I just gave up in disgust.  I just couldn&#39;t stand it anymore.  Rationalist!Harry just has this super stuck-up, condescending attitude of &quot;I am so much better than you in every way&quot; and everyone else has a sort of background acceptance &quot;yes, you are better than us in every way.&quot;  I <i>despise</i> people like that in real life, so I don&#39;t want to read about them, either - especially when I liked the original Harry so much.<br><br>&quot;Luminosity,&quot; the Twilight one with rationalist!Bella, was the same way for me.  I actually enjoyed it at first - pretty much any change you make to Bella Swan&#39;s &quot;personality&quot; will be an improvement - but after I while I couldn&#39;t stand even that either, for the same reasons.  She was just so pretentious and stuck-up and acted as though being a rationalist automatically made her just <i>better</i> than anyone else.<br><br>And that can make a good character, sure.  But not a main character that I&#39;m expected to sympathize with.<br><br><br>I still agree that they&#39;re both very, very good fics.  I personally just can&#39;t stand them.</p>

            <p>I, um, actaully quite like HPMoR. It&#39;s one of my favorite Potterfics.<br><br>Yes, Harry Not-Potter is not exactly the most likeable or nice characters. This does not actually make him a /bad/ character. Yes, he is a bit of a Stu- especially compared to the original Harry- but then again, the power levels of the villains do seem to have been upped accordingly, and Harry does actually have a good characterization. <br><br>Plus, the premise and plot surrounding it is actually /interesting/, and that excuses a lot of things. It&#39;s how Verne was able to get away with pages and pages of tech description and lists of fish in 20K Leagues, for instance. It helps if the world being revealed through such exposition is interesting, and I actually really like the what-if-everybody-in-HP-wasn&#39;t-holding-the-idiot-ball concept. <br><br>On the other hand, when I browse other Potter boards that discuss this fic, <i>everybody</i> hates it, so maybe I&#39;m just missing something. </p>

            <p>I mean, yes, Harry&#39;s personality change is rather drastic. But the plot more than excuses it, I think. And he&#39;s not that Stuish, in my opinion, since he DOES have flaws, and there&#39;s at least one thing that he is very, very wrong about. </p>

            <p>I can see that he could be consider Stuish and sorry, he doesn&#39;t get any better. In fact it probably gets worse. However, the point of the AU was: what if Harry really wanted to ask questions. The author did go a bit overboard with the increased intelligence, but there is a reasonably good bit about Hermione later on.<br>I have a &#39;problem&#39; with heroes as it is and I think I liked the idea of an intelligent anti-hero.

            <p>Right, so in the Harry Potter continuum it is against canon to transfigure foods, but occasionally this happens in badfic. I recently saw one which had a thirteen year old transfigure pumpkin juice into alcoholic chocolate milk for his eleven year old sisters.<br>My question is: What would happen if you added bleeprin to the pumpkin juice right before the spell was cast? Would the bleeprin be transfigured along with the pumpkin juice? If not, would the resulting concoction explode?</p>

            <p>It would probably depend on how specific the spell was, if the spell was &#39;turn the pumpkin juice into alcoholic chocolate milk&#39; then any Bleeprin that was also in the glass (or whatever container it was in) would remain unaffected, and react accordingly when it suddenly becomes immersed in alcohol.<br><br>If the spell was &#39;turn the contents of that glass into alcoholic chocolate milk&#39; then any Bleeprin that was already in there would get transfigured at the same time as the pumpkin juice, and so wouldn&#39;t react. <br><br>I currently don&#39;t have my books, so I can&#39;t check this, but my impression of the magic in <i>Harry Potter</i> was always that the spells were very restrictive in what they did, and that any major changes (such as the starting form of an object to be transfigured) would require a different spell. That being the case, I would expect the spell you mentioned to specifically target &#39;pumpkin juice&#39;, so yeah, any Bleeprin that gets snuck in first would result in an explosion, although it probably wouldn&#39;t be that big.<br><br>As a note, I believe that &#39;Bleeprin&#39; should always be capitalised.<br></p>

            <p>Hi guys, I&#39;m new here and popped in your IRC. Seems like a nice place so I&#39;m happy making a thread saying here I am please pay attention to me ;).<br><br>What I&#39;m a fan of are most urban fantasy novels (Dresden Files, Hollows series etc), Pokemon, Harry Potter, Resident Evil and Devil May Cry. There are others but those are the main ones. Not in any particular order either.<br><br>As for fanfiction I prefer ones that are in a setting I like obviously, I also have a weird fascination with the more... unique fics out there, some of the fetishes those people are just hilarious. The ones that just make me think &quot;What the hell am I reading?&quot; are good entertainment too. There&#39;s also a part of me that sees fics being taken off FF.net as a challenge for me to hunt them down and read them.<br><br>I have dabbled in writing fanfiction, there&#39;s always been that block of being afraid to publish something I&#39;ve put so much work into because maybe I&#39;m the only person who doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s absolute garbage but eh I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get over that :). </p>

            <p>Thanks mate, I&#39;d already found the Wiki and rules too :). In the event of my becoming an evil overlord (or, less likely, a child under three) I cannot make any promises to return your Magic Generator Box however. I thank you for easing my conquest of this world.</p>

            <p>Ah, so after a week of absence I missed a whole stack of messages? Oh dear, I think I&#39;m too lazy to find the badfic thread now. It&#39;s gone pretty long anyway.<br><br>I found a Gary, who teleported from the US into the Star Wars Universe. Almost all of the females he met were attracted to him almost immediately! Especially Barriss, who has gone terribly OOC in this fanfic.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8191072/1/New_Universe_New_Problems"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8191072/1/New_Universe_New_Problems">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8191072/1/New_Universe_New_Problems</a></a><br><br>I suspect the Gary Stu, Aaron, is a failed Author Self-Insert. He&#39;s clearly a Gary to me, with the lack of characterization and obvious Stu traits (such as attracting FIVE JEDI FEMALES at once and escaping a bar brawl so easily).
