            <p>Okay, I&#39;m slowly working on possible ideas for my agents, and I was wondering about a few things.<br><br>My idea was to have an agent who had been saved from a (non-existent) +Anima badfic. He would have been a bit character, who was supposed to be completely destroyed by a Sue, to show how incredibly strong the Sue was.<br>I was thinking that he could have been saved by Agents by having them swap him out with some inanimate object, however, I can&#39;t think how the Agents would manage to do so without the Sue noticing.<br>So I was wondering, does anyone have any ideas to help me out?</p>

            <p>In the few missions I did, I found that sometimes the Canon is desperate enough to rid itself of Sues that it will alter some things to make it easier for the Agents, such as opening a plothole that a certain character slipped into a few chapters before and dumping them back in the story. Literary convenience, you know. I would imagine this would only occur in heavily strained Canons though, such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Pok√©mon, etc.</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t say that +Anima has as many badfics, due to being a lot less popular than many Canons, however...<br>People who aren&#39;t paying attention when they upload stories on FanFiction will often post them to +Anima by accident. The people who aren&#39;t paying attention are often the ones who aren&#39;t the best at writing, to put it nicely.<br>I think, being flooded with badfics that aren&#39;t in the right section could very well put a lot of strain on the Canon, because of being full of things from other Canons.<br>But I&#39;m wondering now, would that be enough to set off the Canon?</p>

            <p>It might be badfic, but the sections on FF.net are there for organizational purposes. A fic being in the wrong spot doesn&#39;t mean that fic is now fic for the canon that section is for, or that it would affect that canon. </p>

            <p>I remember having great fun sending Narto and Lou up against, uh, <i>Avalon</i>, I think (can&#39;t access GDocs right now, so I can&#39;t <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">check</a>), which was an original fic someone had decided they just <i>had</i> to post on FF.net... in the Silmarillion section.<br><br>Of course, there&#39;s a difference between deliberately doing something wrong and an honest mistake, so this is a thoroughly irrelevant post.

            <p>I love that series. While it doesn&#39;t have a lot of fics, there are some bad ones. I remember one Harry Potter crossover that gives them elemental powers--I should toss that on the Unclaimed List, now that I think of it...<br><br>The canon being flooded COULD do the trick, actually. But that would also probably make the agent-to-be and the agents who were already there warp into one of those misplaced fics. Which could be pretty funny. </p>

I&#39;d quite like to, but it&#39;s difficult to sort out - also Kaitlyn thinks it&#39;s ridiculous, but as long as I don&#39;t mention I want to on a public forum she&#39;s a member of, I should be okay.<br><br>Either of them seem like the sort of thing we&#39;d do at a Gathering (although more so -caching, it&#39;s a bit more local), but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever happened.

            <p>There was a travelbug called Puddles the Duck. He was a rubber duck that wanted to go to places with water. He started his journey in New Jersey. He ended up drowning in the Netherlands because the cache he was in was at the bottom of the river and it got swept away in a storm.

            <p>I&#39;ve been Geocaching since 2001, which is around when it started, and I have to say, I really like it. I&#39;m an avid hiker, so Geocaching kinda gives my walking around a purpose. I&#39;ve seen people get really creative with the caches too; there was one hidden under a fake sprinkler, and I helped my dad make one that looks like a pretty convincing beehive. People have said that they were afraid to go near it.</p>

            <p>But I really like letterboxing, which is a similar idea.  People hide little boxes with stamps and a notepad, then other people follow clues (posted at letterboxing.org) to find the boxes.  They can range from simple directions to devilishly complex puzzles.  Each letterboxer carries their own unique stamp, and when you find the letterbox, you stamp your stamp in the box&#39;s notebook and the box&#39;s stamp in your notebook.</p>

            <p>Oh, yes -- a lot of geocaches are influenced by it; they have clues and such rather than just the coordinates. I think I&#39;ve also noticed a couple listed which are straight combinations - they have coordinates for geocaching, and clues&amp;stamps for letterboxing.

            <p>From my own knowledge, I think that originated on Dartmoor in Devon, England. Supposedly there are some hidden on various tors there - well hidden. I believe the tradition there is to leave a postcard addressed to yourself in the box and to post any of the postcards left there by previous people. Then you go home and see how long it takes to arrive in the post.<br><br>The first ever such letterbox was apparently at Cranmere Pool according to Wikipedia.</p>

            <p>Most excellent!  I especially like the contrast shown between the two teams; FicPsych&#39;s tight-knit group against the bunch of people who met in a bar. :p  Both had some real personality going, which makes it even funnier that members of Physical Therapy&#39;s group kept getting into individual fistfights with the Hardcheesers.<br><br>I do hope the members of BH get a little more into playing as the season goes on.

            <p>So I was thinking that, on this thread, we could share our opinions on issues we find in our favorite fandoms. You know, things that LARGE SWATHES of the fandom seems to constantly get wrong. <br><br>To demonstrate, I&#39;ll share one of mine. <br><br>~~<br>Hetalia: I LOATHE AND DESPISE the tortures that get inflicted on England&#39;s poor character. <br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong: England is my FAVORITE character. In fact, I get a little overprotective of him sometimes, to the detriment of, well, everything. <br>But let&#39;s face it: The fandom tends to turn him into a weak, blushing little textbook tsundere. A princess for America (or France, depending on who&#39;s shipped with whom) to rescue. A stereotypical &#39;uke&#39; who has no real character or force of personality at all.<br><br>THIS IS NOT ENGLAND. <br><br>Let&#39;s review some of the things that England has done, shall we?<br><br>1. The Battle of Britain during WWII. Held off Nazi!Germany, ALL BY HIMSELF, for an age. <br><br>2. The Napoleonic Wars. Successfully allied with Prussia (who&#39;s kind of a loose cannon in Canon) to take down the most powerful military power of the time. Again, pretty much all by himself.<br><br>3. The Industrial Revolution started in England; everybody else basically stole his inventions, though he tried to keep them under lock and key. Not only is he kick-ass, England is *smart*. <br><br>4. Even- yes. The Revolutionary War. If you think about it... it takes guts to go to a foreign land, for more or less ten years, and fight someone you love* every day, for no better reason than &#39;I was ordered to, and I&#39;m going to serve my country.&#39; <br><br>England is strong. England is tough as nails. England is NOT a weak character, physically or mentally, despite the fact that he&#39;s kind of scrawny and mad as a spoon. <br><br>Please stop making him a weakling.<br><br>/rant <br><br>* Whether romantically or platonically, it doesn&#39;t matter. I ship USUK, and I realize I&#39;m in a minority of non-weeb USUK shippers, but... it doesn&#39;t change the thrust of my argument.</p>

            <p>Finding quotations from another fandom in a roleplay or fanfic.

            <p><i>Sherlock Holmes</i>: Dr. Watson being treated as a dunce.  He may not stand up to Holmes in canon, but no one can, minus Mycroft.  It&#39;s partly due to frequent movie portrayals of Watson as an idiot, but fanfic sometimes takes this to extremes.  It should be remembered that Watson is an experienced surgeon, and he served as such in the army prior to <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>.<br><br><i>Kingdom Hearts</i>: Kairi-bashing.  While I&#39;m not a fan of slash, I can&#39;t deny that the close friendship between Sora and Riku makes a relationship between them actually not unlikely.  But too many Sora/Riku fics have to get Kairi out of the boys&#39; way in the most obnoxious way possible.  She&#39;ll either be killed off by Heartless, made out as a rare female Designated Misogynistic Bastard, or just turned into a stupid and clueless shell of a character that makes a bit look fleshed out.  I haven&#39;t seen it as much recently (possibly just because of Kairi&#39;s absence from a lot of recent titles), but early on after KH&#39;s introduction, a lot of authors seemed to see Kairi as a Purity Sue.  But despite being kidnapped throughout most of <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts 2</i>, Kairi is far from a dainty perfect princess.  Her love of Sora allowed her to retain her memory of him during his forced sleep, when nearly everyone else in the multiverse forgot he existed.  In KH2, she risked running away from Axel and a small army of Dusks rather than be taken prisoner; she stood up to Sa√Øx, ready to fight him off despite the impossible odds; finally, she helped Riku fight off a group of Heartless in the Castle That Never Was.<br><br>This last point applies more to fanart than fanfic, but I see it in fics sometimes, too.  The Heartless tend to have very simplified, almost cute, designs, usually mimicking people or an object found in their current surroundings.  They want to blend in, after all, to make heart theft all the easier.  So a Heartless is unlikely to walk around as a huge glowing armored wolf with horns and faerie wings and a dragon tail ending in a giant sword.  That wouldn&#39;t blend in anywhere.  Heartless in human form (as Villain Sues) show up way too often, as well.  Only a single character produced a Heartless that retained his human form, and he was (arguably) a combination of two hearts, both steeped in the powers of darkness, one of whom had been manipulating darkness for decades, since young adulthood.  Not many should be able to imitate that feat.<br><br><i>Halo</i>: Cortana having sex with the Master Chief.  Or anyone.<br><br>Cortana is a hologram.<br><br>That is all.</p>

            <p>Yes. I cannot stand stupid!Watson fics. Misses something that&#39;s obvious to Sherlock, yes. But Watson running around, jumping to stupid conclusions, and generally acting like a moron (especially if it&#39;s so that Sherlock can save him) is just bad.<br><br>There is one person in the Sherlock Holmes universe who is an intellectual equal to Sherlock. It happens to be his brother. (Moriarty was dumb enough to suggest that they settle their differences by wrestling at a waterfall, so original works Moriarty doesn&#39;t quite count; he&#39;s dangerous because he has resources and Sherlock is outnumbered, not smart enough to take Sherlock on his own. Other portrayals he might match up, but you have to do it well.)<br><br>I also hate it when people write Sherlock as having no consideration for Watson at all. Or anything that makes me wonder why the heck the fanficton writer thinks they can share an apartment, if they can&#39;t deal with each other.<br><br>/mini rant. That felt good.</p>

            <p>How many things can I list here hmm... let&#39;s just start with the general ones.<br><br>1) Misquoting<br>In this case I mean a comment or dialogue being attributed to the wrong character but really, copying dialogue from canon is just as bad. Actually, make that anything being attributed to the wrong character. An example that I see way too often is Prussia saying anything about &quot;invading vital regions&quot;. It was Austria who said that in canon and there is no evidence that Prussia has even heard about it yet.<br><br>2) Getting facts from canon incorrect<br>If the fic is not specified as a full AU, every rule from the canon MUST apply. You cannot just ignore a character or an established event. In Hetalia this becomes bad history. Any facts that are common knowledge or you can check on Wikipedia should not be skewed in the fic. <br><br>3) Predictable  plot-line.<br>Character A has a crush on Character B but won&#39;t/is too shy to admit it. Character B feels the same and  Character C helps get them together. How many fics can you name with this plot? Way too many.<br><br>Now on to particular fanon irritations.<br><br>Hetalia:<br>People PLEASE stop rewriting events that were already portrayed in canon with OOC characters. I can&#39;t tell you how many fics I&#39;ve seen with England and chibi!America where England is some sort of pedophile and/or abusive father. America was not in any way oppressed during his childhood AS WAS SHOWN IN THE ANIME/MANGA. He fought for freedom like a teenager who wants to move out and be an independent person not because England was being a horrible father/older brother figure.<br><br>Another thing, as was mentioned before, none of the characters are really evil. France is somewhat perverted but he isn&#39;t a rapist with no morals. Russia can sometimes be violent but he&#39;s not trying to be mean, he just wants to make friends and can&#39;t understand why people are so scared of him. Each of these characters has depth to them that explains their actions and none of them would be a jerk without a reason.<br><br>Hunger Games<br>Every single fic out there is of an OC who is chosen as tribute. Every. Single. One. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s in the past or an alternate future but they&#39;re all the same. Have some originality people.<br><br>Harry Potter<br>Uncanon pairings. Most series I either don&#39;t bother shipping  people or there are no established pairings but in HP canon is gold. I realizes not everyone feels this way but I really dislike pairings like Harry/Hermione and Draco/Harry. Even the Neville/Luna in the 8th movie irked me because Rowling said herself that Neville married Hannah Abbot. Again, this is just my opinion.<br><br>That&#39;s it for my overly long rant. The gist of it would probably be that canon and creativity are precious gifts that should never be forsaken. Done ranting now.</p>

            <p>This one crops in a lot of my favorite fandoms. Bad Medicine (and not the Bon Jovi kind). NCIS: Ducky is not going to see someone in urgent need of emergency medical care and decide to treat them at Gibbs&#39; house because they, in an lowered state of consciousness, say they don&#39;t like hospitals!<br><br>Stargate Atlantis: Carson Beckett is not an idiot! He&#39;s not going to miss the fact that someone is starving to death in front of him, and Sheppard is NOT anorexic! The guy has a slim build. That doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t eat. Him being somewhat of a self-sacrificing idiot when it comes to his own health is a kind of justified by canon, but only in extreme cases of danger to others--not because he just doesn&#39;t like doctors.<br><br>Stargate SG-1: I know there isn&#39;t that much fanfic out there that involves Jonas, but there are some horribly bad, nearly universal trends in what does exist. Firstly, Jack&#39;s character gets run through the moral shredder in these fics. Yeah, he didn&#39;t really like Jonas, especially at first. He didn&#39;t trust him because Jonas had switched sides, and he was pissed that Daniel died because Jonas was too scared to go in the room full of deadly radiation. This does not translate to Jack attempting to murder Jonas, Jack beating Jonas up, Jack knowing about other Random Military Types hazing or otherwise hurting Jonas, and it especially doesn&#39;t mean that Jack is going to do something sexual to Jonas. I mean, these authors really don&#39;t seem to get it that not only are they destroying all canon characteristics of Jonas, they are also destroying Jack&#39;s character.<br><br>Then you&#39;ve got Daniel. He&#39;s not an uke. He&#39;s not a wimp. He&#39;s not girly. He most definitely does not walk around crying every five minutes. If anything the guy should be a ticking time bomb for going postal, because the canon puts him through enough stuff to make ten people go off the deep-end, and he rarely expresses any of it. He does occasionally, but even then it is almost always a direct &quot;Aliens Made Them Do It&quot; case where something was influencing his behavior.<br><br>Psych: Canon!Henry is frequently obnoxious, and anyone that raises their kid like that is at least a bit twisted, but he&#39;s not a mindless screaming machine. The things he gripes about on the show make sense, at least under Henry Spencer logic, and they should therefore make sense in fanfic. He doesn&#39;t just come up with completely random stuff. It has a theme every time (and usually an underlying, &quot;I want to see my kid, but can&#39;t just tell him I want to see him, and therefore must make an excuse of wanting the garage cleaned out.&quot; or &quot;My kid is terrifying me that he is going to get himself hurt or killed, and I am going to yell at him because of my terror.&quot;)</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see--<br><br>Madoka:<br><br>Fanfics that screw up Kyubey. Yes, he is probably the most hated character on the show, and for good reason--he does trick teenage girls into selling their souls and becoming monsters. BUT, the thing that fanfic writers don&#39;t seem to get is that in his mind, he is the good guy. He&#39;s not doing it for the evulz, but because he thinks it helps the universe. Amoral and manipulative? Yes. Stupid or blatantly sadistic? Well... No, since sadism implies it&#39;s for your own pleasure. It&#39;s his job, and he doesn&#39;t even have the emotions to feel pleasure with. I think the best Kyubey I&#39;ve read is from the goodfic &#39;A History of Magic&#39; since it really doesn&#39;t make him pure evil, and goes into depth with his character--sorta, unlike other plagiarising authors I could mention... Anyways, moving on.<br><br>Avengers:<br>Loki. He does not mope, he does not whine, he is not a wimp. He, unlike Kyubey,actually takes pleasure from tearing people apart psychologically (related note: it is not freaking fair that he can have a puppy-dog face when doing the psyche-destroying stuff. Curse you, Hiddlestone...) But! He is not boyfriend material. He is a mass-murderer. The twain should not overlap.<br><br>Makeover fics: Just... any fandom. Usually the characters are plenty pretty already, and giving them makeup or goth clothing is... unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Neville/Luna. I&#39;ve just never liked this pairing, but before the seventh book came out, I was certain it was inevitable canon. After the seventh book came out, I felt slightly justified. Then the eighth movie came out and promptly went to the very bottom of my list of the books and movies in order of preference.<br>Neville and Luna are awesome, I just think they can be awesome and not a couple. I always saw Neville as slightly intimidated by Luna, but becoming close friends after <i> Deathly Hallows</i>. However, I&#39;m really not sure why I hate this pairing so much, I&#39;m sure it can be written well, maybe I&#39;m just missing something.</p>

They&#39;re all friends who&#39;ve faced severe danger together, and that has proven to be, in the end, a bond far stronger than teenage romances and fallings-out.<br><br>My ultimate peeve with that type of fic, though, is the way Hermione is so often transformed into a weepy, clingy, fragile girl who needs Harry to save her from everything. That&#39;s just a &quot;HELL no&quot; from me. She is one of my favourite heroines because she is brilliant, loyal and able to take care of herself and on occasion the people around her. Very often, her smarts are the only way to actually reach and overcome the final challenge each year. She&#39;s also an extremely capable fighter; at the age of sixteen she was taking on Death Eaters in the Ministry and by the time she was eighteen she was able, with the help of Ginny and Luna, to take on Bellatrix Lestrange, one of the most terrifyingly able duellists around. In short: she does <i>not</i> need anyone to protect her in case she scratches her finger.<br><br>And now I shall stop here before I detail every single peeve with the Potterverse and this ends up taking three posts. :P</p>

            <p>How about alphabetically?<br><br>AVENGERS<br><br>--Yes, Thor is a little goofy sometimes. He doesn&#39;t understand much of our world, and he comes from a realm that&#39;s basically Magical Techno-Viking. And he cares about his brother beyond the point of rationality. <br><br>However, this does NOT mean that Thor is:<br><br>1) Stupid;<br>2) Very stupid;<br>3) Naive;<br>4) Very very mind-meltingly stupid;<br>or 5) all of the above.<br><br>I get that he&#39;s almost the God of Golden Retrievers in some ways. When he&#39;s mugging for Darcy&#39;s camera or telling people how tiny they are, you kind of want to tousle his hair and feed him Pop Tarts. But he&#39;s also the God of Thunder, and wields a weapon that nobody else--not even the Hulk--can lift. He walked right up to the king of Jotunheim with only a half-dozen people as backup, because he wanted to pick a fight. He went mano-a-mano with the aforementioned Hulk. Not knowing how Midgard works does not make him <i>stupid</i>. Seriously, guys. Viking god. &#39;Nuff said.<br><br>BATMAN<br><br>Fanwriters never seem to know the difference between riddles and jokes. Sure, there&#39;s some overlap, but I have seen maybe . . . oh . . . two competently-written Riddlers in my four-plus years in the fandom. The rest of the time, he&#39;s a prancing ninny who tells jokes. Fandom, I am disappoint.<br><br>GI JOE<br><br>--My pet peeves can be summed up with the phrase &quot;elite military unit.&quot; Let&#39;s break it down.<br><br>--&quot;Elite.&quot; The original &#39;80s Joes were in their thirties, Vietnam veterans, and handpicked from the very best that the army and associated branches and specialties had to offer. You don&#39;t get to be a Joe unless you have high-level specialized training, or have an unusual skillset that makes you invaluable (IE, ninja). They don&#39;t just pick anyone who manages to vaguely impress one of their members. Sues, I&#39;m looking at you.<br><br>--&quot;Military.&quot; Yes, they&#39;re a mixed group, but they still live the military life and under military regulations. That means: communal bunkrooms, keeping personal possessions to a minimum, up at the crack of dawn for PT, no talking back to someone of higher rank or else, do as you&#39;re told, lots of hard work, and pulling nightshifts on CQ or guard duty. A lot of those things suck, but it&#39;s the job. An OC cannot just mouth off to anyone she likes, and she can&#39;t decide she doesn&#39;t want to do something--especially not when ordered by a superior officer.<br><br>--&quot;Unit.&quot; They are a team, dang it. They have to work together. There&#39;s always going to be interpersonal drama, but not at the high-school level that fics seem to like. They&#39;re grownups, guys! War veterans! Give them a teensy bit of credit.<br><br></p>

            <p>Hetalia:<br><br>Poland:<br>I&#39;ve seen a ton of people make Poland into a selfish girl obsessed with what he looks like, ponies, pink, and all that stuff. Yes he does like that, but no, he is not incapable of taking care of himself. Look at history. He&#39;s known as the phoenix, and he&#39;s earned that nickname. Look at how many times he&#39;s been dissolved. Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1795. By Germany and the USSR in 1939. I think that all of his quirks are just a coping mechanism. He&#39;s a strong country on his own.<br><br>Canada:<br>Please note that Canada is my favorite character, so I may be a little biased when it comes to him.<br><br>In a lot of stories I&#39;ve seen, Canada is portrayed as a character who is just there, is meek and afraid to make himself known. Look at Canadian history, particularly during World War Two, where the majority of Hetalia Canon takes place, and it tells a different story. On D-Day, the Canadians had gotten the farthest into France of the three attacking nations. A quote from Winston Churchill states that in the army needed to take over the world, the soldiers would be Canadian. I don&#39;t think Canada would let Russia sit on him.</p>

            <p>People either forgetting Canada or making him a total pushover is one of my huge pet peeves. Invisibility is not his only characteristic, but it seems to be the only one that sticks in some people&#39;s minds. As for being a pushover, remember the strip where he gave America a three hour long lecture about everything that was bad about him? And he only stopped because England told him to.<br>TL:DR- Canada is in no way a pushover.</p>

            <p>I kind of think Canada has a power like the Invisible Boy&#39;s, from Mystery Men. As in, he&#39;s invisible, but only when someone&#39;s watching. He&#39;s not the happiest about this, but it lets him get things DONE that America can&#39;t do.<br><br>And Poland has got to be one of my FAVORITE characters in Hetalia. He always keeps his chin up, no matter what&#39;s going on. England envies him his stiff upper lip, a little.</p>

            <p>&#39;Scuse me, let me finish packing this crate with these individually wrapped bars of something about right to hold in the palm of your hand...<br><br>... Okay, done. -stands on it-<br><br>I am so utterly sick of stories where Matoran Universe inhabitants date and marry and have babies like humans do without even a cursory note that the author is disregarding that particular piece of canon. I am so utterly sick of this assumption that of <i>course</i> they need to kiss and date and marry and have sex and <i>court like humans do</i> when that disregards a fundamental difference which is that <i>they don&#39;t</i>.<br><br>They&#39;re asexual -- not agender, much as I am liable to grumble about how that doesn&#39;t make sense except as something the Great Beings couldn&#39;t imagine their creations <i>not</i> having -- and don&#39;t even have the <i>bits</i> for sex, just the mental construct of female/male and slightly different bodies with their different elements (hello Ga-Matoran, how ya doing with those useless lumps on your chests?). They&#39;re still entirely capable of forging deep and abiding friendships, especially without the whole issue wherein a hetero- or bisexual male and a hetero- or bisexual female form a deep and abiding friendship and the world and his wife expects them to hop into bed together.<br><br>Co-opting the words &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;sister&quot; for what Toa call their teammates, I feel, sums this sort of relationship up neatly. It&#39;s entirely platonic, it&#39;s entirely non-erotic, and the participants will go through hell and high water for each other and rib their siblings about it the whole way, and they <i>chose</i> their family on top. They <i>love</i> each other, and I really wish English didn&#39;t have sex all tangled up in that word because in canon Bionicle they <i>don&#39;t</i> and it&#39;s kind of beautiful. They make sure those they love are safe and happy and healthy and will lay down their lives to do it (See: Jaller that one time to save Takua, Matoro for freaking EVERYBODY) and they don&#39;t <i>need</i> the whole sex thing tangled up in their love. Physical closeness? Hell yeah, hugging is all up in this joint, cuddling for comfort after or before a big battle <i>eff</i> yes, just don&#39;t get your sexual-being baggage into their asexual-being love.<br><br>... Okay, and Greg Farshtey didn&#39;t want to answer questions about the sex lives of plastic toys. That too. I just took the whole thing and ran with it, though I&#39;m poking at the idea of romantic as opposed to erotic love and seeing if it&#39;s disentanglable from the whole &#39;kissing&#39; thing because I think it&#39;s applicable to my questionably-canon-compliant headcanon AKA that meandering rant. And I really, really find this sort of thing, this difference in mentality, interesting, and I want to see what I think makes <i>sense...</i><br><br>Still got one more, related to the above: Oi! Enough with the unmarked giving of human forms for the sole reason of <i>teh sexhay</i>. I&#39;m annoyed about the proliferation of these period because there&#39;s often no real reason beyond the author seemingly unable to properly imagine not being human, but if they&#39;re marked I can avoid them or in the case of <i>Metru Uni</i> love them, though that one&#39;s A, marked, and B, not for <i>teh sexhay</i> anyway and it&#39;s actually more like <i>humans</i> getting these weird powers and masks and stuff, it&#39;s awesome. And also horrendously AU even beyond that but the timeline changes are the funnest.<br><br>A-hm, where was I? Oh yes. It&#39;s not that hard to write these guys as the bodies they are in canon, really! <i>Really!</i> Just get your minds out of the gutter for two darn sexonds* and you&#39;ll see they don&#39;t even <i>need</i> to be human because canon did <i>just fine</i>, and anyway you can always turn to the natives of Spherus Magna if you <i>really</i> wanna, they&#39;ve got the equipment... or <i>mark</i> your dang AUs at least so I can avoid them just off the summary, ff.net&#39;s summary limit is 384 character now instead of 255, you have <i>space</i>! At the <i>very</i> least put it in an initial author&#39;s note.<br><br>*Typo. But I&#39;m keeping it, because, despite what that rant extolling asexuality might lead people to believe, I&#39;m as horny a teenager as the majority of sixteen-year-olds. I just... don&#39;t think giving that particular trait to these characters adds anything, and that they have so many more ways to show love that won&#39;t even need to go over G unless you&#39;re the kind of person who thinks guys cuddling needs an R rating and then screw you Takua/Jaller cuddlebuddies for life! No, no, Nixie/Takua/Jaller/Hahli OT4 cuddlepairing! And add Macku and Hewkii to Hahli&#39;s end of the couch in that order, and get Hafu in there! Maybe get Pohatu to give Kopaka and Tahu a hug wherein they&#39;re stuck next to each other, see how much the pair grumbles! CUDDLES FOR EVERYONE<br><br>HUGS FOR THE HUG THRONE CUDDLES FOR THE CUDDLE GOD ahem I&#39;ll be going now -steps down off soapbox-</p>

            <p>I mean, This Is Hetalia Everything Is Made of Pink Sugar. But with that in mind...<br><br>Russia doesn&#39;t really know how to love. He&#39;s never had a proper family... Well, as in a mother or a father. He&#39;s always had to take care of his sisters, who are completely insane and both chasing him (Ukraine more subtly than Belarus). He&#39;s in a constant war with General Winter, and he&#39;s... just kind of alone. <br>Then he meets the rest of the world and has no idea of how to react. His first impulse is to make sure he doesn&#39;t get hurt. Meaning he, yes, hurts other people, especially if it looks like he or his sisters will get hurt if he doesn&#39;t. His second impulse is to try to make friends. Unfortunately... for Russia, friendship is kind of... elusive, because he tends to hurt people if he thinks they&#39;ll hurt him. And love hurts sometimes.<br><br>tl;dr: Russia is the product of his environment. It&#39;s not his fault, and if he spends more time with normal people, he might get a little better.<br><br>Meanwhile, France loves, and loves all too well. *His* problem is that, well... Everyone he loves tends to leave. Jeanne died, as did Madame de Pompadour. (After seeing that episode with the Doctor, I can&#39;t help but see France in love with her, in the same kind of way.) England left, and never came back. Because of this... he kind of tries to pretend that it really isn&#39;t a big deal. He acts like romance is a game. &quot;Let me love none, no, but the sport.&quot; ...Really, it&#39;s the same sort of reaction England has to the same problem, except that England just tries to escape into fantasy worlds and avoid the L word altogether, while France tries to romance the whole world, so as to forget the dull little ache that&#39;s settled inside him. <br><br>tl:dr; France is an incurable romantic, stuck in a world that hasn&#39;t been kind to him. <br><br>Both kind of tragic characters, really. All they want is love. *sniffles*<br><br></p>

            <p>This more or less summarises why they&#39;re two of my favourite characters, and why it annoys me so much when people ignore all of this. There&#39;s so much potential for great stories that explore their characters, but people will ignore this in favour of using them as evil rapist types for hurt/comfort fics.<br>(The hurt/comfort could also be done well, if they weren&#39;t just written as &quot;France/Russia rapes X Nation because they are a rapist&quot;)</p>

            <p>1) Is Coriander aka V√´on (his badfic name was Choriandus and his recruiters had an ... odd sense of humour) an acceptable name for a Tolkien elf?<br>2) Does HQ get radio?<br>3) Do characters which don&#39;t appear, but are mentioned (not during dialogue) exist and need to be removed/Neuralyzed?<br>4) What exactly are Minis created from? If there was a missing comma before a correctly spelt canon name, would that create an object or a Mini?<br>5) Has anyone chosen Primeval Minis?<br>6) If the answer to five is no, would Mini Colombian Mammoths or Mini Predators be a sensible choice?</p>

<li>Agent Undis Closed of the aforementioned Radio Nutmeg strongly implies that his station is illicit (I think his introduction starts with &#39;Somewhere in the mountains of New Caledonia&#39;). I&#39;ve always imagined him and Gilty Cin (I think that&#39;s right - can&#39;t get to the Wiki right now) hacking their way into a network they&#39;re probably not meant to be on. By this theory, unless it had been modified, a console probably /wouldn&#39;t/ pick up Radio Caroline or whatever. As to whether a normal radio would pick anything up in HQ... that would depend on the radio-transparency of generic surface, and the universe the radio was in at the time (assuming the HQ-is-built-into-caves-via-invisible-portals theory is correct, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been properly tested).<br><br>3. Switching tracks, I would say this depends entirely on what works in the story. If you&#39;d literally just have to write &#39;Agents Carbuncle and Vermillion portalled into Bitticus Karaktor&#39;s room. Vermillion stabbed him. They portalled out&#39;, it&#39;s probably not worth bothering. If, however, the off-screen character is the President of the United States of Valinor, with armies at his disposal, it might be hilarious to watch, and so worth doing.<br><br>(United States of Valinor... oh dear. That&#39;s almost as bad as &#39;and then the Noldor invaded Modern Earth and totally won&#39;)<br><br>hS</li>

            <p>Alice The Walls would definitely be some kind of furniture. You Bob... I dunno.

            <p>Yeah, I think so. Or one that simply floats past the Agents. Really bad cases of punctuation abuse cause Punctuation Downpours, which are exactly that: it&#39;s raining punctuation. It usually hurts. </p>

            <p>OK then. I have recently finished my latest mission, starring Agents Lana and Narav. Many thanks to Data Junkie for beta-ing. However! This mission does contain references to child abuse--nothing NSFB/NSFW, but it is there. <br><br>And, onto the mission:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ELPJWR8MnxfIKn7d6dt-34ewEL_L2MJc0Wbaxo3V0jY/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ELPJWR8MnxfIKn7d6dt-34ewEL_L2MJc0Wbaxo3V0jY/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ELPJWR8MnxfIKn7d6dt-34ewEL_L2MJc0Wbaxo3V0jY/edit</a></a><br><br>Loot:<br>- &#39;Hungry Wines&#39;. It&#39;s probably alcohol that makes you hungry, or that eats items left near it and refills itself through that. Whatever you want, I guess.<br><br>Minis:<br>-water bender (mini-Unagi)<br>-earth bender (mini-Badgermole)<br>-fire bender (mini-dragon)<br>ANd the mini-fire-ferrets:<br>fire ferrets, fireferrets, avatar, probending, probend,and probending arena.</p>

            <p>A most excellent mission!  This is one of those missions where I really feel no sympathy for the Sue at all; she was treating her pet with more attention and care than her own brother!  I&#39;m glad Nathan is under the Nursery&#39;s care, now.<br><br>I liked the scene at the end.  Letting real dragons take care of the imposter was an excellent choice.  Having the Sue Wraith take over her dead pet&#39;s body to attack was, frankly, awesome.<br><br>Now, my traditional and obnoxious Pointing Out Of Errors.<br><br><i>Narav began to swallow Bleeprin as the Sue somehow pulled on the tiny costume, but as her limbs and body warped in order to fit it.</i>  Something&#39;s missing in that second clause.<br><br><i>As the two agents watched, he changed from a toddler to about a thirteen.</i>  Thirteen-year-old.  (I don&#39;t think you intended to turn him into one of those number Muppets from Sesame Street.)<br><br>Your asterisked note of noodle advertisements: It&#39;s a good joke, but I think it would be better either at the end of whole story, or as a parenthetical right in the same paragraph.  It reads really out of place where it is, and I was trying to figure out why an ad had spawned in the middle of a GoogleDoc.<br><br><i>The two OCs had some a few lines of dialogue, before Lexi ran upstairs to dress.</i>  Either some or a few.  Not both.<br><br><i>She had barely noticed the fact that a sentence had ben inserted into the narrative, she was so happy they were almost done.</i>  Pleased to meet Mr. Ben Inserted!<br><br><i>She looked at where he‚Äôd been standing, and wsa shocked.</i> &quot;was&quot;<br><br><i>After we get those, I think that that random alcohol in that bar to set the house on fire.‚Äù</i>  Missing a verb, methinks.</p>

            <p>I especially liked how you managed to convey the information necessary to understand the &#39;verse though the agents&#39; conversations. My only nitpick would be the use of an internet connection to check the rules of pro-bending. Where&#39;s the reception coming from? I remember a Pocket Fictionary being used in a situation like this once. I can&#39;t find any mention of it on the wiki (aside from the Claimed badfic page), but I think it appeared in one of Suicide and Diocletian&#39;s missions...<br><br>Loving that reference to the PPC Card Game.

            <p>Just thought I&#39;d drop in and say hi, since I&#39;ve been lurking for a while on the wiki.  I probably won&#39;t be doing any missions or sporking in the foreseeable future, but I have plans to do plenty of scanning the archives of fanfiction.net for badfic.  So hi, everyone!</p>

            <p>I remember being a lurker once... good times. Not really though because I barely knew what was going on and I was terrified that the Boarders were going to eat me. Not that they would; it&#39;s hard to eat someone over the internet.<br><br>Enough about me; how about you and your brand new action figures! There&#39;s so many things to talk about in that category, like how there are seventeen of them and each of them is a MLP pony with a star symbol thingy (what are they called?)and how they com in all different color combinations.

            <p>I know this seems completely strange, but here me out. I know that text based fanfics are the standard which pretty much every agent goes through, but what about other fan mediums?<br><br>Take, for example, comics.<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HowIBecameYours?from=FanFic.HowIBecameYours"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HowIBecameYours?from=FanFic.HowIBecameYours">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HowIBecameYours?from=FanFic.HowIBecameYours</a></a><br><br>How I Became Yours is pretty much Avatar Badfic in comic form. Reading it... well, I was banging my head, and not to the metal music.<br><br>The one I know we stay away from is fanart. <br><br>I noticed this with many Sonic OC&#39;s online, too. Are we allowed to go after bad fancomics like this?<br><br>FYI, the author of How I Became Yours was banned from deviantart for stealing much of her artwork. <br><br>I do not have permission, by the way. I have been thinking about my (Very unlikely) agents, however.</p>

            <p>Because if you could you could take some scans of the really bad pages and draw the agents on the page fixing things or poking fun at it. Just an idea, but I have seen some bad fanart out there and as someone learning how to draw I feel like that could be something that I could work on. I haven&#39;t applied for Permission yet though, so it wouldn&#39;t be anytime soon.</p>

            <p>What you could do is insert links (for whole scenes) or crops of the page (for the most notable art errors) into a normal text mission.  Misspellings and the like could just be copied like quotes normally are.<br><br>Personally, I think there is value to sporking it even if you do only use text.  That thing is a stinking pile of frass and deserves to die a million fiery deaths.

            <p>Somehow, these drawings strike me as uncanny. I can&#39;t pinpoint it, but I think it&#39;s the fact that the faces are so large. The facial features seem kinda lost in them.<br><br>Also, the varying degree of realism. You&#39;re trying really hard with the eyes while having barely any shading or dynamics. I don&#39;t think a tutorial for facial expression helps that much before you&#39;ve got the face itself down. Start slowly.</p>

            <p>To be honest...

            <p>(If I have been a tactless pillock and/or made dumb blanket statements at any point in this, please inform me. Concrit the concrit, so to speak.)<br><br>As an amateur artist myself, and as an artist who specializes in drawing face both from the front and in profile, I say this: Look at people&#39;s faces. For eye placement, look at people&#39;s faces. Look at tutorials for how to draw the human face written by people who show knowledge of how the body is put together in real life. Eyes are, approximately, in the middle of the head. The &#39;upside-down egg&#39; way of drawing the head from the front is one I&#39;ve found works, as well as drawing a circle and then the jaw. I draw guidelines through the horizontal and vertical middles and it helps keeps things in place. I look at tutorials, I watch tutorials, and I practice imitating what I see.<br><br>Specific crit: you draw eyes too high. Nearly everything else looks about right, but the misplaced eyes are the center of focus and they make the whole image look off. The eyebrows do look right, they&#39;re at about the height of the top of the ears, but the eyes are squeezed in under them.<br><br>You also draw mouths too wide to be quite right; the general rule of thumb I&#39;ve picked up is that the very edges of the mouth fall squarely under the middle of the pupil when the eyes are facing straight forward, they actually <i>look</i> a bit smaller, and in more stylized styles mouths are often smaller still.<br><br>I say again, look at people and draw them, look at tutorials and imitate the general principles, and do what you&#39;re already doing and practice.</p>

            <p>Well. It&#39;s not the one I learned the most basic basic basics from, that was something that&#39;s been eaten by the Internet or I&#39;d show it to you. I found it useful for the simplified ways of drawing the body... Really all I can say is look at people, look at the general proportions of their faces, and practice practice practice. And remember: the eyes are in the middle of the head! Oh and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/markcrilley">Mark Crilley</a> has some pretty good video tutorials on how to draw things, in a more stylized style than what you seem to be trying for but the general principles of where things go on the face are the same no matter what style you eventually go for and he does do more realistic art styles when his subscribers request it.<br><br>Hee.</p>

            <p>Hrmm. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never tried to draw a character as a specific anything, just drew what came out of my pencil and then categorized them (or not) once I&#39;ve solidified what they look like... I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re saying here, but from the words you&#39;ve written my advice is to just draw Miss Williams the way that looks like it&#39;s her, and if that happens to fit with a certain face model then cool, and if it doesn&#39;t, oh well.</p>

            <p>The original thread is beginning to sink with all these new ones popping up, and that&#39;s caused a lack of commenting on it and new additions and/or changes, so please forgive me, SeaTurtle, for snagging your thread and popping it up top here. <br><br>I made a few minor changes to the last version that was made by AstralVoid:<br><br>1. Discrimination and persecution of any kind will not be tolerated, especially on the basis of sexism, racism, ableism, nationalism, homophobia, transphobia, or religion. We will not tolerate individual people or groups who intentionally oppress, persecute, other, use or otherwise attack others in any way, shape or form, for any reason.<br><br>2. Do not flame. There is a distinct difference between &#39;I don&#39;t agree with your opinion and I think that your theory is factually wrong&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re an idiot and your opinion is built on lies and stupidity&#39;. If you find that you&#39;re hurling insults around, just stop. In addition, we don&#39;t tolerate anyone making jokes about topics like rape, murder, abuse, bigotry and mental health issues.<br><br>3: People engaged in any of the above will be given at least one actual chance to stop and apologise. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance. Giving someone a chance means informing them their behavior is wrong or unwanted as according to our Constitution and why, as per Rule 7. <br><br>4: All respectful opinions that do not attack, insult, or persecute others (see 1) are welcome. We encourage respectful, friendly debates here. Should a debate escalate into an argument for any reason, everyone involved should step back and calm down before continuing. If this cannot be done, it may be best to abandon the conversation entirely.<br><br>5: If someone says something that seems offensive, but you‚Äôre not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren‚Äôt out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you‚Äôll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant- it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts.<br><br>6: If you find it impossible to get along with another member of the PPC, please take it up in private e-mail. However, the rules of civility and respect do not end off the Board; harassing others by private means is just as serious as harassing them in public- if not more so, and will be treated as such. Don‚Äôt engage in bullying behaviour, and don‚Äôt say anything about another PPCer you wouldn‚Äôt say to their face. Remember, if you have to ask yourself if you‚Äôve gone too far, you probably have. Everyone should do their best to be as civil as possible while on the Board.<br><br>7: The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If you see someone breaking any of the rules and guidelines herein, please ask them to stop (politely, though) and explain why. If this doesn&#39;t resolve the situation, you will be backed up - and if it continues, a persistent rule-breaker should be shunned or asked to leave the Board. (If you&#39;re being accused of breaking a rule, take a step back and, if you are in the wrong, stop, apologise, and move on. Grudges are no fun!)<br><br>8: Everyone on the Board should be respected as people, regardless of who they are. The opinions of a newbie are just as valid and wanted as those of someone here for four years. Everyone deserves respect until they show themselves to be unashamedly disrespectful themselves, which means people who show disrespect and discrimination as per Rule 1 do not warrant respect based on those views. This does not mean you are allowed to descend into flaming and insulting them, but instead should follow Rule 7. <br><br>9: All discovered mimes will be thrown into a pit, which may or may not be filled with various objects such as scorpions upon their availability.<br><br>9.5: There will be no clemency for these mimes until they learn the words.<br><br><br><br><br>Thoughts, changes, or agreement that we&#39;ve reached something suitable would be a great idea so we can get this all sorted out, sooner than later, yeah?</p>

            <p>Have you read through the multiple discussion threads we&#39;ve had on this? You are essentially advocating a hands-off approach where we let bigots off the hook for being bigots. Intolerance needs to be called out or it will breed and fester. We need to say, without equivocation or hesitation, that they are wrong. It&#39;s not because we&#39;re trying to beat  them in an argument, it&#39;s to establish an environment where bigotry is unacceptable and frowned upon. Bigotry is not a victimless crime.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what to make of your last sentence. I suppose it&#39;s an insult. But it&#39;s a well deserved one, e.g. in Jacer&#39;s case. I will call a spade a spade.</p>

            <p>Yes, I read through the discussion threads, and I disagree with some of it. I was just checking to see if the new Constitution was going to go through. <br><br>No, I thought we would just tell everyone the discussion was unproductive and move on.

            <p>I don&#39;t agree with everything Artell&#39;s said on this thread, or even everything that&#39;s been said on this thread (and others) in general, so I&#39;m only speaking for myself, here.<br><br>Neshomeh and Phobos, I believe, are correct in thinking that there&#39;s a tendency at the moment to assume the worst in comments that you disagree with. I think the only way to combat this is to communicate as clearly as we possibly can, especially on issues of sensitivity, such as this one. So I&#39;m going to try and be as clear as I know how.<br><br><i>Did someone say that the rule &quot;Don&#39;t tell other people their opinions are wrong&quot; is a shield for bullies?<br><br>I don&#39;t think it is. Can&#39;t you tell a bully to not bully without addressing the rightness of either his/her or the victim&#39;s opinion? Can&#39;t you just say, &quot;Nobody&#39;s going to win; let&#39;s just stop now; this subject is off the Board; please keep it there&quot;?</i><br><br>See, this creates a few issues. The first issue is that sometimes, expressing an opinion is a way of bullying. I think I addressed this somewhere down the line, and I&#39;m sure others have as well. For example, someone may have a personal opinion, held with great conviction, that Latter Day Saints are a terrible, evil cult, and their religion should be illegal. This is an opinion that is incredibly bullying to the LDS PPCers. However, you are right in that nobody can, with any effectiveness, really go &quot;That opinion is wrong!&quot; We all know how that one ends; when you tell someone their opinion is wrong, in almost all cases, they double down and things get ugly.<br><br>But what <i>is</i> a valid response is &quot;That opinion is bigoted, by way of marginalizing a group of people based on their religion, and you shouldn&#39;t be expressing it here.&quot;<br><br>I will try to be as clear as I can here, one of the very few places where I can speak with certainty. When someone is being a bully and a bigot, when their behavior is harming others, it is not wrong to tell them. There are a series of videos that went around the web some time ago about telling people their behavior was a problem without insulting them. As in, there&#39;s a difference between &quot;That joke you just made was racist,&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re a racist.&quot;<br><br>And this is where the &quot;Chance to apologize/back off&quot; part comes in. The difference between someone being a bully and engaging in bullying optionis is what happens next. For example:<br><br>Person A: Catholics and Canadians are terrible people!<br>Person B: Wow, that&#39;s really a pretty offensive thing to say. [Links to Constitution] Can you please not say stuff like this here?<br><br>Person A has some options, here, and they can be broken down into three basic scenarios. One, there is no response, and the thread drops off the Board. That&#39;s not ideal, but it&#39;s not a bad way to let things go. The other two are basically as follows:<br><br>Scenario 1:<br>Person A: But it&#39;s just my opinion! My religion is opposed to Catholicism, and you can&#39;t tell me what to believe! And being Canadian is objectively sinful and wrong!<br><br>Person B: ...Yeah, see, we have Catholics and Canadians on this Board, and you&#39;re being really rude and cruel to them. If you don&#39;t stop, you will be asked to leave.<br><br>This is an example of What Not To Do.<br><br>Scenario 2:<br>Person A: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to be offensive to anyone, it&#39;s just a private belief. I&#39;ll keep that rule in mind in the future.<br><br>This is the way to respond. If Person A wants to continue discussing, after they have apologized, they should be very careful. But it&#39;s not a silencing tactic, it&#39;s a means to keep people from attacking and hurting others.<br><br>Do you understand what I mean, here?</p>

            <p>I apologize for not realizing this. I posted without the usual amount of proofreading, due to various amounts of stress and time-lacking. I should add - two things, actually.<br><br>First: We&#39;re all intelligent people here, and people who, I gather, somewhat value intelligence. If someone&#39;s opinion is clearly, subjectively <i>wrong</i>, they might double down and gnash their teeth, but that shouldn&#39;t... factual inaccuracies are not things to argue about. The Church of Latter Day Saints is not an evil cult, and Catholicism is not an evil cult, and being LGBT is not a choice. Things like sin, ethics, morals, squick-threshholds, etc... those are subjective, and rather more applicable to the post above this one. Person B would&#39;ve been well within their rights to go &quot;That&#39;s really offensive, [Link], please don&#39;t say that, also it&#39;s completely incorrect, and here is factual evidence to that effect.&quot;<br><br>Second: This bothered me the first time I read your post, but being short on time, I left it out. I would like to say it here, though.<br><br>Calling someone a bigot may be insulting. It may be insulting even if it&#39;s true. But quite frankly, if someone says something bigoted, insists they&#39;ve done nothing wrong, and actively bullies people based on their sexual orientation, race, gender, religion, etc, they are being a bigot. I think if this is the case, if someone refuses to acknowledge that their behavior is harming others and bigoted, it&#39;s rather more important that we be accurate than that we be sensitive.</p>

            <p>First off, we would like to say that we approve of the proposed amendments.  We think that the changes are needed.<br><br>However, that is not what we want to talk about right now.  We are concerned about some of the discourse taking place around the amendments.  We have seen a pattern of behavior that disturbs us, in this thread and its predecessor.  People&#39;s concerns about the amendment have been met with hostility, excuses, avoidance, and minimization.  Let us give some examples.<br><br>1) Tungsten Monk raised legitimate concerns about the very open-ended language being used in the original post of the first thread.  Her point was met with several responses which ranged from &quot;We aren&#39;t mature adults&quot; (excuses) and &quot;You would rather see people leave than change the rules a little?&quot; (avoidance) to &quot;We&#39;ve already set a terrible precedent&quot; (excuses).  None of these actually addressed her concerns about the language.<br><br>2) Kaitlyn voiced a concern about potential vigilante-ism and was told &quot;That won&#39;t be a problem, because we already have the opposite problem&quot; (minimization). <br><br>3) VM says she assumed that StarShadow was worried that homophobia wouldn&#39;t be tolerated, despite him clearly saying, in his original post to this thread, that he thinks the amendment &quot;Seems good&quot;.  This is not the only time, in the recent past, that people have been accused of supporting/opposing something, when they had already stated that they hold the opposite view (hostility).<br><br>What all of this boils down to, in our opinion, is an automatic assumption of bad faith.  It looks like an assumption that any concerns that are brought up are supporting the bad guys, so the concerns are being shouted down or not treated seriously.  We are worried that this will continue into the future.<br><br>We believe that this is important.  We would like to have a discussion about why this is happening and how we can fix it.<br><br>-Phobos and Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Please allow me to explain, from my point of view, why I see the criticisms of the criticisms as valid.<br><br>1) Refers to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=227897;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a> post, I believe.  While open-ended language can indeed be an issue, that&#39;s not the point at the moment.  From what I get, most of the arguments and issues with Tungsten&#39;s post come from this paragraph here:<br><br><i>&quot;Putting this kind of thing in the Constitution sets a dangerous precedent. I move that rather than amending our rules, we deal with these things on a case-by-case basis. We&#39;re mature adults, for God&#39;s sake, and if people have a problem with each other then they can settle it like adults.&quot;</i><br><br>Well, this is where the &quot;we aren&#39;t mature adults&quot; argument comes in.  Go down and look at Tray&#39;s post.  Look at the drama that unfolded with Jacer and Tray leaving.  Then come back and tell me that that was handled in a mature manner.  I am getting tired of reiterating this, but it seems I have to one more time: <b>A bigot was defended by people in this community after she caused another good, hardworking member of our community to have such mental anguish that he tried to kill himself.</b>  Apparently without something reminding us to not be dicks, we can&#39;t &quot;settle it like adults.&quot;  We are not mature people when that happens.  This <i>is</i> a terrible precedent to set and we as a community should be ashamed to have let it happen.<br><br>As for the argument you labeled as avoidance... well yes, in this case, I would rather change the rules than have someone like Tray leave.  And pretty much everyone else who spoke up and stated they would too if Jacer&#39;s presence was given further tolerance.<br><br><i>&quot;Yes, we may lose some members. But that&#39;s always going to happen: people disagree. I&#39;d much prefer that to a board where a ban on &quot;diffusion of harmful opinions&quot; is in force.&quot;</i><br><br>There is people disagreeing about plots and character arcs, and whether one should use an Oxford comma or not, and then there is someone who believe that it is her purpose, nay, her <i>God-given duty</i> to go around telling people that they&#39;re sinners because of the way they were born.  That they&#39;re disgusting.  That they are sub-human monstrosities.  That the way she believes is the way things should be for all.<br><br>To paraphrase an actual decent person: &quot;To tolerate intolerance is to breed intolerance.&quot;<br><br>2) Going off <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=227884;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a> post.  Here are my issues with it.<br><br><i>&quot;At the same time, it would be great if we didn&#39;t develop a vigilante culture where people are not permitted to move on from past mistakes after acknowledging and correcting them.&quot;</i><br><br>Well, aside from the fact that the PPC has the tendency to not actually have mods and has survived by everyone sort of glaring at the wrongdoer?  Except in larger, drama-filled cases, apparently?<br><br>Please, show me anywhere that Jacer ever showed any sign of remorse for what she was saying and doing.  She didn&#39;t.  Never did she apologize or show any sign of sorrow for the pain and hatred she spread.<br><br><i>&quot;If they&#39;d instead gone all SOCIAL-JUSTICE-WARRIOR-HULK-SMASH, it would have been a much more lonely and painful process, and I wouldn&#39;t have had anywhere safe to land after completing it. It feels good to dispense the fire of righteous justice from above, but when it&#39;s dispensed indiscriminately, people who are genuinely trying to do better have nowhere to do it.&quot;</i><br><br>Well yes, this.  Jacer showed us the effects of raining her own version of righteous justice down on a pretty large portion of our community.<br><br>Yeah, if someone shows signs of bigotry, do try and convince them otherwise.  But when hatred leads to a massive amount of mental anguish about oneself, then they need to be removed.  Trying to help someone is all well and nice when <i>you</i> can handle it and <i>you</i> aren&#39;t constantly in their line of fire.<br><br>3) Going off <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=228132;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a>, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=228138;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a>, and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=228166;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this.</a><br><br>I honestly don&#39;t see any bit where VM says she actually thought that this is what StarShadow thought.<br><br><i>&quot;The problem I see is that anyone who doesn‚Äôt support gay rights, and all their opinion on said topic, are labeled as homophobic.&quot;</i><br><br>I defy anyone on this planet to come up with a reason as to why not supporting gay rights is not homophobic.<br><br>There are only really two possibilities, with the strict focus on same-sex marriage:<br><br>1: You&#39;re against all marriage.<br><br>Doesn&#39;t make you homophobic because you just don&#39;t believe anyone should be getting married.  You&#39;re as against heterosexual marriage as same-sex marriage.<br><br>2: You&#39;ve never even heard of the concept of gay marriage.<br><br>But once you have, where do you go from there?  If you aren&#39;t okay with it, any excuse you can come up with makes it homophobic.<br><br>VM responded to that with this:<br><br><i>&quot;Yes. It is true that this amendment would result in basically prohibiting people from talking about how they do not believe in the civil rights of LGBTQ people.&quot;</i><br><br>While I have a feeling that few would necessarily disagree, this is a point that did need clarification and was horrendously over-simplified, as VM later admitted and further expanded upon to essentially say &quot;yeah, you can state your opinion, just don&#39;t be a dick about it.&quot;<br><br>Therefore I&#39;d have to say that what you stated about VM was grossly taken out of context and pretty much completely disregarded her entire argument.  VM did not state that StarShadow assumed anything.  She simply pointed out that there is a difference between having an opinion and bashing people over the head with it.<br><br>Now, I am well aware that I am mighty incensed right now, and here&#39;s why: None of these arguments are illegitimate.  The problem is the <i>context</i> in which they were brought up.  They essentially ignore the entire issue with Jacer and what she did, and that I find utterly disgraceful.  We were not mature, we were not reasonable.  We were not vigilantes, we were bystanders.  We didn&#39;t just let someone have an opinion, we let someone smear it in our faces and beat us around the head with it.</p>

            <p>Here, let me try again. <br><br>First, my objection was to a specific wording in the amendment--which is no longer present, which I&#39;m glad to see. I certainly wasn&#39;t trying to say &quot;yay, Jacer is okay and should stay!&quot; What worried me was the blanket ban on &#39;diffusion of harmful opinions,&#39; which I thought was a clause prone to possible abuse.  <br><br>Second, I honestly do believe that a case-by-case basis is still the best way to deal with this. It worries me that we anticipate more of this, to be honest, and I really, really hope this amendment never does have to be cited. But even if I disagree, this is a democracy, and I respect the right of the Board to make it. <br><br>I&#39;ve only made about three posts on this topic, and I&#39;m already exhausted. It worries me that the Board <i>wasn&#39;t</i> mature enough to handle this, at least this time. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t trying to offend anyone, but I couldn&#39;t lie when the original amendment was being discussed: I was concerned. I hope I&#39;ve made myself clear, and if you guys think that I should leave, I will. I hate seeing the PPC squabbling.</p>

            <p>...looking back at it, the initial statement could have been a lot better formulated. It was a crude idea, but I felt that it was important to get something in the air as fast as possible so that we can at least generate a discussion about patching a gaping loophole in our Constitution.<br><br>I wanted to make some sort of blanket statement to cover all the things that I felt could potentially be used to spread hate around the Board. &quot;<i>Diffusion of harmful opinions</i>&quot; was meant to prevent somebody saying something along the lines of:<br><br>&quot;Well, in my opinion, all of the people who like X are [insert really mean things here] because nobody in their right mind would like X. But it&#39;s just my opinion, and the Constitution says I&#39;m entitled to one, so ha-ha.&quot;<br><br>I can now see the problem with the wording that I used: by trying to close a loophole, I&#39;ve opened another one. <br><br>Is this what it feels like to be a lawyer? Good grief.<br><br>Anyhoo, I really should have stepped in and clarified when this was first brought up. Your opinion is indeed pertinent and contributes to a better, more refined final draft of the amendment. I agree with you when you say we need to look at this case-by-case. We need to be able to use common sense to deal with problems like these.<br><br>I am so sorry for all of the trouble that my poor wording and my inaction caused.</p>

            <p>People did defend Jacer. I rather doubt they all-if any- actually agree with Jacer&#39;s opinions, but nevertheless, they did defend her to some extent or another. <br><br>Neshomeh defended Jacer against Tray when Tray said Jacer&#39;s opinions were wrong, in the the same post where he made it clear he didn&#39;t feel safe with Jacer around. She followed the rules to a tee, and directly cited them, and said that we cannot say that someone&#39;s opinion is wrong- even when the person she was saying this to was made to feel unsafe and unwanted by this opinion. We are changing the constitution because this course of action isn&#39;t right. <br><br>I have a problem with this because she had said this with regards to the behavior other people were showing: &quot;While we should perhaps be talking to those people at some point, too, they aren&#39;t the ones asking for Permission in this thread, so their behavior doesn&#39;t bear on the discussion at all. Bringing them up is, consciously or not, just an attempt to distract us from the actual topic of discussion, which is Jacer&#39;s behavior.&quot; <br><br>Condemning people&#39;s behavior when they are the victim- especially in public- only encourages bullies. Bullies don&#39;t care about the rules, and when they see that the rules prevent their victims from fighting back, it&#39;s that much better for them. <br><br>I spoke to Neshomeh in private after she posted that. Her opinion and her reasoning of her actions remained the same. I do not know if they&#39;ve changed since then, but she has not publicly apologized for her part in Tray&#39;s decision to leave, or has acknowledged her part in this. <br><br><br>AnnaBee attempted to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=227813;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">defend Jacer </a> with apologism, excuses, and the truth of FREE SPEECH to say anything and everything. <br><br><br>He may also be alluding to Tungsten_Monk, whose post in the initial amendment thread can be taken as also defending the right of people to post whatever they like, even if it results in people leaving due to abuse.  <br><br><br>You also had initially defended Jacer early on when you didn&#39;t have the full story, but when you realized it was a recurring and severe problem and that you didn&#39;t have the full facts before, you promptly withdrew that support and apologized. <br><br>(As a note to other PPCers reading this, as you can see here by the use of bold and the misspelling of &#39;guarantee&#39;, this means that hS is rather irked. Please treat your Huinesoron with care, dignity, and respect, and those that it has deemed fellow community members and living beings with similar respect to prevent such a malfunction or worse from occurring in the future.)</p>

            <p>Let me start off by saying that I did, in fact, express my regrets about what happened in that thread, in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=227883;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">this post</a>. I&#39;m not at all happy about any of it, particularly not that I inadvertently sparked it. If the issue here is that I failed to use the exact words &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; then, well, I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ll put this up front: I do not support Jacer&#39;s behavior and I do not think she should have been allowed to stay. I never have. The reason I didn&#39;t make this post before now is because, when I asked whether or not defending myself would be construed as defending Jacer, I got a roundly discouraging single response. I do appreciate that Maslab bothered to say something, but I would have appreciated it even more if you (July), or Artell, or anybody else in that first round of finger-wagging in my direction had shown me the courtesy of a response to that question. As it was, I&#39;ve felt for the past couple of weeks that anything I said would only further damn me. And so I was silent.<br><br>Thanks to hS, I have a little hope that I haven&#39;t been completely written off yet, so here goes.<br><br>Going forward, if I&#39;m understanding you right, your three main accusations are these:<br><br>1. That I advocated for the letter of the rules at the expense of the spirit of the rules.<br><br>2. That I committed the logical fallacy I described in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=227817;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">this post</a>.<br><br>3. That I publicly corrected a victim of abuse.<br><br>To begin with the first, I think I need to explain exactly what I thought the rule meant. The portion of the rule I cited is a very small part of the first rule in the Constitution, which reads:<br><blockquote>&quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. So be nice! Treat everyone else in the PPC with respect! Respect them personally, and respect their opinions, especially when it comes to controversial issues. You don‚Äôt have to agree with anyone, of course, and stating your own opinion is encouraged, but no telling other people that their opinion is WRONG. It‚Äôs kind of hard for an opinion to be wrong, considering that it‚Äôs how that certain individual sees a certain issue. Their opinions are just as valid as yours ‚Äî and yes, your opinions are wanted, too, however new you are.&quot;</blockquote>I took the portion I cited more or less literally: where an opinion is a subjective thought or belief, based on life experience, that cannot be proven or disproven; and where wrongness is the state of being factually and/or morally incorrect; that telling someone their opinion is <i>wrong</i> is not allowed.<br><br>Now, I do personally believe certain beliefs/opinions are morally wrong or morally right, but those are just <i>my</i> beliefs, informed by my own unique, personal, subjective life experience. However strongly right I feel about them, someone else feels just as strongly right about theirs, even if their beliefs are in direct opposition to mine. I don&#39;t want anyone going around condemning my beliefs (and thus the life experience informing them) as wrong, because that&#39;s offensive to me. I do not wish to be offensive myself, so I don&#39;t condone doing the same thing to other people. Even if I don&#39;t like them.<br><br>So, that is the spirit which I believed to be represented by the first rule of the Constitution: we are not the ultimate authority on the truth, therefore we don&#39;t get to judge whose opinions are right and whose are wrong; only whether or not we personally agree with them. &quot;Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself,&quot; basically. I also believed that it applied to everyone equally, not just people we don&#39;t like.<br><br>I do see how this can be construed as defending Jacer, in the sense that it advocates for civil speech in her direction. However, I think the crucial difference in perspective we&#39;re having here is that I didn&#39;t speak up for her sake. I spoke up because I didn&#39;t want to see Tray, or Lielac, or anyone else, stoop to her level, where condemnation and insults are acceptable. I&#39;m hard-pressed to understand why I should be ashamed of myself for that.<br><br><br>Second, the fallacy. It&#39;s quite clear to me that I didn&#39;t describe it well enough, so I&#39;d like to set that straight.<br><br>The fallacy I referred to there was one of introducing irrelevant material into an argument, where I understood the question to be &quot;Should Jacer be given Permission on the grounds of her past behavior?&quot; Other people&#39;s behavior has no bearing on the question of whether Jacer&#39;s behavior merits Permission; it is irrelevant, therefore her introduction of it in her arguments was fallacious.<br><br>I did not commit that fallacy. When I addressed Tray (and also Lielac; why does no one mention that I scolded Lielac?), I was engaging with an entirely different question: &quot;Is this person&#39;s behavior acceptable?&quot; I have been under the impression that calling people names, telling them their opinion is bad and they should feel bad, or otherwise being disrespectful is not acceptable for anyone at any time, so I acted accordingly. I believed this had no bearing on the above fallacy, because it was a different conversation. In my posts to Tray and Lielac, I never once asserted or, so far as I can tell, even implied that Jacer should get Permission, or that her behavior is acceptable to me, because of theirs. Disliking Person A&#39;s behavior does not mean I must approve of Person B, even if Person A&#39;s behavior is directed at Person B. Disliking Person A&#39;s behavior simply means I dislike Person A&#39;s behavior.<br><br>I am sorry I didn&#39;t make myself clear enough, and that it led to such an awful misunderstanding, but I simply did not commit the fallacy you&#39;ve accused me of committing. I can&#39;t apologize for something I didn&#39;t do.<br><br><br>Third, I did in fact publicly correct Tray, and he is in fact a victim of abuse. I think we&#39;re having another crucial difference of perspective over whether or not correcting abuse victims is wrong.<br><br>You&#39;ve said here that you have a problem with this because it encourages bullies. I don&#39;t agree: I think that letting respected members of the community get away with ignoring the rules (which I thought Tray had stated his intention to do) shows others that the rules are useless, and can be negotiated if the right conditions, such as being a victim, are met. Can anyone break any rule and not be corrected for it if they&#39;ve been hurt in the past? That doesn&#39;t sound fair to me. It also leaves a window open for unscrupulous people to claim that they&#39;ve been victims, and that therefore they should be allowed to break the rules, too. I don&#39;t like that idea. Furthermore, if bullies don&#39;t care about the rules, then they&#39;re going to be bullies whether we enforce the rules or not. I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s grounds for not enforcing the rules.<br><br>Again, it seems my understanding of the rule in question has been vastly different from everyone else&#39;s, and I think it&#39;s that difference of understanding that led to all the trouble. I can only apologize again for being unclear, and promise to strive for better going forward.<br><br><br>In addition, I&#39;ve mentioned repeatedly that I scolded Lielac for basically the same thing at the same time as Tray. I keep pointing it out because no one has told me I was out of line for that, and it confuses me. If it was wrong to correct Tray right there and then, why is no one telling me it was wrong to correct Lielac right there and then? The only difference I can see is that Lielac hasn&#39;t said if she&#39;s been a victim at any time, and also she didn&#39;t declare that she was leaving afterward‚Äîshe actually apologized for descending to personal insults. Does this mean that no one is concerned about my post to her <i>because</i> she&#39;s not (to our knowledge) a victim and hasn&#39;t said she&#39;s leaving? Does anyone think that&#39;s fair to her? I don&#39;t.<br><br><br>So, to sum up: I am sorry my posts weren&#39;t clear enough, and that they led to such a huge explosion of drama, and I am sorry Tray left. I am not sorry I spoke up for the Golden Rule, and for being civil even to widely disliked individuals, and for everyone following whatever rules the community agrees are appropriate (and we did agree on Rule 1 at some point). Those are important principles of mine, and I thought they were PPC principles, too. I can&#39;t apologize for believing in them or for acting on them, even if everything went badly afterwards, and I hope no one seriously expects me to do so.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>People seem to be hitting their breaking points, and this is probably in large part because of the fact that we have all, for a very long time now, cared about and trusted each other.

I don&#39;t have a solid place to stand and make a point here, and every time I have tried, the ground has shifted beneath my feet. All I, or just about anyone, accomplished in that damned Permission thread was hurting people we cared about. I don&#39;t know how to move on from that. I still believe the things I said in the post farther down, and I still believe the things I said in the IRC when that entire bomb went off, too. But I don&#39;t know where to draw the lines; it was pointed out privately, after things spiraled out of control, that the best approach would be to discuss the academics of Constitution vs. defending against bullies vs. Civility vs. Sensitivity, and so on, after the problem at hand, the part that was hurting people, the thing we all agreed on, (Jacer) had been taken care of. This thread, I thought, would be that debate, talking about the points we do disagree about.<br><br>But things are still murky; we&#39;re all still hurting, and still lashing out. I&#39;m finding it hard to speak up at all, after what happened in the IRC during that thread. I don&#39;t have the answers, I have reached the end of my understanding. There&#39;s no righteous anger or academic fine points or high-handed morals to be had here. All I have left on this subject is sorrow. I keep trying to reach for Serious Important Points, and my brain just goes &quot;This is stupid, and it hurts.&quot; And I wish we could all just close it and lock the door and walk away, but that&#39;s not really an option.<br><br>For what it&#39;s worth, I understand what Neshomeh is saying, here. I don&#39;t know if I agree or not; the same thing happened in the IRC. I spoke up for what I saw as civil behavior, against a perceived double standard, and people took it as me defending Jacer, and responded as such. Neshomeh stepped up, trying to calm things down, and got piled on - in summary, as if she was telling everyone to leave Jacer alone, because there Ain&#39;t No Rule against bigots and bullies in the PPC. Which, to be as clear as I can, she was not.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I would still say the same things, if I could go back. I still think it is important, and will always be important, that when we tell someone they don&#39;t belong here, that our arguments for doing so be solid, valid, and worded with what civility we can muster. I don&#39;t know if what I said, or what Neshomeh said, was in the wrong. I can&#39;t help feeling like the entire thread got twisted and manipulated, somehow, since absolutely nobody, when all the facts had surfaced, believed that Jacer should be allowed to remain in the PPC. It should have been so simple. &quot;She has done this, that, this, and done this to someone, and had this effect, and we don&#39;t want her here.&quot;<br><br>But maybe part of the reason that didn&#39;t happen was the nature of the thread. When DoctorHello did his thing, it was an introduction thread. Clear, obvious signals, flashing red, going &quot;This person should not be allowed here.&quot; Again, with Jacer, we all pretty much agreed that she should not be around anymore. But at what point was that the case? <i>Why didn&#39;t this surface until her permission thread?</i> I guess that&#39;s what this is here to fix, and why it&#39;s so important that we iron these out. It just seems like things keep getting complicated. Everyone agrees we need this to happen, but every argument that comes up for or against every single specific point triggers another series of things regarding the incident that brought it on. Every time a disagreement, no matter what nature, is brought up, a wound is opened.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how to fix this thing, and I don&#39;t know how to breach the gap that seems to have sprung up between us all. And that seems like a terrible way to end a post, which is hard to do, since Huinesoron and JulyFlame seem to be trying so hard to end their posts by making sure everything is still not entirely dark and terrible.<br><br>But <i>I don&#39;t know</i>. Maybe the only way forward is to try to forgive each other, to realize that we&#39;re all on the same side, here. To work through this with the clear and definite knowledge that no one involved wants to lose another friend over this.</p>

            <p>Friends disagree, sometimes vehemently, often through misunderstanding.

We are the ones put in to <i>fix</i> the blessed thing - even though we&#39;re often the ones who break it.

            <p>You asked if you could defend yourself. Artell said you didn&#39;t need his permission. Artell even said that he knew that your post wasn&#39;t intended to incite the response it did. When you asked if you would be seen as defending Jacer if you said anything for yourself, Maslab said that defending yourself wouldn&#39;t be seen as defending Jacer. The only &#39;discouraging&#39; part in either reply was Maslab saying he was disappointed in you, which considering the circumstances is wholly understandable, and something I also thought as well. So no, it wasn&#39;t a single discouraging reply. I felt no need to reply, since it would only be repeating Artell and Maslab. <br><br>With regards to publically correcting Tray, I said it twice to you, in my post in response and also in private:<br><br>&quot;If at any point he should be talked to about his behavior, it is not anytime right now with relation to this thread in public.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tell Tray off in private. Tell him you&#39;ll be wanting to talk to him later, when he&#39;s calmed down. Not after he&#39;s said he&#39;s tried to commit suicide because of someone and has admitted to a having had a dark terrible thing happen to him and has made it clear he doesn&#39;t feel safe.&quot;<br><br>Nowhere did I say we should let him off the hook without any problem, nor did imply we should let people break the rules without consideration so long as they were victims or claim to be victims. Please do not suggest I was advocating such in the future. <br><br>Focusing on the behavior of others was not appropriate at that time. Again, to quote my post in response to you: &#39;Talking to someone about their behavior at some point does not mean chastising about it in public, and certainly not after they&#39;ve exposed themselves and have made it clear they do not feel safe.&#39; Lielac and Tray&#39;s behavior was not important. I was not speaking in terms that solely applied to Tray there. The issue at hand was Jacer&#39;s behavior. </p>

            <p>The reason I&#39;m not counting Artell&#39;s response to my first question is that my first question didn&#39;t correctly convey my meaning. I know, and knew then, that I don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s permission to speak. What I actually wanted to know, as I explained in my second question, was whether it would be worth the effort. With all due respect to Maslab, he&#39;s just one person, and he wasn&#39;t one of the people who led the charge, so to speak. I wasn&#39;t willing to open myself to further accusations and censure from you, Artell, Cassie, Rilwen, HerrWozzeck, etc., on the assumption that Maslab was speaking for anyone but Maslab. The fact that you didn&#39;t feel the need to assure me I wasn&#39;t beyond redemption in your eyes is pretty discouraging, and that goes for everyone who spoke up after you, too.<br><br>I don&#39;t understand your insistence that communicating to Tray privately would have been better for Tray. (At least, I think that&#39;s what you mean.) It might have prevented the subsequent drama, at least the parts that happened on the Board, but in hindsight I don&#39;t think he would have taken it any better at the time.<br><br>As for waiting to say something until later, public or private, I would like to know when you think would have been an appropriate time. How long is long enough to wait without letting the incident in question fade too much from relevance? How can I know when the time is right, and that I won&#39;t just be rebuked for not letting old threads lie?<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve stated that part of my reason for posting was that I didn&#39;t want to see non-Jacer people reduced to insults, condemnation, and other behaviors we claim not to want on the Board. Can you please tell me how you think I could have gotten across the message of &quot;hey guys, let&#39;s not turn this thread into a flamefest&quot; by waiting until later to say something, or by speaking to one or two people in private?<br><br>Finally, has anything I&#39;ve said made any kind of positive impact at all? I can&#39;t read your mind, so please tell me. If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; I can go find something else to do that won&#39;t make me frustrated, sad, and angry for no purpose.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(Please note: this was written immediately before I saw your post, but I don&#39;t think you have invalidated anything I said. Urrr, actually I may need an endnote...)<br><br>This is how I see the above few posts:<br><br>Neshomeh has stated that she never supported or condoned Jacer&#39;s views, and has apologised for anything she said which might have given the impression that she did (&quot;I am sorry my posts weren&#39;t clear enough&quot;). She has also said she is sorry for her part in exploding the thread and causing people to leave.<br><br>She has not apologised for (and, in fact, her entire post is an explanation of) her rebuking of people, including Tray, who were acting contrary to how she believed a PPCer should act. I don&#39;t get the impression this comes down to blind adherence to the Rules, but rather to (as she terms it) the Golden Rule: politeness and civility. To put it another way, I feel that even without a Constitution she would have made that decision.<br><br>I also feel that the way Neshomeh was replied to while asking if she was allowed to defend herself gave the distinct impression that she would, indeed, be seen as defending Jacer by speaking up for herself. I know I felt that way, and the comments in question weren&#39;t even aimed at me. <b>I am not saying or implying</b> that anyone actually <i>meant</i> she couldn&#39;t defend herself without being condemned - I am just pointing out that, given the state of our emotions at that time, the reading is not implausible.<br><br>July has indicated that her objection was less about whether Tray-and-others should be rebuked at all, and more about whether they should be rebuked in that particular thread. She states that &#39;The issue at hand was Jacer&#39;s behavior&#39;, indicating that other people&#39;s behaviour in response to the discussion of Jacer&#39;s behaviour should not have been commented on at that time, and also indicates (correct me, please, if I&#39;m wrong) that publically rebuking someone who is in a fragile emotional state is Not A Good Idea. She does not deny that the behaviour of certain people required a response at some point - just that the response needed to be in that setting.<br><br>(A Huinesoron aside: I don&#39;t believe <i>in general terms</i> that people should go unrebuked in a public setting where they have broken the Golden Rule. If Jacer had been called out instead for egregious swearing, I think that someone who set to insulting Jacer would have been quite appropriately rebuked. However, in specific cases of emotional vulnerability... see next paragraph. July, this aside is mostly for you, since it&#39;s the one point where I&#39;m unclear on your views: in a less volatile situation, such as the swearing one, would Neshomeh&#39;s actions have been appropriate in your view?)<br><br><u><b>The Key Section</b></u><br><br>With all these words flying around, it seems to me that these two respected Boarders - yes, I&#39;m talking to you two, and even I respect you both - actually disagree on very little. Essentially it comes down to: should a person who has noted that they are in a fragile emotional state be publically and immediately rebuked for using emotional language, in a setting where this may cause them to break?<br><br>I think that July would say that they should not be. I would like to know what Neshomeh thinks - what she thinks is the answer to my question, and what, in hindsight (which is 20/20) she feels she could have done to stop &#39;this thread [turning] into a flamefest&#39; that wasn&#39;t what she did.<br><br>Neshomeh - I want you to know that the PPC Board is still a safe place. I don&#39;t think anyone will start attacking you if you post what you think about this specific question. I am positive that no one will see an admission of making a mistake - if you feel you made any mistakes, I am <b>not</b> making that judgement call - as a sign of weakness.<br><br>I can say this, because I have now apologised three times, and have not been mocked for it in any of them. I made a major mistake in assuming all the information had been made available to me, and a second (judging from the response, far larger) by posting without due thought for how it would be perceived in response to I think your post. I apologise (yet again) for both of those mistakes. I don&#39;t think anyone sees this as a confession that I was supporting Jacer&#39;s actions - just that I am <s>human</s> Eldarin, and mistakes happen.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: This was supposed to be a short post...)<br><br>(PPS: Neshomeh: please don&#39;t leave)</p>

            <p>Mainly, the answer to your question:<br><br>In the <i>most general of terms</i>, I do not believe being in an emotional state while posting is a free pass to not being immediately accountable for what you say. In particular, we routinely dismiss emotional states like anger and excitement as excuses for acting out without thinking, and we routinely tell people to take a deep breath and wait to post until they&#39;re in control of themselves when emotion-inducing topics come up. If they don&#39;t, they are still responsible for making the choice to post in that state. I don&#39;t think I would <i>generally</i> make an exception for fear, panic, or ... is there a word for triggered-ness? The reason is that this is the Internet, and unlike &quot;real life,&quot; there is always the option <i>not</i> to hit Enter until you&#39;ve taken a moment to breathe and check that your emotions aren&#39;t getting in the way of making your point.<br><br><i>However,</i> having slept on it and thinking over it all again, it looks like that is exactly what turned around to bite me. I didn&#39;t take Tray&#39;s specific emotional state as seriously as it looks like everyone else did, and that was clearly in error, and I am sorry for it. When I posted, I hoped that he would be able to take a step back and cool down, and then still participate in the discussion. In hindsight, I guess that was stupid of me.<br><br>I think I can explain a little bit why I made that mistake, though, and how I can watch that it doesn&#39;t happen again.<br><br>The thing is, I&#39;m really, really skeptical about triggers. I understand what they are: an uncontrolled, irrational, emotional and/or physiological response to some stimulus, associated with past emotional trauma. Phobos pointed out to me that I even used to have a mild one regarding alcohol: my dad&#39;s a recovered alcoholic, so I used to get extremely upset just seeing someone I care about, such as my boyfriend, drinking. The first time I saw my boyfriend before Phobos having a drink and a cigar at a family gathering, I broke down crying without even realizing I was doing it until I felt something crawling on my cheek, thought it was a bug, and discovered tears instead. Surprise crying, not making this up. I took off by myself for awhile to let it out, and once I&#39;d calmed down a bit and decided that my boyfriend is not my dad, there&#39;s no reason to assume the same bad things will happen, and I don&#39;t get to tell other grown-up people what legal substances they can and can&#39;t have when it&#39;s in an entirely appropriate setting, then I came back, and we talked about it, and we got on with having a good time. (I still don&#39;t drink, but I now vicariously participate in alcohol-culture through Phobos, who is a very responsible drinker, and we cook with wine sometimes.)<br><br>Anyway, the point of the story is that I get what a trigger is, and I get that they&#39;re real. I am skeptical of them when they start getting waved around like magic amulets that give the wielder the right to do whatever they want and to tell other people what they can and can&#39;t do or say in the wielder&#39;s presence. <i><b>I&#39;m not saying Tray did this</b></i>, but it does happen. This is problematic to me both because it&#39;s manipulative, and because it&#39;s bad for the triggered person: using a trigger as an excuse suggests to me that they&#39;re not working on dealing with it so they can get on with a more-normal, less-subject-to-uncontrolled-bad-feelings kind of life.<br><br>So, when the word &quot;trigger&quot; started popping up in that thread, my skepticism kicked in, and that was a factor in my decision whether to post, and how. Listening to it as much as I did was a mistake, and again, I&#39;m sorry. I should have realized Tray was in no position to react differently than he did, trigger or no trigger. In the future, I can be more aware of my feelings about triggers and make sure they don&#39;t unduly influence my judgement about how seriously to take someone&#39;s emotional state.<br><br>I think I had trouble realizing and addressing that mistake because I was so preoccupied with accusations of things I <i>don&#39;t</i> think I did‚Äî&quot;defending Jacer,&quot; committing fallacies, posting in the wrong time and place, ignoring the spirit of the rules‚Äîand also because I very definitely didn&#39;t feel like many people were going to be sympathetic to anything I had to say anyway. It&#39;s only thanks to hS being so understanding and encouraging that I&#39;ve been able to reach this point, so thank you, hS.<br><br>Er, there was another part to your question, too, wasn&#39;t there? In hindsight, what could I have done differently to stop the thread descending into bonfire territory without making the same mistake?<br><br>One thing I could&#39;ve done is make a general reply to the original post, rather than any individuals in the thread‚Äîa general &quot;hey everyone, let&#39;s watch out that we don&#39;t start flaming, because we&#39;re better than that.&quot; This might have gotten the message across without making anyone feel like I was cornering them. The risk with this is that the people already flaming might not look at it, or might not think they are flaming and so might decide it doesn&#39;t apply to them. Also, I&#39;m not confident about this because it still violates the thing about not posting in that thread right then at all, and I&#39;m positive it still would have been seen as &quot;defending Jacer.&quot;<br><br>I also could have used milder, less direct language, but it still would&#39;ve been a post in that thread right then, to stop a trend I saw starting at the time.<br><br>I could have started an all-new thread, but that would be pretty unusual, to start a new thread to talk about something currently happening in another one. Under most circumstances, I don&#39;t think that would be acceptable, and it still would have been posting right then, if not right there.<br><br>I would still like to hear if July, and/or anyone else, has other specific ideas with regards to deterring flames, if she/they agree that doing so is a good thing to do. If not here, then where? If not now, then when?<br><br><br>To add: I don&#39;t want to leave. However, the feeling that maybe I should do so for my own well-being doesn&#39;t just come from this one incident; it&#39;s the last couple of years of feeling like I&#39;m sitting on a powder keg, never knowing when it&#39;s going to blow up again or why. The fact that I got caught in the blast this time certainly doesn&#39;t help, but really, like VM says, I&#39;m tired of it in general. I mention it only because I don&#39;t want anyone to be surprised if it does come to the point of me leaving. I don&#39;t want to‚Äîthe Board has been a huge part of my life, and setting it aside would leave a hole I couldn&#39;t easily fill again‚Äîbut I&#39;m damn near the limit of how much stress I&#39;m willing to take for my pastime. I haven&#39;t made this clear enough: my main reason for sticking around and dealing with all the explosions has been the sense that I&#39;m trusted, useful, and valuable to this community. This incident made me feel like that was no longer the case, and that I had no certain way back into the good graces of the people who are upset with me. My confidence is shattered, and with it my will to put up with much more negativity and stress.<br><br>And I&#39;m still waiting for some word that any of this is doing any good toward fixing things in their eyes‚Äîand I do mean with words explicitly to that effect, because I don&#39;t feel I can trust in anything less right now. I&#39;ve explained myself, I&#39;ve said what I think I did wrong, and I&#39;ve said I&#39;m sorry. If I&#39;m forgiven, or if I&#39;m not yet but still can be in the future, then I need to be told so if I&#39;m going to build up my confidence again. I just want everyone to understand that I won&#39;t wait much longer. Especially since I&#39;m <i>also</i> going on vacation soon, starting August 12, and it&#39;s going to be a busy month.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I mean sure, everyone has triggers in that we have something embarrassing or nasty that happened to us that sometimes comes back to us from a certain sensation, word or whatever, but that&#39;s completely different from what happens with people with deep-seated, nigh existential trauma. <br><br>As far as &quot;dealing with it&quot;, I think people should be allowed to work with their issues at their own pace, and we don&#39;t have a leg to stand on telling them when is the right time to &quot;get over it&quot;. <br><br>Again, the PPC doesn&#39;t have to be an accommodating place, but that is always what I thought the PPC should be. We can always turn the dial back on that if as a community we wish to, but it will drive people - lovely, wonderful people - away.<br><br><br><br>&quot;So, when the word &quot;trigger&quot; started popping up in that thread, my skepticism kicked in, and that was a factor in my decision whether to post, and how. Listening to it as much as I did was a mistake, and again, I&#39;m sorry. I should have realized Tray was in no position to react differently than he did, trigger or no trigger. In the future, I can be more aware of my feelings about triggers and make sure they don&#39;t unduly influence my judgement about how seriously to take someone&#39;s emotional state.&quot;<br><br><br>I appreciate this, even if I&#39;m not in a position to provide forgiveness. I&#39;m just concerned that with the rest of your post, I get the impression that you are still not entirely convinced that triggers are a Thing, and I am hoping I am misreading this when it looks like &quot;I&#39;m sorry you got offended&quot; to me.<br><br>Far be it from me to stir this you-know-what-storm any further, and that is not my intent here; I&#39;ve tried to stay away from the Board because I find dealing with this kind of thing emotionally draining. But I am worried that the basic issue here remains unresolved, and some of the responses to your post almost feel like a relieved overreaction that you are not gone forever. (I, by the way, am happy you are not gone forever, too.) <br><br><br><br>&quot;I think I had trouble realizing and addressing that mistake because I was so preoccupied with accusations of things I don&#39;t think I did‚Äî&quot;defending Jacer,&quot; committing fallacies, posting in the wrong time and place, ignoring the spirit of the rules‚Äîand also because I very definitely didn&#39;t feel like many people were going to be sympathetic to anything I had to say anyway. It&#39;s only thanks to hS being so understanding and encouraging that I&#39;ve been able to reach this point, so thank you, hS.&quot;<br><br>Again, here I am going to have disagree with the utmost respect. I&#39;ve already made my point. Maybe it&#39;s not a good idea to start that argument anew, but I am not going to have it be thought that the argument is over and conceded. I would like to say that I don&#39;t think the people who kept muddling the issue and standing up for Jacer were necessarily agreeing with her positions; like I said before, it just felt like people wanting to defend the &quot;bad guy&quot; just for the sake of devil&#39;s advocating, which absolutely has no place in the LGBT discussion. <br>I am proudly, gleefully, eagerly a total absolutist in favour of human rights when it comes to the LGBT discussion, and I will not stand by when such odious positions are thrown about like it&#39;s no big thing. <br><br><br><br>&quot;To add: I don&#39;t want to leave. However, the feeling that maybe I should do so for my own well-being doesn&#39;t just come from this one incident; it&#39;s the last couple of years of feeling like I&#39;m sitting on a powder keg, never knowing when it&#39;s going to blow up again or why. The fact that I got caught in the blast this time certainly doesn&#39;t help, but really, like VM says, I&#39;m tired of it in general.&quot;<br><br>I certainly know what you mean, and I&#39;m experiencing the same, and my exposure to the Board is relatively minimal. <br><br>However, you shouldn&#39;t decide whether you want to leave or not based solely, or even majorly, on what I think.</p>

            <p>All that I can forgive, on my part, I forgive. I apologize since I probably didn&#39;t make that clear enough. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by good faith. But I know and happily say that you are not a bad or an evil person, that you are in fact a good and nice person.

            <p>I think the biggest difference between us at the time was how we understood (the former) Rule 1 in the Constitution. I think I explained my end, but if I didn&#39;t say this, I&#39;ll say now that I never understood it to mean that we shouldn&#39;t stand up for ourselves or that we should tolerate people being bigots. I do think that we should avoid treating even bigots in the same way they treat their targets, though. I think we can tell people we don&#39;t agree with them or want them around without treating them like they&#39;re less than human. Does that make sense?<br><br>When I say I would like to be taken in good faith, I mean that I would like to be able to post what I think without having implications and impressions read in where I have taken pains not to put anything but straightforward explanations. For instance:<br><br>- &quot;It implies something, even if you didn&#39;t mean to.&quot;<br><br>I <i>didn&#39;t</i> mean to. I meant no more or less than to say that people sometimes use triggers as excuses, and for that reason I am skeptical when they&#39;re brought up. To ensure that no one got the wrong idea, because I knew I was in delicate territory, I put a double emphasis on the fact that I am not accusing Tray of this, just explaining why my skepticism exists. I even went on to say that my skepticism was misplaced in this instance, and that it led me astray, and that I&#39;m sorry for it.<br><br>But you&#39;re still concerned that I was accusing Tray of using triggers as an excuse. I don&#39;t understand why, unless you think I&#39;m not telling the truth.<br><br>Also from that section of your post, I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re coming from with the bit about telling people when to get over it. I don&#39;t think I said anything to that effect. I did say that I think triggers should be worked on so they don&#39;t run anyone&#39;s life forever, because having your life run by emotional trauma is sucky, but did you think I was implying a time limit somewhere?<br><br>- &quot;I get the impression that you are still not entirely convinced that triggers are a Thing.&quot;<br><br>I said twice that I am, and told a personal story as evidence. I don&#39;t understand why that&#39;s not enough.<br><br>- &quot;it just felt like people wanting to defend the &quot;bad guy&quot; just for the sake of devil&#39;s advocating&quot;<br><br>A major part of my first post was explaining how I was not playing devil&#39;s advocate, or citing the rules just because I could, or whatever, but rather speaking from my personal beliefs about how all human beings should be treated, which I thought were reflected in the rules. If you disagree with me about how all human beings should be treated, I can understand that, but do you disagree that I mean what I said?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>For whatever it&#39;s worth, I still have tremendous amounts of respect for you. I always read your posts not as a dismissal of Tray and Lielac or as a defense of Jacer, but as you asking people to step back for a second, and take advantage of the medium to not be so hot-headed.<br>Admittedly, I had the advantage of hindsight, because I was gone for a week, and by the time I had a stable internet, that thread had mostly died down and SeaTurtle had already made the precursor to this thread. Still, I&#39;d like to think that I am (as of late, at least) a reasonable enough fellow that I would have at least tried to help things simmer down a little.<br><br>I will miss you, should you choose to go, but I can&#39;t say I&#39;ll blame you. Even before the most recent mess with Jacer, the PPC was, at times, stressful enough that we lost people, even regulars who had been here for several years.</p>

            <p>I do usually try to help diffuse arguments and generally be a reasonable person, as of late at least, but it is not a consistent thing. There are times when I feel that&#39;s it&#39;s not worth it, or that a person is getting what they had coming, or so on. I am prone to being a snarky jerk just because I feel like it, which I recognize means that I am not exactly mature. Or at the very least, not very. <br><br>On the other hand, when something requires me to be serious about it, I can usually pull together and act like a reasonable being. (Which, in retrospect, may be why people put enough trust into me to make me a Designated Arbitrator while I was still hanging out in the IRC.) I will always, or at least most of the time, listen to reason when the person is making sense. I typically respond to people being reasonable by putting forth an effort to be reasonable myself, despite what my current mood may be.<br><br>I guess the tl;dr version would be &quot;I do consider myself to usually be a reasonable person, but while that may be an aspect of maturity, I don&#39;t feel like that alone makes a person mature.&quot;</p>

            <p>Neshomeh, you&#39;ve poured your heart and soul into this community for as long as I can remember. You smooth things over, level things out, keep people and matters reasonable, and you&#39;re always sensible, even when the rest of us are <i>this</i> far from snapping.

I really hope that you don&#39;t leave, but not for the above reasons; I hope you stay, because you are an awesome person, and someone who it&#39;s been a privilege to have around here. Because we care about you, because you would leave this a darker, dimmer place.<br><br>That&#39;s not really enough, though; it isn&#39;t fair to ask you to stay for the sake of the rest of us. I hope you stay, because we can work this out, because we can be a community of friends again, because we can not only defuse this bomb, but cart the explosives off in loads and set things back to rights, and maybe take the load off of your shoulders, and maybe make this fun again, a joy instead of a burden.<br><br>-VM</p>

            <p>&quot;Beyond just that, you&#39;ve gone through emotional hell these last few weeks. You&#39;ve been attacked by the community, you&#39;ve done some hugely deep introspection, you&#39;ve bared your heart to the community... and gotten nothing back. That&#39;s a hell of a lot of pain for having a different opinion than some people.&quot;<br><br>Attacked by the community? Does this include my original response to her, pointing out how wrong I felt the constitution was on the matter, etc.? Do you feel that what I did was an attack on Neshomeh? In that case, I should probably leave the PPC, because attacks and attackers don&#39;t belong here - I&#39;ve said as much myself, and I wouldn&#39;t want to be a hypocrite. <br><br>I do not have any remorse or regret for my criticism of what was going on in that thread, but the implication seems to be that I should.</p>

            <p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, the only person that is in my bad graves in all of this is Jacer.  The only thing I really see bad going on with anyone is simply a mistake in downplaying what happened.  Not flaming is important, and no, trauma and triggers are not free passes to say what you want.  That said, the initial responses didn&#39;t help Tray, I would think.  A cornered and desperate human is as reasonable and vicious as any cornered and desperate animal.<br><br>As far as a response to that goes, I tend to turn to my three basic rules in life:<br><br>1) Do what you want.<br>2) Don&#39;t be a dick to anyone.<br>3) Disregard rule 2 if the other person does first.<br><br>Jacer disregarded rule 2.  As far as I&#39;m concerned Tray just responded to that.  It could be argued he did late, but then it takes a lot of guts for someone to stand up to a bully.<br><br>And just to make sure that we are all absolutely on the same page: I only blame Jacer for this, and I do not think that any person here actually meant to defend her or however you want me to say it.  I am disappointed in us as a community for how this was handled, but the only person that actually hurt another person in this entire thing is Jacer.  My respect for you may have taken a hit, sure, but I still value you as a prominent member of this community.  If you do want to leave, I won&#39;t stop you as I won&#39;t stop anyone, but know that I don&#39;t want you to because of this, and I feel you should stick around.</p>

            <p>Our basic philosophies are different in that mine doesn&#39;t include your third rule, but I understand it.<br><br>And yeah, I didn&#39;t fully appreciate that Tray was feeling cornered right then. I didn&#39;t mean to give him the idea that he shouldn&#39;t stand up for himself. I let my skepticism get the better of me and didn&#39;t make that clear, and I will strive not to let anything like that happen again.<br><br>I think making Jacer responsible for every last bit of this ascribes her more power than I&#39;d personally like to give her credit for, but I appreciate that you&#39;re willing to move on for any reason, so thank you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s all been one massive, awful mix-up. But just because things have exploded and you happened to wind up in the centre of it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not forgiven.

            <p>A clarification of opinion:<br>I do not consider &#39;defending Jacer&#39; to be synonymous with &#39;stating that a one-time offender should be given another chance&#39;, nor with &#39;stating that people&#39;s reactions can be more severe when provoked&#39;, which is what I attempted to do.<br><br>Some apologies:<br>Once again I apologise for speaking without having full information (or rather without knowing there was any more information to have). I also apologise for my unwise use of the word &#39;defence&#39; (yes, I did say it, and I&#39;m sorry). My original subtitles were &#39;Pros&#39; and &#39;Cons&#39;, but I substituted them at the last moment. I believe my three points (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=227770;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">this</a> is the post I&#39;m referring to, if you can stand to visit that thread again) cannot be interpreted as defence save by reference to the title, but nevertheless, I apologise unreservedly for my misuse of the word.<br><br>A promise:<br>I do not have email access tonight (I&#39;m at work, and the internet is gradually being blocked), but, unless Neshomeh, AnnaBee and Tungsten<em>Monk post in response to you, I will contact them in the morning. I hope that they will respond without my needing to do so.

There is no way for us to know what has been percieved as wrong unless we are told - and that thread was a masterpiece of no-one explaining anything.

            <p>To make this clear:<br><br>I have never had any intention of hounding you at all, so if I&#39;ve been part of the source of that, I apologize immensely and would like to know how I was part of it. <br><br>Believe me, hS, when I say that for a lot of us- or at least me- the PPC wouldn&#39;t even be a <i>fraction</i> of what it is in worth in terms of community and friends if you weren&#39;t here. A lot of us care about you very much. You&#39;re our friend. A very, very good one, in all meanings of it. <br><br>Even when I disagree with you on some points with regards to maintaining the community, or what to do about things when there is a perceived problem, never have I felt that you&#39;ve ever said or done anything out of malice or dislike, or for an attempt at a power grab or to prevent things from improving. Frustrated with you at times with regards to some things, yes, but never like you&#39;re on the side of evil or bad, or that I can&#39;t trust you. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t be here- on the board, in the chat, maybe not even alive- right now if I thought I couldn&#39;t trust you.<br><br>And if the PPC really is your only social place, maybe you should consider looking around for other people to meet up with. There&#39;s probably other new parents nearby where you&#39;re living. That wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea, to see about arranging social time for both you and the Small Child. <br><br>One can&#39;t live off a single thing alone- weirdly enough, this also includes the PPC. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m naturally reluctant to go over the records to check, but I do not feel that you in particular have been hounding me. You have engaged in debate with me over this amendment, but that&#39;s fine - that&#39;s what debate is for.

            <p>As I stated in my above post: I am aware that you&#39;re not trying to defend Jacer, and these would be legitimate concerns given proper context.  However, within the context that this subject is being brought up, I see these criticisms being made as not really paying attention to why we&#39;re making amendments to the rules in the first place.<br><br>That said, we actually have had a zero-tolerance single-offense-excommunication response in a few cases.  Remember DoctorHello, that one guy who thought mutilation and torture was funny?  I recall pretty much everyone jumping to get him out of here.  The only thing that surprises me in this entire situation is that we let Jacer hang around as long as she did, especially considering the damage she did was even more extreme, to my knowledge.  I&#39;m not necessarily against such a policy when it&#39;s meted out only when necessary, such as in a clear case like DoctorHello.  Again, as VM said, there is a line between &quot;I don&#39;t believe this so I can&#39;t condone it&quot; and &quot;you are a terrible, horrible sub-human <i>thing.</i>&quot;<br><br>I apologize if it seems like I&#39;m attacking you.  I&#39;m simply trying to point out why I feel that these criticisms are unnecessary given the background.</p>

            <p>. . . it does apply to everything going forward.  If this were a totally isolated and unique situation, we wouldn&#39;t need to change the Constitution to deal with it -- or rather, we could just add in a &quot;No Jacer&quot; subclause somewhere.  But since we don&#39;t expect it to be the only time we deal with something like this, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to discuss potential future ramifications of proposed changes.<br><br>Personally, I didn&#39;t even know who Jacer was until the Permission thread blew up, so I can&#39;t comment on why there was no huge response until then.  I agree that her comments were absolutely egregious and unacceptable in civilised company (and truly, if the PPC is not civilisation, what is?).  But the single-offence thing was being proposed as a blanket policy to apply to everyone, not just to equally egregious cases.<br><br>And I&#39;ve been a quiet observer of SJW vigilante culture for a few years now, so I know that it does happen, and I know it&#39;s not pretty when it does.  I agree with July etc that it&#39;s very unlikely to come to the PPC, but I also feel that the original proposal would have given it an easy way in.  So in the context of a discussion about whether we should make an amendment, I thought it was appropriate to make a comment about what the amendment might say.  Perhaps that was a little bit radical, but I&#39;ve always liked to live on the wild side.<br><br>I think the current amendment is absolutely fine, for the record.<br><br>-- Kaitlyn</p>

One is deserving of an immediate smackdown, and the other isn&#39;t.  While what one may define as hate speech could potentially be up for some debate, I think that a vast majority of the time it&#39;s pretty obvious.</p>

            <p>No worries about putting this back up top, ma&#39;am. This issue needs to be resolved ASAP.<br><br>I approve of the wording for the amendment but I&#39;d just like to stress one point. One very, <i>very</i> important point. To do this, I&#39;d like to quote what doctorlit said in the first thread:<br><br>&quot;[W]e shouldn&#39;t need a Constitution--any Constitution--to give us basic moral guidelines. [...] So yes, let&#39;s edit the Constitution. But let&#39;s not forget that the Constitution is only a piece of &quot;paper.&quot; We are living, breathing, thinking, feeling human beings. We have minds. We have consciences. Sometimes, we need to use those first and the Constitution second.&quot;</p>

            <p>And I absolutely agree that both &#39;I can do it because the Constitution&#39; and &#39;You can&#39;t do that because the Constitution&#39; can be dangerous and stupid statements. The problem recently seems to have been that people&#39;s consciences seem to have been saying different things - and thus, we codify it a little while assuming that the glorious old PPC spirit of free-range anarchy with big brains will continue to apply its common sense both to what is and is not said.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As I understood it, the fear is that any opinion someone doesn&#39;t agree with which in any way touches on a sensitive topic will be immediately labelled as hateful, regardless of the actual opinion and reasons given.<br><br>And even if I&#39;m wrong - even if, somehow, we have someone on the Board who is saying &#39;I want people to be able to express hateful opinions in an offensive manner&#39; - I still think my interpretation is worth considering.

            <p>I actually think that the amendment - either as stands or with the minor tweaks suggested elsewhere - will cover this just fine. I believe that the PPC Boarders have enough common sense not to explode in someone&#39;s face just because they heard something they didn&#39;t agree with. But it&#39;s not just my Constitution, it&#39;s everyone&#39;s, and I think it important that you (plural) agree with what I&#39;ve just said before you put it in the Constitution.<br><br>I also think it would be a good idea to know -external to the Constitution - exactly where that line lies.

            <p>Specifically views on gay marriage, but they can be extrapolated to other debates.<br><br>1/ Huinesoron&#39;s actual belief: As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that people will be married for eternity for the purpose of having children (it&#39;s complicated). As it stands, Church doctrine is pretty clear that this will require a male and a female - although actually, given that this is God we&#39;re talking about, that may be simply an unwarranted assumption (never thought of that before right now). However, up until 30 seconds ago, I would have said, therefore an eternal gay marriage would be something of a contradiction in terms - it wouldn&#39;t serve its purpose. <i>However</i>, that&#39;s only eternal marriages - sealings, we&#39;d say. What people do in their worldly time is none of my business.<br><br>2/ Hypothetical orthodox liberal Mormon&#39;s belief: She believes that eternal marriage exists for the having of children, and therefore is between a man and a woman. She also believes that every earthly marriage should be working towards becoming an eternal marriage - since she believes (actually so do I) that God&#39;s plan is for everyone to be married who desires to, this means gay marriage would get in the way of that. However, she understands that this is a belief, and shouldn&#39;t affect the laws of the country.<br><br>3/ Hypothetical orthodox conservative Mormon&#39;s belief: He believes much as 2, but also that it is his duty to try and democratically alter the law so that people are encouraged towards (what he believes is) the Right Way.<br><br>4/ Hypothetical orthodox Mormon idiot&#39;s belief: She believes the same as 3, and that it is also her duty to explain to any &#39;gaymosexuals&#39; exactly why they are sinful for wanting to get married - but in the spirit of loving kindness, of course.<br><br>---<br><br>Now, I think it&#39;s pretty clear that 4 is not welcome here - she&#39;s basically going to harangue people and tell them they&#39;re bad people, which is not a good thing. It&#39;s also (I hope!) pretty clear that I&#39;m still okay (since according to the above, I actually apparently believe &#39;Dunno&#39;).<br><br>My personal opinion is that 2 and 3 - provided of course they conduct themselves in a respectful fashion - should be welcome on the Board. They have beliefs, they act on them, but they don&#39;t use them as an excuse for disrespect of persons.<br><br>This is of course only one of their many interlocking beliefs relating to gay marriage, and how welcome they would be of course depends on whether they <i>also</i> believe gay people are whatever whatevers who should be taught the error of their ways for non-marriage-related-reasons (which I do not, in case you&#39;re worried yet), but assuming the opinions above are all they give, in much the same way I&#39;ve presented it... which do people think should be allowed on the Board?<br><br>hS, desperately hoping he hasn&#39;t left out a &#39;not&#39; somewhere that changes everything around...</p>

            <p>I may have over-simplified things, and I&#39;ll try and clarify them here.<br><br>1) Yes, of course the opinions of individuals&#39; are solely their own, to be held and established and changed or not-changed at their own will, and no one else&#39;s.<br><br>2) However, some of those opinions are really unacceptable to be expressed here. For example: &quot;My personal opinion is that people who are attracted to left-handed red-heads is that they are all evil, horrible people who should be forcibly deported because their lusts are an abomination and a detriment to civilization.&quot; This is a bit of hyperbole, to make a specific point: the previous quote is a [hypothetical] opinion, and nobody can stop the [hypothetical] Boarder from having it. But <i>in no wise</i> should that hypothetical Boarder feel that it is okay for them to express it in a PPC space. This is regardless of the reason - if your religion considers all red-haired, left-handed people to be abominations who should be shunned, that&#39;s your business. But it is pretty clearly stated in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">The Constitution</a> that this isn&#39;t an okay thing to say, here. There are, we should assume, left-handed, red-haired Boarders, and the hypothetical Boarder is telling them that they should be exiled or put to death. There is not, and will never, be a good reason for that. It goes rather directly against the first two rules - it is emphatically Not Nice to those Boarders, and it goes pretty hard into flaming territory, considering the message it is sending to any and all left-handed, red-haired Boarders.<br><br>3) As hS has pointed out above, there&#39;s a sort of wavery line there - but I think it&#39;s a bit clearer than it might seem. Contrast the above statement, &quot;I believe red-haired, left-handed people are evil monsters who are detrimental to society and should all be done away with,&quot; with the following: &quot;My religion considers attraction to red-haired, left-handed people sinful, and so I cannot personally condone it.&quot; Do you see the difference? One is respectful statement of religious belief, not targeted at anyone (I cannot speak in support =/= No One Should Ever Consider) and not stated in an &quot;Agree with me or DIE&quot; sort of way. It&#39;s really important to remember that we&#39;re all coming from different places, here. We believe in our own religions&#39; specific sacraments, laws, moral codes, but - this cannot be overstated - we have no power to impose them on anyone else. This applies in law, national or international, and in debates on the interwebs.<br><br>What happened in the previous incident was that someone took their religious beliefs, and applied them rather forcibly (rhetorically speaking, since she had no actual power to do so) to everyone in the conversation, claiming that she was right Because She Just Was, leaving no room for discussion. This alone is employing bad debate tactics, irritating, and likely to get one&#39;s fellow Boarders up in arms. When you combine it with language directly targeted at minorities, including fellow Boarders, things go from Pretty Bad to Nuclear, rather quickly.<br><br>4) Because of the way you phrased the above concern, I did assume that your issue with the new rule was that homophobia was not going to be tolerated. I honestly hope this is not the case - marginalizing and persecuting of specific demographics is not something that is going to be tolerated. The PPC always has been a place where serious open-ended discussion is welcomed, and if people are phrasing their points respectfully and rationally, there should be no issue. As long as we are all keeping this in mind, and respecting each other, I don&#39;t believe this rule should stifle PPC discourse at all.</p>

            <p>Your #3 (wow, it feels good to have a # key again - the computer at work has it assigned to / instead... and / is also assigned /. No #!) is why I&#39;ve been so worried about what a chance consists of. Consider the following exchange:<br><br>---<br><br>AnyBoardy: My religion considers attraction to red-haired, left-handed people sinful, and so I cannot personally condone it.<br><br>Lacksidacksical: Hey, I&#39;m attracted to a red-haired, left-handed person.<br><br>AnyBoardy: Then I personally cannot condone that, but I understand that not everyone feels the same.<br><br>StirrySpoon: Please stop hating on Lacksi. That sort of behaviour is not tolerated here.<br><br>AnyBoardy: Hating? What? I wasn&#39;t hating. I was just saying I personally can&#39;t condone that.<br><br>StirrySpoon: Look at this! I gave himer a chance to recant ant heshe didn&#39;t! I demand that AnyBoardy leave forthwith!<br><br>---<br><br>(No, this is /not/ a camoflaged version of a conversation that has actually happened) Now I can see that poor Lacksi might be upset by not being personally condoned by AnyBoardy (she does look up to her, you know), but I also think AnyBoardy isn&#39;t trying to be offensive and doesn&#39;t understand what she did wrong. I don&#39;t want the PPC to turn into StirrySpoons. Hence, chances - which I think is in there to a great enough degree that this won&#39;t be a problem.<br><br>I just wanted to write some dialogue, really.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To start with, not supporting gay rights does not make you instantly homophobic. When your reasons for not supporting gay rights or LGBT is because they are terrible, sinful and disgusting people, that is homophobic. That is bad. That is what Jacer had done, and she backed this up with blatantly incorrect &#39;facts&#39;, such as that the Church has a right and imperative to intervene in matters of the State. <br><br><br>On a second note, people deserve equal rights, regardless of what they are or where they come from.

            <p>Based on either things that have vanished from the original (I&#39;m assuming this is meant to replace articles 1-6 in their entirety, and leave everything else as it stands), or on inter-linking... or on errata:<br><br>1/ You say &#39;who intentionally oppress, persecute, other, use or otherwise...&#39; Is that meant to be &#39;otherwise abuse&#39;?

            <p>Between vacation, and then the Neshomeh stuff up there, and then just general life. <br><br>1. Discrimination and persecution of any kind will not be tolerated, especially on the basis of sexism, racism, ableism, nationalism, homophobia, transphobia, or religion. We will not tolerate individual people or groups who intentionally oppress, persecute, abuse, other, use or otherwise attack others in any way, shape or form, for any reason.<br><br>2. Do not flame. There is a distinct difference between &#39;I don&#39;t agree with your opinion and I think that your theory is factually wrong&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re an idiot and your opinion is built on lies and stupidity&#39;. If you find that you&#39;re hurling insults around, just stop. In addition, we don&#39;t tolerate anyone making jokes about topics like rape, murder, abuse, bigotry and mental health issues.<br><br>3: People engaged in any violation of the Constitution, particularly Articles 1 &amp;2 will be given at least one actual chance to stop and apologise.any Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance. Giving someone a chance means informing them their behavior is wrong or unwanted as according to our Constitution and why, as per Rule 7. <br><br>4: All respectful opinions that do not attack, insult, or persecute others (see 1) are welcome. We encourage respectful, friendly debates here. Should a debate escalate into an argument for any reason, everyone involved should step back and calm down before continuing. If this cannot be done, it may be best to abandon the conversation entirely.<br><br>5: Everyone on the Board should be respected as people, regardless of who they are. The opinions of a newbie are just as valid and wanted as those of someone here for four years. Everyone deserves respect until they show themselves to be unashamedly disrespectful themselves, which means people who show disrespect and discrimination as per Article 1 do not warrant respect based on those views. However, not warranting respect does not mean they do not warrant politeness. This means you are not allowed to descend into flaming and insulting them, but instead should follow Article 8. <br><br><br>6: If someone says something that seems offensive, but you‚Äôre not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren‚Äôt out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you‚Äôll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant- it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts.<br><br>7: If you find it impossible to get along with another member of the PPC, please take it up in private e-mail. However, the rules of civility and respect do not ouside PPC community spaces or while communicating with other PPCers; harassing others by private means is just as serious as harassing them in public- if not more so, and will be treated as such. Don‚Äôt engage in bullying behaviour, and don‚Äôt say anything about another PPCer you wouldn‚Äôt say to their face. Remember, if you have to ask yourself if you‚Äôve gone too far, you probably have. Everyone should do their best to be as civil as possible while in our community.<br><br>8: The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If you see someone breaking any of the rules and guidelines herein, please ask them to stop (politely- remember Article x!) and explain why. If this doesn&#39;t resolve the situation, you will be backed up - and if it continues, a persistent rule-breaker should be shunned or asked to leave. (If you&#39;re being accused of breaking a rule, take a step back and, if you are in the wrong, stop, apologise, and move on. Grudges are no fun!)<br><br>9: All discovered mimes will be thrown into a pit, which may or may not be filled with various objects such as scorpions upon their availability.<br><br>9.5: There will be no clemency for these mimes until they learn the words.<br><br><br>Think a fourth thread is needed, or is it sorted out enough at this point to just prod it in? Form up top received enough okays, I think, and this is just a refinement. </p>

            <p>Kaitlyn and I have been lucky enough to watch the London Olympics Opening Ceremonies (on the TV, not in the stadium - we&#39;re not /that/ lucky) - or at least up to the Teams&#39; Procession, when I had to go to work - and I was impressed by a lot of things. For instance:<br><br>The entirety of the first segment, the British History piece, was amazing. I thought Brunel was brilliant (though as Kaitlyn pointed out, it must have taken them ages to come up with a historical character who wouldn&#39;t offend <i>anyone</i>), and the transition from the Hobbiton-esque rural scene to the industrial age was brilliantly executed - and utterly captivating. Particularly the dancing men in top hats, loved them - but also all the references (to speak in a fandom way). We spent the whole time going &#39;Ooh, Suffragettes! Ooh, Beatles!&#39; - usually before the BBC commentators got there.<br><br>(And may I just say, they did a wonderful job of shutting up and letting us watch. Much better than the Jubilee, when I think they must have been paid by the word)<br><br>Then there was &#39;Happy and Glorious&#39;, with, er, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II parachuting out of a helicopter alongside James Bond. It kind of has to be seen to be believed.<br><br>Somewhere around here we had the orchestra playing Chariots of Fire, &#39;assisted&#39; by Rowan Atkinson - who managed to be funnier without uttering a word than I think he could be talking.<br><br>Then there was the Children&#39;s Literature &amp; The National Health Service segment, which seems a bit of an odd combination, but worked surprisingly well. J.K. Rowling gave us a lovely reading, and, well, giant Voldemort was driven off by a host of Mary Poppinses. It&#39;s like the most surreal crossover ever.<br><br>(On a side note: given that the Prime Minister is currently trying to sell off large chunks of the NHS, we wondered how comfortable he felt watching the nation extoll its virtues to the world. Not very, I think)<br><br>The closing Four Decades of Music/Television/Technology section seemed a bit crowded, and I didn&#39;t recognise much of the TV - or half the music - but the digitally-aided techno-romance story was very well done. Texts and tweets telling the story were added to the footage of the dancing, presumably live, and while the story wasn&#39;t exactly complex, it did its job - it caught my attention.<br><br>And then they revealed the inventor of the World Wide Web on the stage, which must have been quite a surprise for all the other inventors of the Web. Not sure what was going on there.<br><br>But all in all, great fun to watch, and it didn&#39;t get boring and repetitive. It does leave me wondering when the extravaganzas for opening ceremonies began, though - I know Beijing 08 had one, but I can&#39;t remember hearing about 04 (was that Athens?). Anyone know how long they&#39;ve been going on? Because I think I want to watch them all.<br><br>So did anyone else see it? Or is anyone morally opposed to it? We won&#39;t be watching anything from the Olympics themselves - sport, booooring! - but the ceremony was really something.<br><br>Thoughts/feelings/reactions?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I thought that the opening ceremony was amazing, though I do agree that the Digital age bit was a bit crowded. I think that they were trying to cram as much pop culture into it as possible. The only thing that could have made it better would be if David Tennant had run with the torch, but if that had happened my inner fangirl would have probably been overwhelmed and died. As for the games themselves, the only sports I&#39;m really paying attention to are archery and fencing.</p>

            <p>I was expecting the ceremony to be a big shambles after the taster for it at the end of the last olympics. I was, to say the least, rather pleasantly surprised. I only saw a little of it, but I daresay the use of Mike Oldfield&#39;s &#39;Tubular Bells&#39; as the soundtrack for the aforementioned (in the first post) part had me very pleased. I have always liked Mike Oldfield&#39;s music, and having him live on stage playing possibly his best ever piece, teched-up, was brilliant - especially with J.K.Rowling and representations of various fictional characters there too.<br><br>And SeaTurtle, I&#39;d try YouTube. Everything gets there eventually. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Because a nurse shark would be toast. And so would a sun-bear. Unless it was in with the nurse shark, in which case I think they&#39;d ignore each other. Oh, and the size of the tank, because if it were polar bear vs. tiger shark, if the water were too shallow or the tank too narrow, the shark would be unable to keep swimming and breathing and the bear would be having shark cutlets.<br><br>... And now I&#39;m having the unpleasant thought of what shark cutlets might taste like. Not that I think they&#39;d be disgusting, but because a lot of sharks are protected species, which makes thinking of them as food kind of disgusting for me.</p>

            <p>a number of factors, I put it forth the shark would win. I, of course, am biased towards the shark, because they pop up in movies too much, and the local aquarium has some pretty damn cool sharks.<br><br>Of course, if they were using some bear other than a polar bear, I&#39;d put my money on the bear. All the polar bears I&#39;ve seen are lazy, even during the winter when it&#39;s a heckuva lot colder.<br><br>In conclusion:  Shark wins. :D</p>

            <p>I think the bear would win.  As pointed out, polar bears are very large and very strong, and can swim very well.  A shark&#39;s only attack is to ram into a thing and bite it; a bear&#39;s hit with its front paws, with claws, could do serious damage to any animal, even a shark, without putting its head right in its opponent&#39;s line of fire.<br><br>Besides, polar bears <i>eat</i> fish.</p>

            <p>...that the polar bear will win.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the bear needs to rear up on its hind legs to attack though: I think it can just take a swipe at the shark from the all-fours position.<br><br>An adult polar bear can take on a walrus and win if it really wants to. They are ridiculously strong, very persistent, and are able to swim. <br><br>A shark is essentially a big fish with teeth.</p>

            <p>I think that the shark would win. Bears normal position are on all fours, so it would have to lean against the wall to stay up on it&#39;s hind legs. Plus, whenever it lashes out at the shark, it would fall down to it&#39;s normal position, and would waste time getting back up and leaning up against the wall. During that time, the shark would charge at it. The shark would be faster, and the bear&#39;s strikes would be slower in water.<br><br>I think the real question is how did they get into the same tank to begin with?<br><br>Also: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-iPCTu61Z4"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-iPCTu61Z4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-iPCTu61Z4</a></a></p>
