            <p>...but I&#39;m not sure how much use I&#39;ll be.

            <p>Hi all,<br><br>New guy here. Been lurking around PPC wikia for a few months (probably waaay longer, my memory perception of time is rather skewed) before I decided to join the community.<br><br>I hail from Singapore and have been wandering the western hemisphere (namely US) of the Internet for more than 7 years. I&#39;m currently an undergraduate at DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore, studying as a game programmer. Also, I&#39;m an aspiring writer, but it seems to be getting nowhere (since I haven&#39;t write much, ever =/).<br><br>My current interests are:<br><br>- Gaming<br>- Reading (novels and fanfiction mainly)<br>- Programming<br>- Astronomy<br><br>My reading/media interests includes:<br><br>- Band of Brothers<br>- Tom Clancy (Ryanverse)<br>- Worldwar tetralogy<br>- Colonisation trilogy<br>- Homeward Bound<br>- Axis of Time trilogy<br>- Mass Effect tie-in novels<br>- Destroyermen series (by Taylor Anderson)<br>- My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic<br><br>Also, my ISP at home seems to dislike yourwebapps.com (or vice versa, I&#39;m not really certain) so I can&#39;t post much here (posting from school at the moment).</p>

            <p>I started to study programming after high school because I was interested in making games and the local polytechnics were offering game programming courses. Then after that, I went to DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore. <br><br>What language are you learning right now? I can point you to some resources if you&#39;re keen on learning C/C++.</p>

            <p>The thing is... Hetalia fandom is pretty well split into two groups of fanpeople.<br> There are the people who like it for the history, the intriguing &#39;what if&#39;s&#39; that come up, the comedy, the relationships between the characters... and then there&#39;s the fanbrats who just want to watch men snog. I flatter myself that I fall into the first category.  <br><br></p>

            <p>The premise of Hetalia is that all the nations of the world are people, and most of them are cute, young, sexuality-ambiguous men. Now, natch, you get a LOT of mansnoggy fanbrats in a continuum like that, and there are a LOT of shipwars.<br><br> But the actual show is... less about the romance, more about the comedy. And the history. And just the concept of the nations of the world being people leads to some interesting ideas. <br><br>Example: Since every character is very &quot;My country, right or wrong-&quot; by their very nature- what happens when your country is horribly, hideously wrong, and you KNOW it&#39;s horribly, hideously wrong, but there&#39;s nothing you can do about it? <br><br>Example #2:  What happens when two countries that have been rivals for centuries have to fight a war as allies... and can&#39;t keep one-upping each other, like they&#39;re used to?<br><br>I&#39;ll admit, I ship. But the shipping isn&#39;t what got me into Hetalia.</p>

            <p>In the actual show, everything is played for laughs. The few fight scenes that there are are basically China or Hungary hitting people over the head with a frying pan, or lots of running around and dramatic shouting but no one getting hurt.<br><br>...Except for the bits with the Revolutionary War, which are tragic, and played as such. In THOSE bits, America and England fight as soldiers in their country&#39;s armies. And, because of the way these things work out, of course they wind up facing each other on the battlefield. I think that episode is one of the saddest things you&#39;ll ever see, no matter what you think of America and England&#39;s relationship. <br><br> If you&#39;re doing a &#39;serious&#39; Hetalia fic, that&#39;s usually the way to go. Make the nations foot soldiers in their own armies... and remember, the biggest difference between Hetalia goodfic and Hetalia badfic is that goodficcers do their research. [Badficcers, you know, just want to get to the mansnogging. *shudder* I love slash, but it has to be well-written.]<br></p>

            <p>I have a nice list of fanfic plugage on the wiki, so I don’t think there’s a need to rehash that on the board. So here’s a list of non-fanfic things I think others should check out. I don’t promise they’re good, but I like them, so… This provides a great place for other people to plug similar things themselves. So without further ado…<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ThePianoGuys">The Piano Guys</a><br><br>What is it: Youtube videos, with songs. Really, really good songs, on the cello and piano.<br><br>Why I like it: They’re awesome. So supremely awesome. My personal favorite song is ‘Moonlight,’ with ‘Cello Wars’ and ‘Peponi’ being runners up. (The new Me and My Cello is also really good...) Not only are the songs beautiful, but the videos are impressive.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_bhwCgtXg&amp;list=PL197CF501757AB521&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video">Delicious Cinnamon’s Vietnamese Crystal Playthrough</a><br><br>What is it: A Youtube let’s play of a bootleg Pokemon game<br><br>Why I like it: It’s hilarious. Just… hilarious.<br><br><a href="http://www.thepocalypse.com/comics/welcome-to-the-pocalypse">The Pocalypse</a><br><br>What is it: A flashy webcomic-esque thing.<br><br>Why I like it: It’s a good story, although it’s kind of slow and clunky at the beginning. Still, I like it, and the fact Joe is not a Stu is pretty surprising.<br><br><a href="http://www.urealms.com/content.php?150-Unforgotten-Realms-Episode-1&amp;s=ffd6abdaeedb391844020935b9335ba8">Unforgotten Realms</a><br><br>What is it: A series of Flash videos about two friends playing a fictional roleplaying game.<br><br>Why I like it: It’s really funny, although the quality does peter out after season one. (The first twelve episodes.)<br><br><a href="http://shamusyoung.com/author/?page_id=6">The Witch Watch</a><br><br>What is it: A novel. It’s not free, but enough of it is so that you can determine whether or not you like it before you buy it.<br><br>Why I like it: It’s funny and interesting. It’s generally a good book. It’s about an undead soldier who was accidentally brought back to life trying to save a princess. Takes place in Victorian times. Uh… read the official description. Also, the author is the guy who did DM of the Rings a few years back...<br><br><a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20021104">Girl Genius</a><br><br>What is it: A webcomic<br><br>Why I like it: It’s freaking awesome. I know I’m not the only one here who reads it, so trust me when I say it’s the best steampunk/mad science webocomic with a female protagonist that I know of.<br></p>

            <pre><code>First off, this is a community brought together with a central interest of reading and writing. You will endear yourself by using proper spelling and punctuation. Also, please try a little bit harder to find better literary/media influences than game tie-in novels and Memebase. I &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; want to believe you have more than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I believe someone has already said about how you&#39;re not an agent, and I&#39;m probably not qualified to go into this in length anyway, so I&#39;ll just say you are not roleplaying an agent, your agents will be characters in missions if- IF- you get permission. Which won&#39;t be for at least a month. Sit back, enjoy, maybe read some other work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Finally, random outbursts are not humorous. They never will be. So don&#39;t do that.

            <p>Hello, people! Be to free to call me a greenie, I don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s basically what I am to this site. Admittedly, I came here after someone provided a link as to why the &quot;PPC&quot; ridiculed &quot;badfics&quot;, and I was intrigued. I read the parody of The First Gatekeeper&#39;s &quot;Magic World&quot;, and although I feel very sorry for the guy (I hope his writing skills improve!), I couldn&#39;t help but crack up and bang my head along with Thomas. I&#39;m curious about how this site functions, and I&#39;d be pleased if I could be a part of it. Am I even doing this right? I just saw the words Post Message, and I clicked and typed away. So...yeah.       </p>

            <p>Like Guvnor said, I&#39;m the other author of the &quot;Magic World&quot; parody. Just to check, the link you&#39;re referring to, was that in a review of the story on ff.net, by a guy calling himself Sonic Rhymeboom? If so, this is hilarious because that guy is a troll who we suspect is trying to get people to come yell at us, so the sheer irony of you getting curious and wanting to join up instead is simply delicious. ^<em>^<br><br>In any case, how the site works is pretty simple. This is your basic threaded message board, nothing fancy, where we hang out and talk about stuff and post links when we publish new PPC stories. The PPC was started lo these many moons ago by Jay and Acacia, who wrote the first PPC series, which you can (and should!) read <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">here</a>.<br><br>It&#39;s since expanded enormously, though Jay and Acacia aren&#39;t around anymore. You can find lots of information on our wiki, which has a link up at the top of the Board.<br><br>... It looks like the Sunflower Official has taken over the wiki&#39;s front page, but don&#39;t mind about that. It&#39;s all very meta. Somebody with admin will put it back to normal soon, probably, and you can still find all the most important stuff in the drop-down links right of the sunflower logo at the top of the wiki.<br><br>Let us know if you have any questions. ^</em>^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

The next step is to just hang around and read spin offs and the original series.<br><br>Just by posting on the board you&#39;re a PPCer. <br><br>If you want to write your own spin off, you just need to do the above, and after you feel you have a good idea of what to do and how, and have hung around long enough to feel you&#39;re comfortable, you can ask  for permission. You just need your own writing sample and agent profiles to do that.<br><br>Check out our wiki and just relax and have fun, and again, welcome!</p>

            <p>Wow. It seems I have stumbled into a smorgasbord of randomness (which, if interpreted correctly, is the highest form of awesomeness). Thanks for all the replies, it warmed my heart. Okay, nothing that mushy, but hey, it was cool. My fandoms are: Halo, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings (which I also have an ardent love for), Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, Dresden Files, Alex Rider, Percy Jackson and the Olympians. It&#39;s a lot, but these are the fanfiction categories I&#39;ve worked with. My favorites have got to be Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Narnia, and Halo. What can I say, I mean, I grew up with these amazing franchises. So, yeah. Again, thanks, and &#39;til then!    </p>

            <p>I think I&#39;m quite literally the only other Alex Rider fan here. At least, that I know of.

            <p>I&#39;ll keep that in mind! Alex Rider is awesome, and I&#39;m really glad you like it. I recently made an Alex Rider/Percy Jackson and the Olympians crossover called Benigno Numine on Fanfiction.net. My name on that site is EtchedInDiamond. It&#39;s not the best quality story, and its rushed, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you could critique it for me!   </p>

            <p>Hello, PPCers! My agents are...somehow...going to take on <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7468376/1/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_the_Shadow_Islands_part_1">this</a> fic, which is so bad that they&#39;re not quite sure yet <i>how</i> they&#39;re going to do it. The fic is called &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Shadow Islands part 1&quot; (yes, there is unfortunately a <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7468417/1/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_the_Shadow_Islands_part_2">part two</a>, every bit as incomprehensible as its predecessor). <br><br>Here&#39;s the deal: I can&#39;t understand it.<br><br>I&#39;m not talking about a plot that makes me go, &quot;WTF?&quot; It&#39;s not that the grammar is horrendous (well, okay, the grammar is horrendous, too). No, it is simply that I cannot understand what this story is trying to tell me. And yes, it is in English. I think.<br><br>Don&#39;t believe me? The first paragraph is excerpted below.<br><br>________________<strong><em><br><br><font color="maroon">Jack Sparrow is on his own all over the island. Gibs on his own since the night it was satisfied galumphed off. Jack was walking around by himself. He hoped that a small town on the island Sat Because the boat is the same night in the waves had disappeared. It took a while, but Jack found a small village in the middle of the island. Jack looked around a bit. When he came to a boat shop. He went inside. He gently a very small boat well enough to get rid of this island. He walked over to a man in the shop and asked what the boat cost. 20 gold coins. This is a bargain for such boats. Jack gave him the coins and took the boat. When he had turned the shop, the gentle man that Jack was a pirate. A little later, when Jack had left the city almost he heard horses hooves. He turned with a jerk back. He gently a storm of horses coming towards him. They do not already irritated Jack. And a half minutes later, Jack was in his boat back in prison. Suddenly he gently lie the keys in front of him. He looked at him and his fingers began to go there. But it failed when he tried with his foot. That did not work. So he looked good to him. The cleaner was lucky forget the broom. Jack grabbed the broom. He threaded the key to the broom. Moments later he opened the cage. When he was almost out suddenly stood before him a man with a sword right at him. Jack took his sword and pointed it at him. They fought with swords then jumped on a coach Jack. The man ran after him. Jack jumped on a horse and rode by. The man let him go. When Jack came to the sea took his boat into the water. Jack gently to him that the men already attracted storms. Jack jumped into the boat and sailed away just optijd. The man looked at him a moment with a familiar look and walked away. Jack converted ferry sailed one day at sea. All he did was look at the Black Pearl look into the bottle. A few hours later it started to rain. Jack said: Could it get worse? Then it started to thunderstorm hit Aruba again. Worse than it really can not be said Jack. Suddenly a wave reasachtige. Yes you can do it so Jack said. There goes my boat of 20 gold coins. The wave fell on Jack. The next day, Jack woke up on an island. He looked around and knew that he knew the island. He got up and walked on the beach. He thought the Black Pearl. And he looked over the beach. Suddenly he gently washed with something on a shelf. He ran there. He gently with the bottle in the Black Pearl. He was glad the Black Pearl was not perish! He picked it up. That board was fast a piece of his small boat. He looked around. There was nothing to do on this island. Jack gently that there is only a little green on this island. He went to it. Since he was a while docked at the island. He decided to build a hut alseerst and then a boat or the Black Pearl from the bottle to get. He walked through a small forest. He felt that someone was watching him. Suddenly there is someone jumped from the bushes. Jack shouted. He was kicked to the ground. The woman sat on him. Her eyes jumped fire. Jack recognized that blick. It was Angelica.</font><br></em></strong>________________<br><br>So! My request is twofold. First...suggestions on how to deal with this monstrosity?<br><br>Second...anyone open to a dramatic reading of this badfic a la &quot;legolas by laura&quot;? I think it has potential.</p>

            <p>Well, this is an interesting development.<br><br>The author contacted me via PM, and let me know the following:<br><br>-She acknowledges that the story is bad<br>-She has since stopped writing it<br>-She <em>did</em> use a translator for it<br>-She was <b>9</b> years old at the time of writing it*<br>-She has since taken much more English, and is writing better stories recently, which she hopes can now stay up<br>-She is now of an appropriate age to be on fanfiction.net<br><br>Well, that explains it. I&#39;m going to ask her to take this particular story off, as it is not appropriate for fic written by a grade-schooler to be published on fanfiction.net. This will probably affect the idea of a dramatic reading, but I&#39;m at least glad that she was receptive to feedback and is now improving her writing. (Her two recent stories are much better in quality, so even if they&#39;re still badfic, I&#39;m willing to go easy on her because she&#39;s demonstrated a willingness and ability to improve her writing.)<br><br>* = which just proves that she didn&#39;t know enough English to read fanfiction.net&#39;s TOS.

            <p>Is that the Fangirl Fanfiction Translator is meant to translate fangirlisms, e.g., squee, &quot;OMGs&quot;, l33tspeak, multiple exclamation points in a row, etc. This fic isn&#39;t the result of a fangirl mentality...it&#39;s just plain bad. <br><br>You&#39;re right that I can get a rough idea of what&#39;s happening. Somewhat. The trouble is that around DTE agents, words tend to do exactly what they say, rather than what they roughly mean. (Should be fun for them, muahahahaha.)<br><br>On an unrelated note...this is one of those fics that I would point to as an example of where constructive criticism would be totally useless. The author clearly doesn&#39;t have enough of an understanding of the English language to be posting in that section in the first place. No amount of gentle grammar suggestions will fix the fact that she had to run her fic through a computer translator in order to post it.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s an argument that any fanfiction written by a fangirl is a Fangirl Fanfiction, and therefore subject to translation by the FFT. Since that&#39;s entirely beside the point, though, you could always have them try it in desperation and see what happens just for the heck of it. *g*<br><br>Regarding concrit, perhaps we disagree on what concrit is. I do agree that gentle grammar suggestions would be useless here, but &quot;The readability of your story would be vastly improved if you learned and followed the rules of the language in which you&#39;re trying to write it&quot; is concrit in my book, and is something they might benefit from being told.

Tolkein a Mary Sue.&quot;<br><br>Acacia sighed. &quot;Normally, what species is the case this time she, and she is doing to break it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;People magically transported from the earth, along with her ​​band she joined STUDY scholarships ......... and you will love this. She Boromir strung together while enjoying their with Legolas. &quot;Jay looked to the side of his partner, hoping that this information will not be too worrisome.<br><br>Acacia glared. &quot;Let me see this,&quot; she said, pushing Jay out of his seat without waiting for an answer. She began pressing buttons seemingly at random, staring at the screen as the hope to write it off by force from an absolute perspective, then stand up. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go then!&quot;<br><br>Jay exploit something on the console, causing a strange cry. Flicker rather unimpressive appearance in the air, participating in the emergence of a rectangular doorway. &quot;Come on, Acy,&quot; she said, using her nickname frightened friend. &quot;Let&#39;s hunt some Sue&quot;.<br><br><hr>
<br>Jay is a guy, apparently. I like the bit about the &quot;ongoing conspiracy,&quot; though!<br><br>~Neshomeh, who will probably now spend hours playing with Google Translate.</p>

            <p><i>There&#39;s an argument that any fanfiction written by a fangirl is a Fangirl Fanfiction, and therefore subject to translation by the FFT. Since that&#39;s entirely beside the point, though, you could always have them try it in desperation and see what happens just for the heck of it. *g*</i><br><br>Hmm, you might be on to something, there.<br><br>You&#39;re right; I think we do disagree on definitions of concrit. For me, concrit is only possible when I can make a suggestion that would improve the story as written. In other words, at the moment of my writing the concrit, the author must <i>actually have the power</i> to make her story more readable. In this case, I would argue that she does not.<br><br>If I took your example and told the author to learn and follow the rules of the language in which she&#39;s trying to write, could she do anything to apply that suggestion to <i>this</i> story in the next, say, two weeks or so? Not really. She would need a few more years of English classes and much more practice writing stories at home before even <i>attempting</i> to publish something online in English. And even if she were to do so, the delay and development in her own writing would mean that Attempt #2 would be a completely different story from Attempt #1. The other option, posting the fic in her own language, would have a different story ID, a different syntactical structure...again, it would be a different story altogether. (I&#39;m in favor of the latter.)<br><br>Concrit, in my opinion, has to do with addressing the contents and merit of a story, not questioning whether it belongs in this section of fanfiction.net in the first place. I would apply the same line of thought to, say, an RPF that showed up on the Pit, or a piece of original fiction &quot;inspired&quot; by Pirates of the Caribbean, however well written it was. With this fic, my trying to give constructive criticism would go something like this: &quot;Your first sentence is wrong, and here&#39;s why. Your second sentence is wrong, and here&#39;s why. Your third sentence...is this even a sentence?!&quot; Not helpful to either us or the author, since she wouldn&#39;t know how to make an improvement.<br><br><i>If no one ever points out that nobody can understand their story like this, or that Google Translate is not a reliable or acceptable alternative to actual learning, how should they know?</i><br><br>...Common sense? :P<br><br>I can, of course, review her story, asking her to remove the fic or post it in her own language. I can also point out the pitfalls of using a translator. To me, though, that&#39;s not constructive criticism; it&#39;s just housework for the fandom and fanfiction.net.<br><br>Hope that makes sense!<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>Maybe it&#39;s an issue of defining concrit in terms of its potential usefulness in and of itself, rather than in terms of how likely a given author is to use it.<br><br>When I think of concrit, I tend to include both suggestions for how to improve the current story <i>and</i> how the author can improve their writing in general for the future; I tend to think the two are inextricably linked. Improvement right now could be impossible for a variety of reasons, though—there are cases like this, where the author doesn&#39;t (currently) have the skill required, but also cases of the piece in question being an old and/or completed work that the author has no intention of revising again simply because they&#39;ve moved on. Concrit of a finished or abandoned piece can still guide the author to greater success in a future work, so even though improvement right now is impossible, it&#39;s still constructive to provide recommendations for improvement later.<br><br>Whether it&#39;s worth the time to do this for a given fanwriter is a personal decision, but I still think it counts as concrit regardless of their ability or inclination to use it.<br><br>Re. common sense: If only it were!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>For myself, an author&#39;s receptivity and/or the ability to improve the story in question are inextricably linked to my giving constructive criticism. If I feel that it is next to impossible for a story to improve because of anything I say about it, it makes me think I&#39;m wasting my time critiquing it, instead of having fun with a PPC/MST of it.<br><br>But in this case, my reviewing the story was a very good thing! I won&#39;t call it constructive criticism (at least, it might be by your definition, but not by mine), but there&#39;s a good chance that the story will be taken off, and I can say with confidence that the author&#39;s writing has improved. That&#39;s not something you can say about every writer, especially on the Pit.<br><br>On another note...<br><br>Have you ever noticed that the people who seem to turn to writing goodfic (or at least, less awful badfic) have always been the younger writers? It seems, at least to me, that despite pro-Sue groups harping on the fact that we criticize works by younger fans, the younger writers are the ones who benefit the most from our criticism. Conversely, the longest, most painful Suethor diatribes I have seen have usually been from the writers in their late twenties or early thirties (I know there are several in the &quot;insanity&quot; memories of Deleterius). My guess? It&#39;s much more galling to be a 33-year-old who&#39;s just discovered she writes dreck than to be a 13-year-old who&#39;s discovered the same thing. <br><br>In fact, the only other author who responded to my concrit favorably was the you-Sue author who&#39;s Sue stole Jack&#39;s ship. She was 13, and she reformed her OC! So, to sum up, thanks for reminding me to send the review, and I see no reason why we can&#39;t have Constructive Criticism: Definitions One and Two.<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>... how the heck did &#39;galumphed&#39; make it in there? That&#39;s a Jabberwocky word, no translator should just throw it in there.<br><br>(Which makes me wonder: when they translated <i>Looking Glass</i> into other languages, what did they <i>do</i> with Jabberwocky?)<br><br>The question for you is, are you going to try and recreate the story as the author intended it and kill it that way, or (possibly more interesting, but very surreal) rewrite it as literally as possible? Which would lead to something like:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Jack Sparrow is on his own, spread across the island. Gibs is also on his own, since the night It-Was-Satisfied galumphed off.<br><br>---That Night---<br><br>Jack was walking around by himself. He hoped there was a small town in the island of Sat Because, since the boat Is-The-Same-Night had disappeared into the waves.<br><br>It took a while, but Jack found a small village in the middle of the island. He looked around a bit. When he came to a boat shop, a man with the unlikely name of He went inside. Mr. He gently touched a small boat - but the simple touch was well-nigh enough to get rid of the island, for it was a magic boat.<br><br>As the remains of the shop floated on the water, Mr. He walked over to a gentle bystander and asked what the boat cost. &#39;20 gold coins,&#39; the bystander said, which Mr. He  realised was a bargain for magic boats of this kind. Mr He., noticing Jack clinging to the doorframe, told him all about the boat.<br><br>Jack handed the bystander the 20 gold coins, and climbed into the boat. He pushed off from the shop so hard that it began to turn, and the gentle bystander realised that Jack was... a pirate!<br><br><hr>
<br><br>... which is kind of an awesome story, really. But would probably require a lot of explanation on your part - and a lot of work.<br><br>I agree that it totally needs a dramatic reading.

            <p>I had several questions regarding all sorts of things PPC or mission related, and I’ve managed to get most of them answered by looking through the wiki, but I still have a couple left, and there’s one or two bits I want to check to see if I’ve understood it correctly.<br><br>1) Regarding the neuralyzer, my understanding is that it wasn’t used in the Original Series, because the damage wasn’t bad enough to need it back then, but it has now become a requirement in LOTR and others. I was considering having an agent that had been banned from using a neuralyzer, and so could only work in the more obscure continua as a result. I was thinking that further punishment could take the form of making sure that these rarer continua don’t degenerate to the point where neuralyzers are required, so having to sweep a forest with a metal detector to pick up all of those bullets that the ‘average guy/girl who fell through into a random fantasy setting’ left all over the place, and other stuff like that. Basically just going into a little more detail about the clean-up required, beyond just the assassination of the Sue. <br>So my questions for this really are; have I understood it correctly? And does what I suggested sound OK/entertaining?<br><br>2) I get that agents should bring as little non-canonical equipment on a mission as possible, but I&#39;m just wondering how strict the definition of ‘non-canonical’ is. For example, in the anime Trigun various weapons are shown, mostly handguns of various sorts, as well as things like shotguns and automatic rifles, grenades are mentioned, etc. So the weapons technology is broadly similar to current levels. I can’t ever recall seeing any actual mass production sniper rifles, despite the fact that they should have the skills and technology to produce them. Does this mean that my agents shouldn’t take a sniper rifle into the Trigun continuum? (My personal feeling is that a sniper rifle would be OK, because they could well exist given what is known about the setting, but that something like a plasma-rifle would be banned, because there’s nothing like that at all in the canon). Just wondering what you guys think / if this sort of thing has come up before.<br><br>3) Regarding Betas and Permission; can I use a beta? Should I use a beta? To clarify; is the piece of writing I submit as part of my permission request supposed to reflect purely my own ability to physically write well, or does ‘writing ability’ include things like how well you listen to your beta?<br><br>4) Finally, I would like to claim this fic from the Old Kingdom for my first mission (assuming that I am granted permission) :<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783265/1/bWhen_b_bMagic_b_Collides"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783265/1/bWhen_b_bMagic_b_Collides">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4783265/1/bWhen_b_bMagic_b_Collides</a></a> The story itself has a multitude of SPaG errors but I’m not quite sure about the nature of the OC(s) involved. The main OC appears to have access to a unique type of magic which is far more powerful (or he is a far more powerful user of it) than any of the canonical magic, and his influence does seem to be felt by the canon characters as they don’t seem to be quite as intelligent as they should be. Being male, he doesn’t have an overly speshul description (in fact, now that I think of it, I&#39;m not sure he’s actually described at all), so I was suspecting a Stu. But according to the page for Stus they are written to be the ‘best’ at what they do. Now, this OC is a bad guy, so he’s probably going to be beaten by the OOC canons, which seems a bit self-defeating for a Stu (fic is unfinished and I’d hate to try and guess were it’ll be going). So my question is; is this some kind of rarer Antagonist!Stu that the DMSE&amp;R might be interested in examining, is it simply a normal Stu and I’ve misunderstood the definition, or is it just a poor OC in a badly written fic?<br>Although I’ve said I’d like to claim this fic, I haven’t done anything about that the wiki, mainly because I&#39;m not sure how to edit a page. I&#39;m aware that there’s a tutorial on it, I just haven’t read it through it yet. Hopefully I’ll get around to that soon, as I believe that it’s OK to claim something before receiving permission? <br><br>Apologies for the massive wall of text, but I thought it was best to put all of my questions in one post rather than spamming the board with several at once. <br></p>

<li>To be honest? It is up to you. If you feel that the remaining stuff is minor enough (a few bullet casings, handgun, etc, etc,) then you can have it fixed with the canon when the main offenders are removed. As for the scenario you proposed, you can absolutely use it! Having to sweep a forest completely for bullet casings would be funny for a punishment. Granted, no one wants to read the entire excruciating process, but a small scene with the agent bemoaning the fact that he/she has to (and possibly more) would definently be welcome! <br><br>Being creative in how you handle missions is always a good idea!<br><br>2. I have only briefly glanced at Trigun, but if the agents were to use the sniper rifle, and the canon (or the canon itself) could identify it as a sniper rifle, or gun, then you should be fine. <br><br>Star Wars, for another example, has guns. Slugthrowers, and based on the wiki page, they have around the same variety we do. The only thing is they are less favored compared to blasters and other energy weapons. So, while using a gun would not violate any rules, it would be out of the norm.<br><br>To be completely safe, do a bit of canon research and see if said weapon (be it gun, sword, or some other strange implement) have some basis in the canon, and wouldn&#39;t raise too many eyebrows. <br><br>3. Yes, and yes. Betas are your best friend, and they are there to help you. It IS best to always go over your work first, as a habit. Picking off the easier mistakes makes their job all the easier!  While not a requirement, they do give you an extra net for your work. <br><br>As for your permission piece, using a Beta is allowed. It is ALWAYS a good idea to listen to your Beta&#39;s thoughts, and while the final say is always up to you, they are there only to help you.<br><br>4. Claiming a fic is perfectly fine, as long as you leave a note mentioning that you still need permission. As for the OC... he COULD be a Stu. They don&#39;t really have to be the best at anything, it is more about being believable. Is his strength in magic (or that type) something that baffles others? <br><br>I hope this helped. if not, feel free to leave a reply and I&#39;ll be sure to try and help some more! I can also be found in the IRC (link at the top) around 7PM or later most nights. <br><br>Here is a link to the Beta Readers Directory, in case you need it. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory</a></a></li>

            <p>For point 1, I&#39;ve had a few more thoughts about the possible reasons for doing that level of detailed clean-up, which are in my reply to ShatteredSanity&#39;s comments below. <br>I agree, actually writing out such a search would make for dull reading, so I&#39;d probably just try and handle it with some dialouge once the agents were back in their RC, for example:<br><br>&quot;Three hours! Three hours spent searching through that damn forest, just becuase &#39;Litte Miss Speshul&#39; dropped her iPod.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, would you rather waste three hours, or go ask the SO for a different punishment?&quot;<br>&quot;...the searching, I guess. But next time I&#39;m bringing a metal detector.&quot;<br><br>For 2, cool; that question arose from a fic I read (can&#39;t find the link at the moment, but hoping to retrieve it for use as a future mission) that had a Sue that was so speshul she could stop bullets, with her mind, as opposed to the more traditonal method of body armour. She was also an ace gunfighter (obviously). I figured one of the best ways of dealing with her would be a surprise attack; one agent up close to read the charge list, with the other a long way off with a high powered rifle. Can&#39;t stop a bullet if you&#39;re not aware of it. <br>Sniper rifles should be OK in the canon, becuase just about every other type of gun is there, and there&#39;s no reason (that I&#39;m aware of) that snipers couldn&#39;t exist in the setting. <br><br>I&#39;m glad that I can use a Beta for my permission piece; I thought that&#39;d be the case, given that this community is all about writing well. I wanted to make sure of that before actually asking for a Beta, just in case the permission piece was meant to be solely what I could do myself. Thanks for the link to the list of Betas. <br><br>As for point 4, I&#39;ll make sure to tag my claim as pending (as soon as I actually get over my nervousness and dare to make changes to the wiki). Regarding the OC, yeah a couple of canon characters that should know a lot about magic are surprised at the strength/ability displayed. I&#39;m fairly certain now that this is indeed a Stu, which means that the agents I&#39;m working on can find a home in the DMS. <br><br>Thanks again for your help.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not the best person to answer, being new myself, but having read <i>far</i> too much of the PPC Wiki, I can say a bit.<br><br>For 3... It&#39;s probably best to get a beta.

            <p>I&#39;ll try to answer to the best of my ability, but a more experienced boarder should make sure that these are correct.<br><br>1. My assumption is that canon snaps back into place once the main offenders have been taken care of. For example: In one of PC&#39;s missions, a character is in a high school setting when they aren&#39;t a high schooler. Once the Sue was killed, the character&#39;s clothing switched back to the way it should be.<br>For non canonical locations, I believe DOGA takes care of that. I doubt the agents would be expected to clean up every bullet in a forest, but the gun would remain and have to be taken out.<br><br>2. I believe that it would be okay. If a character from that canon looked at a sniper rifle, would they know that it&#39;s a gun?<br>Agents that go to the Harry Potter continuum CAN bring guns, because muggles use them, and muggles are part of the canon. I assume the rule is that if it&#39;s plausible for a weapon to exist naturally in the canon, then it&#39;s okay.<br><br>3. Beta&#39;s are allowed, but don&#39;t forget to go over it yourself. That&#39;s what I did. *blushes*<br><br>5. Wait no, 4. You ARE allowed to claim a fic even without permission. Just be sure to put it on the list and have a note that says something like &quot;Pending permission&quot; next to your name.<br>For the second part of your question, a Stu is a Stu is a Stu. They don&#39;t have to be the BEST at everything for them to be a Stu, that&#39;s just a common trait.<br>As for the wiki, I know what that&#39;s like. Every time I edit something I&#39;m always scared i&#39;m going to break the page. To edit a page, hit edit. You probably already knew that though. Then, just follow the examples of the things already on the page.<br><br>Thank you for asking so nicely, and for looking for the answers before you ask. Hopefully this will clear some of your questions up. If it didn&#39;t, feel free to ask more!</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;m often unsure whether or not to try and answer any questions posted here, seeing as I&#39;m so new, but everything you&#39;ve said makes perfect sense to me. <br><br>With regards to point 1, a personal theory that I&#39;m working on (which one of my agents will probably hold regardless of whether it&#39;s actually true or not), is that after the all the major stuff has been dealt with, the canon can handle the little stuff. But that the way it does this is to absorb it, so the actual object disappears from view, and can never be stumbled upon by any of the canon characters, but it forms a sort of &#39;narrative cancer&#39; that still damages the continuum. The more &#39;cancerous&#39; it gets, the more outside stuff has to be removed before the canon can reassert itself. So by cleaning up as much as possible, rather than just as much is required, it&#39;s possible to keep the canon &#39;healthier&#39; and stave off the time where it becomes necessary to remove memories and skills as well as the physical artefacts. <br><br>I&#39;ll probably just have one for two favourites that they obsess over cleaning up as much as possible, but deal with anything else in the normal way. <br><br>With 2, there is a slight difference between the worlds of Harry Potter and Trigun, in that HP is set in the real world, with a twist (in that magic exists), so anything available in the real world would be available in HP. With Trigun, they&#39;re on a different planet, so not everything from Earth is necessarily going to be available. But I think that seeing as how every other type of weapon seems to be there, the concept of a sniper rifle should easily exist, and so the canon shouldn&#39;t have any problem with the concept of sniping a Sue from half a mile away. <br><br>Thanks for confirmation on the Beta&#39;s.<br><br>With 5/4, I was fairly sure it was still a Stu, but wanted to check as it&#39;s going to be my first mission. Wouldn&#39;t have wanted to have written up a couple of DMS agents, sporked the fic, and then have someone say &#39;That&#39;s good, but it wasn&#39;t actually a Sue/Stu, so it&#39;d probably have been better for agent from the Department of Floaters to deal with it&#39;, or something like that.<br>With regards to the editing; that&#39;s exactly how I feel. I mean, it&#39;s just text, so surely there&#39;s a limit on how complicated it can be, but I was just looking at it thinking &#39;what if it all goes horribly wrong?&#39; Still, if I don&#39;t try it at some point, my only other option would be to pester people on the board to do it for me, and I imagine that would get annoying very quickly. <br><br>*goes away to contemplate that fearsome &#39;edit&#39; button*</p>

            <p>Hello all.<br><br>It has been some time sonce I was last here, even more so when I was writing for the PPC. <br><br>Inspired by the &quot;Message&quot; recently dispatched and suddenly hearing the chirping of the muse bug in my ears, I have started a short three part series outlining a bit about my characters and how they eventually met.<br><br>The first part, dealing with Lothar Roth, ex-Helghast, can be read here:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nghtCy34G1rfy0CQP6tkHMEAJzYAPx--6a7VyyXEHd4/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nghtCy34G1rfy0CQP6tkHMEAJzYAPx--6a7VyyXEHd4/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nghtCy34G1rfy0CQP6tkHMEAJzYAPx--6a7VyyXEHd4/edit</a></a>#<br><br>I understand that it is a bit on the short side (about a thousand words), so any feedback about my writing style, charactersation and so on would be greatly appreciated. I will return in future and expand on this once the three parts get going fully.<br><br>Thanks and enjoy!<br><br>CDHammer</p>

            <p>Overall, I think this is a pretty decent piece. You do a good job setting the mood through description and word choice without delving too much into purple prose.<br><br>One of my problems with the story is almost all of it is told to the audience rather than shown. I personally would have preferred to actually <i>see</i> Lothar&#39;s final fight and recruitment first-hand, rather than through a narrative flashback. The story just feels a bit dry as it stands.<br><br>The other big issue I had was with the ultimate act of recruitment. As far as I understand, PPC agents don&#39;t just swing through continuums looking for ordinary people to recruit. Most agents that I&#39;ve seen were either rescued from badfic or fell through naturally-occuring plot holes. I&#39;m sure there are a few exceptions scattered throughout PPC history, but this instance just seemed a bit odd to me. What made Lothar so exceptional as to warrant rescue?<br><br>A bit more explanation would have been appreciated, too. Helghast go through massive amounts of propaganda indoctrination, if the games are any judge. How was Lothar able to shake off his programming so easily?<br><br>Other than that, I just had some little nitpicks. You mix up your tenses in a few spots (&quot;have&quot; and &quot;had&quot; seemed to be the most common in this regard.) There&#39;s also a few redundant moments here and there (&quot;Like his brethren, he was armed and clad in the same fashion of his kin,&quot; for example.) Finally, the developer of Killzone is Guerrilla Games, not Gurrilla.<br><br>I look forward to seeing your next installments.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s actually not that terrible, I don&#39;t think. I could see all the characters acting like this, and Celestia&#39;s motivation behind... well, that actually makes a certain amount of sense when you think about it. That, and Alice looks relatively IC.<br><br>Though, it looks like they were going to continue it, which would&#39;ve been a good judge for how well the crossover would&#39;ve worked.<br><br>I mean, I am familiar with American McGee&#39;s Alice, and it really makes me wonder how this crossover could work. On the one hand, you have MLP, which is a rather bright and cheery continuum.<br><br>And on the other hand, American McGee&#39;s Alice is... it&#39;s actually <i>very</i> grim-dark. Just the art design alone is pretty doggone crazy, but the stuff you see in the game itself gets incredibly creepy. Granted, I have seen grim-dark continua get crossed with MLP before in a context that actually manages to incorporate the tones of both continua without it feeling like there&#39;s a jarring tone change, but it&#39;s really hard to do right, and I don&#39;t know if this fic could manage it.<br><br>But it managed that far, so... yeah.</p>

            <p>... is pretty cool, actually! I enjoyed it. Makes me wonder, did the Infernal Train turn up <i>because</i> Alice was there?

            <p>Basically... this is the darkest, nastiest, most twisted version of the Alice Mythos you can come up with, where everyone&#39;s either insane or a victim of the insane serial killers.

            <p>Having read it again (after seeing all the comments other people were leaving), I&#39;d agree with you. <br><br>I still think it&#39;s odd that most of the ponies seem to have forgotten, or be unaware of the fact, that they used to live in Wonderland, but the way it&#39;s actually written is quite good. <br><br>My previous opinion was formed mostly in ignorance; I&#39;ll do a bit of research before commenting on something I&#39;m not familiar with next time.</p>

            <p>Just less than desirable for a writer. <br><br>As for Agents, actually, venting spleen can be amusing. It all depends on how you handle it. So save the cries of blasphemy until you&#39;re writing missions, and then craft them with humour. That, in fact, is half the reason most of us write for the PPC! </p>

            <p>Heh. The other &#39;problem&#39; is that this!Holmes has a massive Thing for both Watson and Irene. Basically, he&#39;s tetchily overprotective of EVERY major character in the continuum. If he gets assigned to a badfic in the Holmes continuum, he will go MAD and show NO mercy. <br><br>...It falls to his hyperactive, irresponsible dwarf partner to make sure that the Sues/Stus get charged, and to stop Holmes from indulging in Random Acts of Senseless Violence.</p>

            <p>So the PPC has lots o&#39; folks who live all over the place. Most of these places have something cool nearby, I&#39;m sure. So I had an idea. What if did some kind of post card exchange?<br><br>The idea is simple: a list of interested people will each have someone randomly selected for them to send a post card to, who is also on that list. So if you participate, you will be, theoretically, sending one post card and receiving one post card. <br><br>I know, its a strange idea, and it has issues. The biggest is that you have to trust an internet person with your address. I don&#39;t know if anyone would actually be interested, but I figured I&#39;d throw this out there. Couldn&#39;t hurt. </p>

            <p>So here&#39;s the official update on things. We now have 12 people officially participating. I will keep &#39;registration&#39; open until tomorrow evening, at which point I will have the final list of people participating.<br><br>Since no-one objected, and two people supported the idea, I think we&#39;re going with sending me all of your addresses. After that, I will give one address to each person, and they will send their post card to that address. If you are participating, please email me your address no later than Sunday night. My email, once again, is guvnorofspace AT SYMBOL HERE gmail DOT PERIOD THING com.<br><br>Ideally, I&#39;d like everyone to have their post card into the mail within a week of getting the address of the person they are sending it to. This is because procrastination is bad! Please let me know when you mail your post cards.<br><br>As to the question of how to address them: If you are not comfortable giving your real name, that is probably okay. Real names are of course ideal, but just a first name and a last initial should work. &#39;Current Resident&#39; I know will work, but that means its legally addressed to anyone living at home with you, so I would discourage that.<br><br>Any comments? Questions? Objections? If so, comment!</p>

            <p>My experience is that the post office will deliver without a name, even if you&#39;re supposed to have one.  <br><br>Still, better to be safe than sorry. A first name would be good, if you aren&#39;t comfortable giving out your full name. Perhaps a last initial, too. &#39;Current Resident&#39; is also an option, although that would be kind of strange on a post card.</p>

            <p>Including myself, and not including Desdenelle (since he has not committed yet) we have eight people who have agreed to this. So I think I&#39;ll give it a couple more days and then declare this (first round?) done. <br><br>I think I want to work address collection like this: You all email me your addresses. Why? It&#39;s simple. I can then distribute them when I have all of them. <br><br>The other option is to email the person I tell you is sending you a post card your address. However, that involves multiple people posting their email addresses and is slightly more complicated. The other downside is that I kind of want it to be a surprise who you get a postcard from, and having to give someone (other than me) your address ruins that surprise. Still, it is perfectly doable, and I might be the only one who cares about surprise. So now I ask: What do you guys think?<br><br>Email address: guvnorofspace AT SYMBOL gmail PERIOD OR DOT com</p>

            <p>It also involves trusting me with your address, but only me. You can have the person who gets you to mail me the post card in a regular envelope, and then I&#39;ll mail it from there.

I sporked one of mine in this. Sort of my greatest shame. Sadly it&#39;s one of the only full length fics I&#39;ve ever finished. It&#39;s baaaaad. Happy Tree Friends fandom, filled with OCs that take up the spotlight, a few of which vanish, never to be heard from again. I was fourteen when I wrote the monstrosity, couldn&#39;t bring myself to delete it in the end because... I dunno. Sentimental reasons or something.<br><br>Enjoy!</p>

            <p><b>WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS. AVERT YOUR EYES, UNREAD MASSES.</b><br><br>I really like this story. I say &#39;story&#39; as opposed to &#39;mission,&#39; as the actual mission itself felt a little rushed. This feels most obvious to me when the action jumps ahead about seventeen chapters with only a quick aside and a recap from the agents to fill in the audience. I&#39;m not saying that we should have been walked through the entirety of the fic, but it doesn&#39;t quite hold together as well as it could have. It might have been better just to forget about the one-line reference to the pyrokinetic battle and instead just cut directly to the shell-shocked agents trying to wrap their heads around they have witnessed over the past seventeen chapters.<br><br>Besides that minor point, though, the rest of this story was nigh-on golden for me. The characterization was great, and I appreciated how you were able to bring in background information in a fairly natural way. There were no obviously shoehorned-in details to distract from the character interactions.<br><br>I think you did a pretty good job with all the postmodern fourth-wall-breaking stuff, especially once you got into that bit at the end. Metafictional elements can be a tricky thing to handle, but I thought everything you did was executed in a well-constructed manner.<br><br>Finally, there were a lot of little details I thought were fantastic. Deuce referring to his author as &quot;Mom,&quot; the literal plot bunny - just awesome.<br><br>Well done! I can&#39;t wait to see what story you finish up next.</p>

            <p>Firstly, thanks for the review. I love concrit. Concrit is my blood.<br><br>I admit I panicked a little because some of my old missions felt a bit like glorified MSTs, and I always worry about how much of the badfic to include in the narrative. Guess I used too little this time. Though to be honest, the purpose of this mission was to develop Adder and Deuce a bit more, because I haven&#39;t spent as much time on their backgrounds as I have, say, Caleb. So I&#39;m glad I pulled that off, because I was worried it might sound like I pulled it out of thin are and threw it in.<br><br>Thanks!</p>

            <p>&#39;Ello there! I&#39;m hoping one of your knows something about precedent &amp; the West Wing re: the PPC. *waves at Chatvert*<br><br>I&#39;ve got all the Wiki stuff, but the mini bit doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>The West Wing mini has been established as an Elefunky through the precedent of the mission Halloween, handled by agents Kitty Callahan and Alec Trevelyan.<br><br>What do elefunkies have to do with the West Wing? Normally, minis are taken from the universe, so shouldn&#39;t it be a mini-assistant or a mini Secret-Service agent or even a mini computer or mini pen? I don&#39;t understand it. Did I miss something important?<br><br>Also, is there any OFU for the West Wing? I don&#39;t actually see a giant need for one, because most WW writers are pretty good, but I had an idea, so now I&#39;m poking around. Can I make one?<br><br>Can anyone tell me about the precedent of fics about non-OFUM students writing fan fiction? <br><br>If I write and mention OFUs that I don&#39;t make and don&#39;t actually exist as long as I&#39;m not actually in the OFU and do cite Miss Cam, is that okay?<br><br>Am I making any sense?<br><br>And finally (since I&#39;m hoping Chatvert is out there), on an entirely different subject, how&#39;s the Langley OFU going? And the adoption of mini-Jackals? And have you seen Saisoto&#39;s deviant art of Sherlock Holmes? And what can you do with an International Relations degree (it sounds really fun but I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with myself)? And please don&#39;t think I&#39;m a stalker but I had questions and you put your tumblr on the Wiki, so yeah. And lo, the geeks shall inherit the earth... Did you freak out when Star Trek was mentioned on TWW?<br><br>The crazy n00b plotter is back, my friends. Back in full force. *evil laugh*</p>

            <p>I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER.<br><br>1. Re: Elefunkies - I decided to combine the Party symbols of Democrat Donkey and Republican Elephant for the Elefunkies. I didn&#39;t want to use mini-humans (&#39;cause I find that frankly gimmicky) and mini-inanimate objects have always struck me as odd. I figured that the parties themselves were as close to monsters as anything in the show!<br>1a. I have the second part of that mission written up as well and just need to revise it before it can be posted. owo<br><br>2. No OFU, but I&#39;d gladly assist with one. I wanted to run one but my plate&#39;s full up enough as is!<br><br>3. Re: Non-OFUM students writing fanfic, not sure what you mean...and personally I wouldn&#39;t reference OFUs that are as-yet nonexistent because I wouldn&#39;t want to step on any potential toes. But that is just me.<br><br>4. Oh my God, it&#39;s been insane but I am working on it. It&#39;s been going through a lot of revision. Mini-Jackals are up for adoption if y&#39;all want one. No I have not seen this dA but I am intrigued now. And an IR degree basically makes you good for employment at an NGO, IGO, or government agency. My personal focus is International Security (which I can most likely trace back to Josh&#39;s obsession with the smallpox data in The Crackpots and These Women) and nonproliferation. I also feel that Star Trek could have been handled better on TWW...we Trekkers are maligned enough without outside help, lol. But it kicks ass that our president is a Trek fan and blerg blerg my tumblr isn&#39;t interesting also it is full of slash blerg<br><br>blerg</p>

            <p>THANK YOU. (Leo McGarry, Leo McGarry, Leo McGarry!)<br><br>1) Okay.

I&#39;m surprised people aren&#39;t freaking out more over biowarfare after I wrote a paper on it for school-isn&#39;t it cheaper and more accessible and more suited to terrorist-types than nukes? *the n00b speaks* I am highly accustomed to avoiding slash if it&#39;s distasteful slash, so it&#39;s all good over here.<br><br>What is this blerging?<br><br>Um, yeah, also--I was that Maelwys person way back when. Heh. *waves* I didn&#39;t have an email, so I couldn&#39;t get an ff.net account, so, yeah. *headscratch*<br><br>Expect us to be da men, Toby-style, soon enough--I SHALL JOIN YOU *insert ebil* laugh here* Ahem. Exercising cautious optimism over here.<br><br>*coined by Artix Games, ebil is basically evil, but cuter, embodied by a conspiratorial blue bunny-like thing with a little skull-staff named Zorbak.<br><br>And how do you feel about Lustbader?

            <p>Communities change over time. Sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse. There are reasons that the Board doesn&#39;t have those large longspanning conversations anymore.<br><br>The board isn&#39;t equipped for this sort of numbers. Look through the last few pages. At any given point, an extremely large portion of the threads are newbies posting a thread to say hi. Or posting another new badfic thread. There isn&#39;t much room for actual discussion or conversation or games in all that with how we are currently organized. <br><br>The PPC is <i>unique</i>. Or at least, it was. We can&#39;t have those sort of conversations due to how many newbies are around that have no idea what&#39;s going on or what it&#39;d be about. We can&#39;t get them involved before another pack shows up! There&#39;s no time or space for a round of Fill the Plotholes, or a seasonally appropriate fight with water or snow or mud. <br><br>Beyond that, most of them aren&#39;t used to operating with something that allows for multi-linear  multi-person conversations. How are we supposed to have any long conversations about anything when there&#39;s so many new people around? We don&#39;t know them. They don&#39;t know most PPC stuff. Fandoms in common are becoming increasingly rarer. <br><br>A nice long discussion about LotR? Barely any LotR fans around anymore. The first part of the Hobbit is going to likely be in theaters by the end of this year. There&#39;s been a vast flow of articles, trailers, and shots from the filming. None of this has been on the board. <br><br>A long conversation about the PPC? How are they supposed to take part? So many of them are so green they are still asking stuff that would be answered if read the original series, or even the newbie stuff on the wiki. <br><br>I would love to see actual discussion on the board, but there&#39;s so much that we can&#39;t really do anymore because there&#39;s not the necessary base of knowledge. <br><br>It also prevents those long fun things, too.<br><br>Snowball fight? Well, that&#39;s not going to last very long. It&#39;ll drop off the front page within a couple days because of newbies wandering in. <br><br>Shipfic fest? The last one didn&#39;t last very long either, between the aforementioned newbie thread swarm that seems to be a constant these days, and the newbies being reluctant to take part. <br><br>Traditions can only be maintained when there is a sizeable enough group to continue it and that know about it. You can&#39;t argue about things no longer happening when people barely know each other or know about things that are in theory held in common.<br><br>The PPC&#39;s current system is obsolete. We cannot have this many people <i>and<i> have it be rules and order minimal <i>and</i> be on a single board like this, but still expect everything to go on perfectly fine, because things are not actually going on perfectly fine as it is. <br><br>I just spent the last few hours looking through the last several pages of the board. The criticisms you had about the board as it is now are very minute. They don&#39;t address the real problem. If we don&#39;t make some changes, rehaul where we have the PPC  set up and how the writer side of it is handled, this will be a shell of a fictional organization without a good community of writers and readers behind it. <br><br>Things need to change. Whether it needs to be with actual rules and order, or a new board, or even both, I don&#39;t know, but  looking back and thinking to Ye Golden Days- any of ours- and complaining how it should return to that will not fix the problems.<br><br>July, now with 100% less bee guns, but still grumpy because this distracted her from finishing the survey up for this year, and now she is going to have to add even <i>more<i> questions to it and remove the starfish.</i></i></i></i></p>

            <p>We&#39;ve had this discussion before, but my position hasn&#39;t changed. I do not think a complete rehaul of a system that (for the overwhelming majority of the time) works just fine, is in order. Mainly, I don&#39;t think an influx of newbies is cause for panic. I would be slightly aghast at an influx of mods and admins, though, and I suspect that&#39;s still the majority view.<br><br>(On the other hand, I would not be opposed to a &#39;Board with software that allows us to have sections optional to view, or something.

            <p>Or perhaps simply not understanding it. As time goes on, I&#39;m more uncertain as to why admins should be such an anathema. Okay, we&#39;ve never had them before, but that isn&#39;t evidence that we don&#39;t need them now, or that they would be a bad thing. Why are rules bad? Why is it bad to have people whose role it is to enforce them?<br><br>Anarchy is great when everyone knows everyone else and they all get along most of the time. However, that isn&#39;t the case here and now. As July pointed out, most of us barely know the newest members, and there&#39;s hardly time to <i>get</i> to know them before the next crop turns up. With more complexity comes a need for more order to hold it together. Why is this additional order so disagreeable to contemplate?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>July said &quot;something has to change, whether it&#39;s the Board or the rules or whatever, because what we&#39;ve got right now isn&#39;t working.&quot; Dann and VM automatically went &quot;I disagree because admins are bad!&quot; which a) has nothing to do with July&#39;s argument and b) is not founded on evidence I&#39;m aware of.<br><br>My question is, why are admins automatically a terrible idea? You point out that we probably don&#39;t need them at this point, and that&#39;s fine, but it also doesn&#39;t address the question of why Dann and VM (and whoever else) hate the very idea of ever having them, <i>ever</i>, perhaps including hypothetical situations in which they&#39;d be useful.<br><br>To answer your question, an admin can make quick decisions, whereas group consensus takes time. Also, an admin is specifically obligated to resolve problems as they arise, whereas relying on the honor system can mean belated reactions or none at all if everyone goes about their business figuring someone else will do it.<br><br>Also, as Miah points out, those of us who do tend to step up more when situations arise may already be de facto admins.

            <p>Which is, I am aware, probably not the best excuse.

            <p>More authority bothers you because, from what I glean from your reply to July, you don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary right now, and also because we haven&#39;t had it before?<br><br>That still doesn&#39;t add up to a case for &quot;authority is inherently bad and we should never have it,&quot; though. Is it <i>bad</i> authority you&#39;re worried about? Or is it that you don&#39;t personally want to be it? Or... what?<br><br>We do already have authority figures, actually. The Permission Givers are authority figures, even if we only have power when it comes to granting Permission or not. Power and authority aren&#39;t the same thing—authority comes in part from knowing what you&#39;re talking about, doing things, and being respected for your words and actions. In my experience, PGs tend to get nominated because their authority in PPC matters is already acknowledged and accepted. As it goes, authority is a good and desirable quality in a PG—and heck, it&#39;s not like we have a monopoly on it. I personally think it would be awesome if more people stepped up and became authorities on the PPC, and comfortable with it, too, so they didn&#39;t feel like they had to say &quot;I&#39;m not a PG, but...&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m new, but...&quot; in front of everything. <i>That&#39;s</i> the way I remember it being—people stepping up to help each other, and not being afraid to be wrong, and able to gracefully accept correction if it were needed. (&quot;Oops, I was wrong. I&#39;ll do/know better next time—thanks!&quot; as opposed to &quot;OMG I&#39;m so sorry I&#39;ll never ever do it again pleasedon&#39;thurtme!&quot; What are people afraid is going to happen if they make mistakes and get corrected, I wonder? Also, the former&#39;s a lot more sincere and worthy of respect, IMO; the latter&#39;s practically self-defeating.)<br><br>Moving on... maybe we&#39;re not even talking about authority being bad, but rather power? Admins by definition have power, but then again, even if we did make some, they&#39;d only have whatever power and authority the group decided on for them. The Nameless Admin, for instance, has the power to delete threads and mess with the Board settings in general, but only has the authority to do so when asked, save in obvious cases of spam attack.<br><br>The PGs have little power, but lots of authority; the Nameless Admin has a lot of power, but little authority. Are you worried about creating something with lots of power <i>and</i> lots of authority?<br><br>... TL;DR, I&#39;m still struggling to understand exactly what you mean.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The current system as stands does not best serve the needs of the PPC community - as I see it, anyway. Both the guidelines of the organization itself and the Board need to be updated so as to better accommodate everyone, be they newbies or veterans.<br><br>I would very much be in favor of moving to a new board/forum; one with separate subsections, so that newbies could introduce themselves in one area and people could post missions in another, or something. There could be a section dedicated to things like the snowball/water fights or the goofiness of Fanficland - heck, there could even be something for extended play-by-post roleplaying.<br><br>Polishing up the Constitution is a nice start, but I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough. The PPC needs some adjustment if we want to thrive as a community.</p>

            <p>Speaking as a long-time proponent of this Board, I&#39;m currently feeling like the other side has a fairly strong argument if this one really isn&#39;t up to handling the large number of people it&#39;s been getting in recent years. It&#39;s not doing anyone any favors if the newbies literally can&#39;t integrate and the oldbies spend much of their time being frustrated with the newbies.<br><br>I personally don&#39;t like forums where everything is packed up in a separate box, because I worry that it will end up with certain people stuck in certain boxes so that they&#39;ll never have any contact with the people in the other boxes, but thinking about it lately, maybe there&#39;s some sort of compromise—a board with boxes that also has a prominent &quot;most recent&quot; feed, or similar?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In my opinion, one of the good things about the current PPC board is the <b>lack</b> of subforums or any other kind of compartmentalization because it lets everyone see most of the PPC&#39;s going-ons just by scrolling down. It also, like others have said, prevents community fragmentation. I posted to note that this &quot;one Board&quot; arrangement is more like the mailing lists created with software such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html">Mailman</a> than the typical internet forum. I spoke up to show support for the current way of organizing threads.<br><br>Since I&#39;m already rambling about this, what do you all think about moving to a mailing list?</p>

            <p>I think we can fix that problem without changing the entire base of the &#39;Board. It is, in point of fact, a forum, though a strange and outdated one. I, and I think most people, would not be a fan of changing that - among other things, that seems much harder to organize and keep track of. If someone wanted to start a mailing list, some people might be interested, but I think most of the community would find it a difficult change, and it would be rather difficult for newbies to get into.<br><br>Just my opinion, but I think we&#39;re better off organizing without changing the nature of the &#39;Board that drastically.</p>

            <p>Okay. Before I being in earnest, let me apologize in advance if any part of the following post seems overly confrontational or aggressive. My intention isn&#39;t to pick a fight; I just want to air my reaction to some of the things in your post.<br><br>Regarding posts: I believe that there are still circumstances that require the guidelines regarding new threads. The Board may not move as fast as it did in the past, but you have to realize that many people are not checking the Board every day, or possibly even every few days. If someone in their well-intentioned naivetй puts up a great deal of new threads, those PPCers who swing by on an irregular basis might miss something. New missions or announcements can get knocked down the page by repetitive or redundant threads - out of sight, out of mind.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to think that we&#39;re not &quot;telling people off.&quot; We&#39;re not insulting or haranguing people who create a lot of new threads; we&#39;re just giving them a little nudge, is all.<br><br>Finally, what really got me steamed was the little comment about you &quot;still having some hope for the PPC despite the fact that [your] wife says it&#39;s useless.&quot; This addition is uncalled for, unnecessary, and a little insulting. Framing it as being someone else&#39;s opinion doesn&#39;t help. By saying that you still &quot;have hope,&quot; you portray the PPC as something in decline, a group that has fallen out of a Golden Age. The statement suggests that those in the PPC now don&#39;t compare to those writers who have already come and gone. Criticize if you must, but don&#39;t wound us with backhanded praise.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>I would also like to point out that the IRC channel exists. You (hS, not PC) may have voiced your dislike of it several times in the past, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that not only does it exist, it is the most active hub for the PPC, and that several people, myself included, have mentioned that they prefer the IRC to the board <i>because</i> it&#39;s more active.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve expressed dislike of the IRC before, true - but only (I hope) on a personal level. <i>I</i> don&#39;t like it, but that doesn&#39;t mean other people can&#39;t. So I&#39;m very glad it&#39;s active. And I wasn&#39;t complaining about the inactivity of the Board - just pointing out that times change. Part of that is because the action has moved to the IRC - and that&#39;s okay.<br><br>And yes, if people post multiple threads in a row, that would be worth mentioning. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. What&#39;s happening is that people are making a thread for a badfic or goodfic when there is another thread on a similar topic somewhere down the board - in one case, a full eight posts below (that is, halfway down). And yes, they <i>are</i> being told off - the two posts on the front page have subject lines &#39;Chill out&#39; and &#39;Should have read&#39;.<br><br>As to my signoff - it actually <i>is</i> my wife&#39;s opinion, she keeps telling me to give up, and since she&#39;s been a member of the PPC longer than literally anyone else currently on the Board, she might know what she&#39;s talking about. ;) But it&#39;s not about the writing, and it&#39;s not about the new people. It&#39;s specifically about this ongoing tendency towards the authoritarian - rules, regulations, etc.<br><br>But I have hope. Yes, I <i>do</i>. A few years back every story written seemed to be trying to be bigger and more disastrous than the last - there&#39;s even a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Catastrophe_Theory">Theory</a> about it. That was a trend which ended, largely because we as a community said it should.<br><br>And that&#39;s the heart of this. The PPC is a community first and foremost - a community of equals. People being reprimanded for posting In The Wrong Way is <i>not</i> the action of equals - it&#39;s a way of saying Obey, For I Have Been Here Longer. And I don&#39;t like that.<br><br>Even though I&#39;m kind of implicitly doing it. ;) But I hope I&#39;m not. What I&#39;m trying to do - what I hope I&#39;m vaguely succeeding at - is say that we don&#39;t need rules for the sake of rules. This is still the PPC - the glorious, anarchistic PPC of the past ten years. <i>I</i> don&#39;t think we&#39;ve changed that much. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &#39;Golden Age&#39; that&#39;s passed - maybe for the stories (since Jay and Acacia aren&#39;t still here), but not for the community.<br><br>So I applaud the IRC&#39;s activity even as I detest it, and I say we don&#39;t need to tell each other off - even as I sort of do it - because I&#39;ve seen what the PPC is, and I want it to stay that way.<br><br>hS, who jelly caterpillar squib</p>

            <p>Part of what we&#39;re asking people to do when we ask them not to make redundant threads is to read what&#39;s already present before saying something.

            <p>Although I&#39;d agree that the PPC has changed, change happens, the IRC is important, constant Badfic!threads are eh, and so on and so forth, I think you&#39;re seriously onto something there.<br><br>I really miss the long, silly conversations that were occasionally not much more than two people being silly at each other. Although the issues with thread-explosions are there, I am entirely of the opinion that we&#39;ve swung too far in the other direction. I can see a &quot;Hey, there&#39;s a badfic thread down there, let&#39;s try and keep things organized?&quot; thread. But these days, newbies don&#39;t even get that. They get smacked down for not knowing every single rule that everyone in the PPC has agreed on, despite possibly never having been here before - I see this <i>constantly</i>. People pop up without reading the Wiki to say hi, and on their second thread ever, three people jump down their throat for not having taken notes on the FAQ. This site used to be welcoming and friendly; nowadays, if you prefer friendly conversation over wombats and towels, you&#39;re in the wrong place.<br><br>I wince every time I see someone&#39;s thread get shut down, because it means one more person who&#39;s going to be discouraged from posting again. If people responded this way back when I started posting here, I most likely wouldn&#39;t have stayed - and trust me, my initial posts were a lot more annoying than the stuff that gets put up now.<br><br>In short, I think the truth is somewhere in between. Change is good, yes, but some things - like being <i>friendly</i> about rules, not authoritarian - really... shouldn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>For me, I was trying to explain what a Mary Sue was to my friend that I was attempting to co-write with.

            <p>I agree with HuineSoron and VixenMage. I&#39;m still relatively new, and I still remember my first few months.

Sure, it makes things sink to the bottom of the board, but if it&#39;s a mission then it should be going onto the front page of the wiki anyways.<br><br>Perhaps gentle reminders to look at the wiki before asking questions would work more than just yelling. Maybe a warning system should be put into place?<br><br>Also, when there&#39;s a badfic thread already on the front page, but not towards the top, it has less of a chance of getting seen. That might be why new threads keep popping up; because either A. The person hasn&#39;t seen the previous thread, or B. Because they think that no one else will see the old thread.<br><br>Maybe if there were a way so that threads that get new posts get moved up to the top?</p>

            <p>... but I&#39;ll do so again, since I was clearly pretty, er, unclear (in that my clarity was not clear... is this Repetitive Department of Repetition material, do we think?):<br><br>I wasn&#39;t complaining about AnnaBee and Himochi&#39;s conversations; quite the opposite. But my point was that it was just two people, and thus wouldn&#39;t be a loss to the community if it left the front page, since they can easily continue it on page 2. Something like <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/Snowfight2005Part1.htm">The Snowfight</a>, on the other hand, or any of the debates we&#39;ve had, would be something that had to stay on the front page.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have a crazy idea. It&#39;s a rule. It&#39;s not a real rule that imposes penalties or things like that, so perhaps, its more of a suggestion. So, I guess I&#39;m suggesting a suggestion.<br><br>Perhaps badfic threads should be encouraged to have some kind of uniform title. Seriously, titles like &quot;AHH!!! MY EYES!&quot; or &quot;The author would be sad&quot; are not terribly amusing or interesting, and they make it harder to quickly spot a badfic thread. I blame this for much of the redundant posting, though that might not be the case.<br><br>So my suggestion: Encourage future badfic threads to clearly say, in their title, that they are a badfic reporting thread. They can keep the silly titles, since saying that they can&#39;t is really against the spirit of the PPC, but ending with something like &quot;(Badfic reporting thread)&quot; would help make things clearer. At least, I think so. </p>

Neshomeh and Araeph started discussing semantics on the last one, which is awesome - and should be on the Board so anyone can join in. So my theory (that the threads consist entirely of &#39;Link! Linklink! Goodness that&#39;s terrible! Linklinklink!&#39;) was wrong, and so was the suggestion I never made.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m looking for someone to help out checking the piece I intend to submit as my writing sample, when I make my permission request. <br><br>The piece is a fanfic for Calvin and Hobbes (picked on the basis that it matched the PPC for randomness potential). I&#39;ve had a quick look at the List of Betas over on the wiki, but couldn&#39;t see anyone specifically saying they knew the continuum, so I thought I&#39;d ask around here.<br><br>I don&#39;t have anywhere yet to put it up online, but I&#39;ve got it as a Word document so I can e-mail it out, or maybe just copy the text into a post?

            <p>It&#39;s one of those ones that is great to go back to and reread all the time (in my opinion).

            <p>Many of us put our unfinished (ie unbeta&#39;d) missions up on Google Docs, because it&#39;s free and you can control exactly who can see and edit and make comments. All it takes is signing up for an account, and has all the tools you need for beta reading. <br><br>Also, a it is sometimes beneficial to have a beta who specifically doesn&#39;t know the continuum, so they can point out the in-jokes that you understand but that other people might not so that you can clarify them, which is especially helpful if you work in a small continuum (like, say, I&#39;m currently working on a mission in the Brother Cadfael continuum, which at last count only one other person in the PPC knew about).<br><br>/my two cents. </p>

            <p>I like the fact that not only were they Sues, they had horribly incompetent opponents. If they were agents on a mission, they would at least have some way to wipe minds. Yet they just sit there, being scared of the Sues. The magic-elf/Human Torch/earthbender/Poison Ivy who had a legendary Pokйmon as one of her first 3, and everyone who hates her dies horribly. Overkill-Sue much?<br>Anyway, I laughed so hard at this. Thanks for the laughs!<br>Ivan</p>

            <p>It&#39;s good to see that he bothered to do some research before forming this opinion, oh wait, no, he didn&#39;t &#39;I have no idea what “The Hunger Games” is like... I don’t know because it’s a book for kids.&#39;<br><br>I wonder how he knows it&#39;s a book for kids if he&#39;s never read it? Personally I think it does have the depth of characterisation that he so blithely assumes it couldn&#39;t possess; Peeta&#39;s line of &#39;wanting to die while I&#39;m still me, and not be changed by them&#39; (I forget the exact quote, and can&#39;t find my copy of the book) is proof enough of that. <br><br>That article is the most infuriating thing I&#39;ve read in quite some time.</p>

            <p>I love how much of a child Stein comes off as in this article. Have you ever met a kid who determinedly only did thing that were considered &#39;adult&#39; without any true understanding of the word? The article reminds me of this more than anything.<br>Also, I love that he seems to imply that all &#39;adult&#39; literature contains heavy and great ideals just by virtue of their target age range. Sturgeon&#39;s law applies across the board, and there is just as much schlock for adults as there is for kids.<br>Besides, &#39;children&#39;s&#39; books come with an awesome community.<br>I will never give up young adult literature. And I will be less ignorant that Mr. Stein for it.</p>

            <p>The Brony knows this feel. As much as I&#39;ve grown to detest Narnia over the years, I love C.S. Lewis for that one quote, because he&#39;s damn right! I may be an Atheist, but God bless him.<br><br> You know, it&#39;s funny. These people call us childish, and yet- wait a second!- they&#39;re the ones making judgments about us based on our passtimes. To me, maturity isn&#39;t a matter of your interests. It&#39;s a matter of discretion, responsibility, and behavior. A mature person, for instance, may watch MLP. So can an immature person. The mature person understands why clopfiction is good sporking material and bad dinner conversation, whereas the immature person does not. It&#39;s all about being able to behave appropriately for the role you&#39;re in and the setting. For instance, being a mature person, I do not bring up fart jokes when I am speaking to a classroom full of students, when I&#39;m their instructor, but I do bring them up while I&#39;m on break with them, enjoying some bonding time and a slice of pizza, when I&#39;m their friend.<br><br> Like I said, it&#39;s all about whether or not the actions/conversation/whatever is appropriate for the role you&#39;re fulfilling and the setting you&#39;re in.</p>

            <p>I have such a love-hate relationship with him. On the one hand, <i>Narnia</i>. The first real story I read on my own, for fun*. The author who changed my theological leanings forever with <i>The Great Divorce</i>, though perhaps not the way he would&#39;ve intended. The man whose blindingly infuriating misogyny in The Space Trilogy have somehow not obscured his heartrending humility, grief, and honesty in <i>Til We Have Faces</i> and <i>A Grief Observed</i>. The man who came up with the Trilemma, which has frustrated so many fundamentalists, atheists, and people who routinely shout things like &quot;<i>That&#39;s not how insanity <u>works</u>!</i>&quot; whenever it&#39;s brought up...<br><br>Yeah, like I said, love-hate to the extreme.<br><br>But ye gods, he had some <i>brilliant</i> insights on human nature and literature and fiction.<br><br>*except possibly <i>White Fang</i></p>

            <p>Makes me think of this quote: <br>“Critics who treat ‘adult’ as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”<br><br>― C.S. Lewis</p>

            <p>From what I can hear- and read- it&#39;s the My Immortal of Death Note. With NEARLY as much as unintentional hilarity.<br><br>In the first three chapters: <br><br>1. A town called &quot;Whales&quot; in England. The agents will need to go in there, rescue the whales, and burn it to the ground.<br><br>2. L randomly transforming into &#39;pies of sh@t&#39; for no reason. <br><br>3. A Stu Death Note that can kill anyone you write their name in... even if you don&#39;t know their name or have their face. Thus simultaneously trampling on canon and perplexing my agents.<br><br>&quot;How can you kill someone by writing their name down if you don&#39;t know their name?&quot;<br><br><br>4. This charming little exchange... <br>&quot;&quot;Ok. I won&#39;t tell L on one condition you have to sex with me.&quot;<br><br>Vernet, being literal-minded: &quot;Sex *what* with me? Chickens? Cats? Shinigami?&quot; <br>~<br><br>&quot;I am vicarious&quot; Misa replied...<br><br>Mundar: ...Dunno what that means, but I don&#39;t think it means what she thinks it means.<br><br>5. More on the serious end... inSANE amounts of OOC, including Light killing for fun. Meaning: Kill Dark Yagami. Kill Sayu-Sue. Possibly with their own Evil Death Note of Evil.<br><br>6. A LOT of in-text author&#39;s notes. Thanks to the Ironic Overpower, either Mundar or Vernet forgot their music of choice. And naturally, neither can stand the other&#39;s taste. <br><br>7. Blood bananas. Which are exactly what it says on the tin. Bananas... made of blood. That shinigami eat。<br>The deuce?<br><br>8. &quot;&quot;Stop saying colour! Your in America now! Its color!&quot; Light replied exaspirated.<br><br>&quot;Sorry lol&quot; Dark said.&quot;<br><br>... ... ... ... <br><br>9. &quot;Dark took his cellphone out of his special place (AN: figure it out for yourself lol!)&quot;<br><br>Mundar: Easy, it&#39;s up his a-<br>Vernet: This is a T-rated fic, Mr. Fivehills.<br>Mundar: I can still say arse, can&#39;t I? <br>Vernet: ...Seeing as you just did... <br><br><br>10. High amounts of such total Whiskey Tango Foxtrot as to keep an entire ARMY of agents occupied for months. <br><br><br>*looks at you* Hey, you&#39;ve got tickets to that thing I love!<br><br>And yes... I think I can make it funny. I don&#39;t know if I could make it funny to ANYONE else, but I&#39;d have fun sporking it.</p>

            <p>I answered primarily on a &#39;right now or in recent memory&#39; basis. For instance, I used to read at least three books a week, sometimes more than one in a day, and for all I know I could decide to pick up that habit again tomorrow. Or perhaps I&#39;ll decide to finish one of my fanfics and get it beta&#39;d.

            <p>It depends on what, honestly. Colleges tend to either be vocational/technical schools or &#39;associate&#39;s degree&#39;.

            <p>Well, if you want to go into linguistic differences, then you have to keep in mind that it&#39;s been two thousand years, with Germanic mercenaries as well as the Romans.

            <p>I don&#39;t know any Latin, but I DO know the <i>Codex Alera</i>, and yes, it&#39;s very off. For one thing, surnames and titles go first on all the Aleran names we see in the series; Desiderius&#39;s name is right there on the last page as, &quot;Gaius Desiderius Tavarus.&quot; And you&#39;re right, the Marat don&#39;t use surnames: the Sabot-ha are the <i>Gargant Clan</i>, which Kitai, obviously, isn&#39;t a member of. Same for Tavi&#39;s name; the quote from him at the beginning of the epilogue is attributed to Gaius Tavarus Magnus. I suspect &quot;Octavian&quot; would still be used sometimes, but given that Desiderius is Tavi&#39;s son, he&#39;d probably be using the one Tavi preferred, which evidence suggests is probably Tavarus. (I mean, he broke an eight-generation naming tradition to name his son that and, again, signed that quote as Tavarus.)<br><br>I also can&#39;t see Kitai calling herself &quot;Gaius,&quot; but that&#39;s more of a characterization thing.<br><br>In the fic&#39;s defense, though, an air crocodile isn&#39;t much weirder than Attis&#39;s air <i>shark</i>.<br><br>(Also, I vote mini-vordknights or -vordbulks. ;) )<br><br>[/long rant]</p>

            <p>Actually, near as I can tell, Tavi broke a thousand-year tradition with sliding over to Tavarus, which <em>is</em> how history remembers him; there&#39;s a mention somewhere of &quot;the first Gaius Primus,&quot; implying there&#39;s been more than one. My own theory is that whenever there&#39;d be civil war, due to Alera&#39;s existence when the Crown did pass to a new branch of the family, the numbering reset. The last set of eight was just the very last of the family, because apparently they stopped having affairs or something. There&#39;s also half a dozen reasons for Tavi to slam his hand down on switching to Tavarus--not least among them a message to the Canim, who are frankly only nominally independent at this point. But yes, so many charges for the names.<br><br>Whether or not she&#39;s ever Gaius Kitai is a curious question for the future.<br><br>Anyway, all of this is true, and the author actually gets the technicalities of furycrafting wrong, and there are half a dozen other issues. My biggest gripe with the fic is quite different, though, and you can wait until the mission itself to see it. It will be made quite <em>abundantly</em> clear.<br><br>I don&#39;t think it should be the knights or bulks; the wax spiders are so much more iconic. Also, so much creepier. As the first to dare this territory, I Hereby Designate!<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure that while Octavian Magnus probably counts because just no, and while it&#39;s all technically just wrong, the mistakes may not actually be <em>mini</em> worthy. <br>It&#39;s intentional, to try to create the AU.

            <p>I kept looking it up, and consistently found two words for honor: veneratio and, well, honor. With that, it&#39;s pretty clear one is a matter of personal code and the other, well, veneration, which is very clearly not the context.<br><br>Declension... yeah, I thought about that. Thing is, the words don&#39;t exist in a void with the statement. I seriously considered tossing the &#39;pro&#39; in at the beginning, to punctuate it. Hypothetically nominative is right, but it just isn&#39;t a cool list of things. I dropped the &#39;pro&#39; because it kept changing both ultio(ne/vindicta) to either &quot;the revenge&quot; or &quot;the vengeance of&quot; when I checked the translation against Google (trying to learn Latin grammar on the fly sucks okay). Neither connotation was what I wanted in context, so I went with ablative to preserve that spirit of the implied &#39;pro&#39; of the intended English.<br><br>I&#39;ll probably mention both declensions, though, in the comment. Context is, by the way, that the badfic author wrote, &quot;veneratio, licentia, quod ultionis.&quot;</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve found a few descriptions for them;<br>The wiki page for mini-Boarders says they have &#39;a variety of apperances&#39; (not vastly helpful in narrowing down what they typically look like, I know). <br>The wiki page for Minis says that mini-Boarders &#39;are usually small versions of the Boarder whose name was misspelled&#39;<br>And finally number 186 of the list of Things I am not Allowed to Do at the PPC (well worth a read) says that mini-Boarders have &#39;sharp hooves and long, silky hair&#39;<br><br>Hope that helps. </p>

            <p>I recently decided to go back and re-read a monster of a fanfic that I fell in love with a few years back, and it got me wondering. Has anyone else enjoyed a fanfic enough to go back and re-read it? And if so, what was it and why?<br><br><br>For me it was a Teen Titans fanfic called These Black Eyes and was huge in size and scale. The main character was bordering on Gary-Stuism but the plot and character interactions more than made up for it in my eyes.</p>

            <p>Yet Again with a Little Extra Help (Naruto continuum). This was back when I thought Naruto was the bomb, but it&#39;s still pretty good even when I&#39;ve lost most of my interest in the series. The characters are pretty Stu-ish, but I occasionally really enjoy reading about someone coming in and fixing all the crap Kishimoto inflicted upon us poor fans. <br>Also, it is funny, and funny is good.</p>

            <p>Discovering a new fandom for me is always like discovering a stash of food I&#39;d forgotten about during paper-writing season. I tend to go back to a few perennial favorites now and again, either because I&#39;m bored or can&#39;t find anything new and good, or occasionally because there was an image I couldn&#39;t get out of my head.<br><br>Most forefront are the mass of crossover/fusions by Vathara -- they put so much thought and work into the blending, it&#39;s amazing and unreal. My favorite of those is probably Upon a Fiery Steed, which is a Gundam Wing and Stargate: SG-1 fusion. <br><br>I find I enjoy it even more than I did at first now that I&#39;ve actually watched Gundam Wing properly. :P</p>

            <p>Yes, my favorite fics I always come back to. There is a really good FF7 one called Green Dreams that I like to reread. Of course, that and most of my other return fics are still being updated, so. . . <br><br>On the other hand, have you ever come back to a fic and found it lacking? For example, there was this fic called <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3540868/1/The_Power_of_Magic_and_Elves">The Power of Magic and Elves</a> that I read when I was really new to being a reader. I lost it for many years, and built it up in my mind as TEH BEST THING EVAR, even as my tastes refined and my writing got better. When I found this thing again, it literally hurt me. I guess my memories of it just proves that I had awful taste back when I was twelve. Anyone else had this happen to them?<br><br>(This thing is prime material for sporking, by the way, so if anyone works in crossovers. . .)</p>

            <p>The Subject line is one of my favorite, because it sums the whole thing up.  Pretty much the entire thing is a great quote, though. Especially on the Youtube videos.

            <p>&quot;My Inner Life.&quot; That is all. There&#39;s a good 2-3 pages of author&#39;s notes at the beginning of the fic ranting about how awful the reviewers are for flaming her.

            <p>Ah, yes. We need a Madoka OFU just for that one writer, I swear. And no, it also has Sayaka replaced, Kyouko replaced, and FREAKING ULTIMATE MADOKA replaced.<br><br>The singular upside to this: In another fanfiction, she has Homulilly (witch-form Homura) cause the end of the world, and replaces Kyubey. Seriously, listen to this: <br><br>Kyubey jumped on Madoka&#39;s shoulder and said: &quot;Be careful Madoka, I don&#39;t want you to die until you&#39;ve become a Puella Magi and until you&#39;ve become a witch.&quot;<br><br>Yeah, screw subtletly. It makes a) Homura become a sort-of intelligent witch, with a human body and sane mind (because the writer thought that &quot;her witche&#39;s design is not cool/pretty enough for her.&quot; (quoting) Yes, why SHOULDN&quot;T a monster spawned from despair look pretty? The fanfic also makes Homura&#39;s timeloops be a coma-dream. Uh, yeah. Clearly she missed the part about magic breaking reality (also, Homura apparently sleeps with her glasses on.)<br><br>In spite of this, Homulilly actually manages to be a good character. She&#39;s a replacement, and does pull off one or two improbable magic stunts, but she has a tolerable personality, and seems like prime recruitment material. I plan to recruit her later and write her. Ah, such plans I have....</p>

            <p>The only other example of total replacement I&#39;ve seen in a non-Legendary badfic is in the Ace Combat one that I took down some months ago.<br><br>My Agents had to bomb down the whole place (uncanonical air base), partially because they couldn&#39;t kill the replacements one by one as they were an indistict mass around Not!Harry Potter.<br><br>Good luck with that one.

            <p>There is no freaking way a shotgun can be silenced!<br><br>A silencer is an empty pipe with baffles in it.

            <p>Does the board have a scale of manipulative villain-ness? If not, I suggest milli-Tzeentchs. So where would Tigerstar be? I think 700ish, considering he sparked a war when he was dead, as well as at least two while alive. Plus the few that nearly started, plus almost taking over the Clans, if he had not missed one witness to a murder.</p>

            <p>He&#39;s not just an antihero, I think he&#39;s also an antivillain (e.g. the evil dictator) and, well, it&#39;s complicated. I don&#39;t think anybody on the Disc is really sure who&#39;s side he&#39;s on.<br>Actually, he&#39;s on Ankh-Morpork&#39;s side. He does stuff, no matter how much it is considered wrong by others, for the city. And he runs the city very well, and has no adjective behind his name. However, this does not say much else about who&#39;s side he&#39;s on.<br>Also, Vetinari is Vimes&#39;s age, that is to say late forties to early fifties. I deducted this from Night watch, where it states that Sam is 16 while Vetinari is a teenager. But Vetinari&#39;s age is besides the point.<br></p>

            <p>If there is no OFU, whoever writes the first mission in a given continuum gets to decide the mini.  I don&#39;t believe there has been a Death Note mission, as of yet.  So, whoever gets there first gets to choose.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Since the previous request made by my partner-in-sporking went with nearly no answers (and I don&#39;t know if the only one who aswered has access to the mission, as I don&#39;t see activity on the Gdoc file. If you don&#39;t, give here your e-mail (disguised enough to fool bots), I&#39;ll send you the link), I&#39;m re-requesting, adding also another mission of mine that needs betaing.<br><br>So... There we are (for both we need mainly PPC/SPaG/Mission plot checking, as we should have the canon covered right):<br><br>1) Legenday Illogic - Harry Potter &amp; Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha<br>Collaboration between me and Firemagic. Don&#39;t be scared if you don&#39;t know anything about Nanoha, both of us are well knowledgeable in it so we should have it covered. Being long, we want to be sure we didn&#39;t miss anything.<br><br>(Warning: There&#39;s still an incomplete description, because we have a doubt about it. It is highlighted in red.)<br><br>2) A Very Awkward Exorcism - Card Captor Sakura<br>A pretty textbook illogical hurt/comfort. I already sent out beta-requests by e-mail, but since I never received a response there was probably something wrong with my Hotmail account (from now on, I&#39;m going to use the Gmail one for PPC stuff). Firemagic already went through it, but I prefer to have multiple betas if possible.<br><br>Note: A Very Awkward Exorcism is set at least six months before Legendary Illogic, and I will probably write more mission in between in the future, so if things don&#39;t go smoothly from one another don&#39;t be puzzled. *tries to keep together his Agent&#39;s timeline with duct tape*<br><br>Anyone interested, please write contact means and betaing choice. Thank you!</p>

            <p>&quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Australian_Indoor-Rules_Quiddich">Australian Indoor-Rules Quiddich</a> is played with a dark hallway and a hard rubber ball. The best kind is a rubber ball with a solid core and an LED in the center that lights up on impact. Sometimes they give them away at trade shows or conventions as a promotional freebie. The hallway should be as close to pitch-black as you can get it. Throw the ball at each other as hard as you can. That’s it. You are free to defend yourself in any way that doesn’t make you look like a cringing wuss. Use of bats is not encouraged, but they can be used for defense as a house rule. No score is kept and there is no clear way to win. Play continues until you stop.&quot;<br><br><br>Anyone interested in trying to set up the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/All-HQ_Australian_Indoor-Rules_Quiddich_League">All-HQ Australian Indoor-Rules Quiddich League</a> again?<br><br>For those curious about this, a few years back Trojie and I started AHAIRQL, with two teams. There were three matches.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Q9zdeaWW0p8xrz1GUHRmU33uLG-lPG5gNKjR5t1Fj9E"> First game.</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=16LB_bh57RCCg7i0-APZESAzCCODfZK5QGuGol1k8-DI">Second game.</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1onjT9pVPvKAj23IhpjbthtUQ9QavqdcIeMFOPwj9QdI">Final match.</a><br><br>There was an intent to run a second season, but that never came to fruition. So with that in mind, and the fact that people keep asking for it every now and then, here&#39;s a second attempt!<br><br><br>This post is basically to gauge interest, set down guidelines, and when the first set of stories will be due.<br><br>How it will run this time is that after teams are made up- which you will be doing in this thread- you will have until the end of the 23rd to write a recruitment story for that team. If a team&#39;s players are all written by one person, that single person is in charge of writing said recruitment story and all matches. If a team&#39;s players are written by several people, they may cowrite or choose one amongst them to write the recruitment story, and must assign an individual writer for later matches (either for the whole season or on a by match basis).<br><br>Regardless of who writes it, all recruitment stories must be ready for posting by the 23rd. <br><br>After this point of time, a league table (or something) will be drawn up, in which the matches will be organized. <br><br>Matches will be cowritten by the opposing team writers, with the winner to be determined by a coin toss (unless the person who calls the winning coin wants to give the win to the other team.) The coin toss will be kept secret, which only the writers will know until the match is finished.<br><br>These matches will be considered canonical- in so much as anything is- which is the reason why match writers must have permission. Agents taking part should already be accepted through their writer having permission or by having been brought up in a PPC story, so as to prevent any unexpected disappearances happening in a cloud of concrit (in other words: to not have any agents that are pending permission end up with the writer being explicitly denied those agents during a permission request).<br><br><br>To clarify and modify on the rules:<br><br><font size="3"><b>Players</b></font><br><br><ul>
<br><li>Players cannot substitute other equipment in during matches; they must use their AHAIRQL regulation bat. A regulation bat is wooden, and may or may not have a foam surface to help against causing worse injuries. Splintered, cracked, or otherwise damaged bats may not be used in new matches.</li>  <br><li>Players cannot use powers during game play.</li> <br><li>Agents that have abilities that cannot be ignored or otherwise not used- such as seeing naturally in the dark, or are potentially fatally strong and have no control over such- cannot play, to limit unfair advantages and unintentional death. This is supposed to be fun, not murderous. </li>
<br>
</ul>
<br><font size="3"><b>Teams</b></font><br><br><ul>
<br><li>Teams may be inter-departmental or departmental based.</li>
<br><li>Teams are limited to having <b>six agents on them at the most</b>.</li>
<br><li>Teams will field an equal number of players; if a team has a lower number of players than the other team, the second team may only put enough players into play to watch the first team.</li>
<br><li>Teams cannot put substitutes into play after a match has already begun. Substituting in players after a match has started will result in an automatic forfeit of said match after the substitution has been discovered.</li>
<br><br>
</ul>
<br><font size="3"><b>Gameplay</b></font><br><br><ul>
<br><li>In an unlit corridor, hit a light up ball around.</li>
<br><li>There are no points for keeping score.</li>
<br><li>Gameplay continues until one team cannot continue any longer.</li>
<br><li>The less battered team wins.</li>
<br>

            <p>Haha, sorry for stereotyping!

Okay. You can be on our team... if you can best one of these other people right here, right now. You got what it takes? Do ya?!<br><br>Unger: Yeah! I totally do! Bring it!<br><br>Suicide: *cracks knuckles, grins, is scary-looking*<br><br>[I have no idea how Saline, Gremlin, or Noir would react.]<br><br>Derik: NO, we are not going to start a bar brawl over a stupid sport!

            <p>&#39;Cause organization is good.<br><br>I&#39;m up for writing, though I&#39;m also going to do a FicPsych team (which I should post the roster for), so if that team ever goes up against this team, someone else should probably help handle this one. Also, taking turns would be cool, if other people want to write.<br><br>For this first thing, though, I&#39;d like to collaborate with all of you, maybe by means of e-mail and/or a Gdoc. Obviously I can write my own characters, and I&#39;ve worked with Tungsten a fair bit before, but I&#39;m not as familiar with the rest of you and your characters, so I&#39;m not comfortable guessing how it will go with them. The actual games aren&#39;t terribly reliant on character, I&#39;m not worried about that, but how everybody gets together should probably make sense characterization-wise.<br><br>Yes? No? Also, team name suggestions?<br><br>For the record, combining what I already know with gleanings from the wiki, this is a breakdown of the team:<br><br>- Derik (Co-captain, strategist, in the habit of people listening to him)<br>- Gall (Co-captain, recruiter/loudmouth, muscle, not in the habit of listening to anyone)<br>- Suicide (big muscle, crazy mofo)<br>- Saline (techie/necromancer)<br>- Gremlin (former gang member, technomancer)<br>- Noir (former hit man)<br><br>And also Unger, team mascot/alternate/challenger for your position if it turns out he&#39;s tougher than you despite his less than imposing appearance, because <s>Neshomeh has a big mouth</s> Gall doesn&#39;t respect anyone who isn&#39;t prepared to talk with their fists.<br><br>...

            <p>I&#39;m not certain, but I don&#39;t think that there has been a Soul Eater mission before (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong). Is there any specific protocol for writing the first mission in a continuum? I&#39;ve poked around the Wiki and can&#39;t really find anything, so if I missed something, links would be nice! <br>I am correct in saying that the first writer to do a mission in a continuum gets to choose the mini for that continuum, right?</p>

            <p>Nope, no protocol for the first mission in a continuum. In most cases, it&#39;s not that big a deal, unless it&#39;s a continuum that just got de-quarantined or something like that, as in the case of the first Pern mission.<br><br>And yeah, if there isn&#39;t an OFU, the first person to write about minis in a given continuum gets to decide what they are. Presumably, the mini should be something an OFU could use to keep fanbrats in check and prevent stampeding, so slightly terrifying is good. Usually it&#39;s some sort of monster that&#39;s unique to the &#39;verse, though not usually a unique named character, though exceptions exist on all counts.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I understand how the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Designated_Arbitrator">designated arbitrator</a> system works in the IRC. I am confused, however, as to why certain individuals have full mod power, when they were not voted to be DAs. I was under the impression that the DA system was in place so that our kind-of authority figures were elected. At my count, we currently have three individuals with automatic full mod powers who are not DAs. I would appreciate an explanation. </p>

            <p>I need to apologize, for many, many things. It’s amazing how quickly you will realize how much of a horrible person you have been when your anger goes away, and you realize that you had nothing to be righteously angry about in the first place.<br><br>I apologize for my conduct. Knee jerk reaction anger is not a sound basis for an argument. <br><br>I apologize to those who I may have leveled accusations against. Any accusations of wrongdoing in the case of mod selection are unfounded.<br><br>I apologize for anyone I may have intentionally or unintentionally dragged into this. That was wrong of me, and I’m incredibly sorry.<br><br>Feelings I had prior to Nakkel’s selection as a mod certainly played a part in my reaction. A huge, enormous part. I will admit that publicly here.I did not, and I need to make this clear, INTEND TO USE Tray’s case to settle a grudge with July. Rather, it caused feelings of anger I already had towards her to crystallize. (See below for exactly what that meant.) That is why I was perfectly willing, in my opening post, to try to do this without bringing him up. So yes. His departure made me angry at July, which was backed by feelings of annoyance and frustration I already had for her. (A grudge, for lack of a better term.) Tray only got brought up AFTER Data mentioned him. At that point, I wanted to try to explain my actions, which were already looking stupid. So I told everyone a half-truth: Tray’s departure angered me, and I was fighting it. As mentioned, strictly speaking, this is true. I was deluding myself thinking that I could convince anyone that I had no grudge with July, and that things were only happening because of this one case. In this sense, I did use him; as a way to keep from accepting responsibility for my own actions. That is despicable. I cannot say how sorry I am that I used him; even if it was unintentional, and I did not realize it until I sat down to write this apology. <br><br>In my anger I oversimplified things to fit my own vision. I felt like Tray leaving was the last straw; the last thing in what suddenly appeared to be a succession of events leading up to this moment. I felt that things needed to change. (See what Data alluded to me saying in conversations in his post.) And so I made a post, in anger, that attacked an individual who did not deserve the accusations I made in it. I continued to defend this post long after it was obvious that I was wrong, even to myself. Anger drove me, I have no other explanation. I thought I could right some long lasting wrong with this one thing. There was no way I could bring up my real reason for my anger; since that would break confidentiality. (Not that my reasons were right. I just thought they were.) Obviously, admitting I had a personal grudge against July on top of what I saw as my reasons would destroy my case, so I had to keep that in check. The issue of mod selection seemed like one that I could argue for, and that I had a logical basis for my argument. I could use it (that word again) to right these terrible wrongs. Is it obvious that I was trying to settle a score now? Yes. Did I realize I was trying to settle a score? No, of course not. I thought I was a defender of those who had been injured, but refused to speak up, and voicing concerns everyone else had. Obviously, I thought my anger was justified, and that I could, at least on this one issue, get people to my side. That was not the case, and for that, there is good reason. I was wrong. I was completely wrong. <br><br>As to conversations alluded to by Data: The one with Phobos was quite genuine; as stated above, I believed things that are not necessarily true. I was hoping to get him on my side, but I was not trying to manipulate him, by explaining what I believed to be true.<br><br>The things I told Data, I told him because I wanted him to understand. I did not think I could bring him to my side; but I very badly wanted him to understand.<br><br>As for EF, what I talked with her about was very similar to what I said to Phobos. Both of these conversations were almost pure expressions of my truest thoughts and feelings on the subject; what I posted on the board, especially at first, were what I thought were my unrelated arguments on this one issue I could use to end the issues I was talking about with Phobos and EF. I thought that surely, they agreed with me, and I could convince them to actively help me on the board.<br><br>To all three of you, I apologize. It was not my intention to manipulate you. I genuinely believed what I was saying. It would be much more true to say that I was telling you what I believed, and trying to restrict what I said on the board in order to both keep from breaking confidentiality and to try to conceal personal feelings I had on the issue, and so as to gain support. That obviously failed, and the fact I thought my opening post was relatively neutral speaks to how much I was deluding myself. So yes, I was trying to garner support for my position on the board in a manner that was far more manipulative than I what I did with you. For that, I apologize to the board. <br>So yes. To summarize, I was wrong, and I sincerely apologize to those I may have hurt. I did an incredibly stupid thing. It’s amazing how quickly you realize you’re wrong when you’re no longer angry.<br><br>And now, I am leaving. This is not a flounce. I fully intend to be back someday. I blame no-one but myself, and my own stupid actions, for my departure. I just need time away, and I assume that there are many of you who think that me being away is a good idea. </p>

            <p>This cleared up some confusion I had.<br><br>But there is something I do want to bring up to most people on this board. I returned to the PPC board to find this upheaval, and learning what&#39;s going on with people&#39;s processes, I can honestly say I am confused and disappointed in how many people are acting here. This board is meant to be a fun, safe place for mature people to talk and collaborate in a world which is being used as a tool for authors, especially ourselves, to grow.<br>I can&#39;t vouch for Jay and Acacia, not having known them. I can&#39;t vouch for July, Tawaki, Sedri, Nesh, and so many others here, since I am not them personally... And maybe my view is outdated, having only just returned to the boards...<br>But the PPC boards were never intended for something like this to occur.<br><br>I&#39;m probably overstepping my place by saying this, but I think a lot of people need to go back and look at the agreement they &#39;signed&#39; by joining the board. The one which says that the board is for enjoyment, not argument. If you have problems with someone, PM them directly, do not involve those around you, and especially do not let it spill over into the board.<br>As a returning member, I felt physical discomfort posting on this board to find this going on, in a place which had previously been safe, where disagreements were worked out, and didn&#39;t devolve into a discussion where people insulted each other as subtly as they could to see what they could get away with.<br>In the long and short of it, my point is that treat the PPC boards and its members in the way you would want to be treated. I understand anger was a part of it, but that is also dealt with in the constitution.<br><br>That&#39;s my two cents...</p>

            <p>&quot;I apologize to those who I may have leveled accusations against. Any accusations of wrongdoing in the case of mod selection are unfounded.&quot;<br><br>I probably should have said this more clearly. This was meant as my apology to July, nakkel and Artell.

July, I&#39;m very sorry about what I said about you. <br><br>Artell and nakkel, who I implied were selected in a less than an honest manner, were included here, too.

            <p>July appointed a non-PG, non-DA to full mod power. So in other words, nothing that I can see was ever discussed as part of the system. I&#39;ve disliked that the current mods were never voted on (and that the PGs were not mods like they were supposed to be) for quite some time, but it was close-ish to the kind-of spirit of what was discussed, so I didn&#39;t figure it was worth making a big deal about. I thought I might just have been confused. Now, I think it is worth getting some clarification on, which so far, I have not got. The point still stands that the community-voted system is not being used properly, or else it was changed, and never discussed on the board, and no changes were made to the wiki detailing these changes. </p>

            <p>You also keep changing your concern. <br><br>Maslab and Plat have never been PGs- but you have not expressed concern in this thread with regards to them having been previous choices as mods. They were also not voted on, contrary to your claim. <br><br>As has already been related, what a mod is there for and a DA is there for are entirely different purposes, and the setup is with the intent to prevent the abuse of power. <br><br>The community-voted system is only and has only ever been applicable to the DAs, as far as the chatroom has been concerned. <br><br>What I am concerned about is that I suspect that you are doing this purposefully because of <i>who</i> I chose, rather than any real concern for the community or the chatroom.  If it is about the person, rather than the system, it would be more honest for you to say that, rather than trying to twist everything around to supplement the agenda I have to suspect you have, at this point.<br><br>You have changed what you have said repeatedly with regards to what is told to you, both here and in the chatroom. You did not ask me anything with regards to your concerns in the chatroom at all. While I understand that the board has a permanence to it, it is also frankly quite surprising to see something on here without any warning, with things being phrased to appear as unfair as possible, and casting me in a position of being power hungry and abusing power.<br><br>Your first post gave the suggestion that I am an op, but should not be, since I was not voted for. <br><br>One of your next gave the suggestion that I should be an exception, of course, since I was the channel founder. <br>The last one which I just responded to gave even worse implications, since it is rather suggestive that I am trying to avoid the community on this subject, and am being a hypocrite.<br></p>

<li>I am 90% sure that Plat got voted in at some point, to be a DA. Perhaps that was after the move to the new channel. That&#39;s more than Nakkel or Artell.<br><br>2.  I missed my opportunity to complain when Artell was made a mod, and the fact that it has happened again is worrying.<br><br>3. Yes, but the original system did not call for the creation of more mods- it set up you, Maslab and Plat as mods, as well as any PGs who were not already DAs. (Or so I have been led to believe.) Creating new mods should be done democratically- that&#39;s the issue here, and what I have been saying- when we moved to the new channel, Plat and Maslab were de-modded, and you appointed Artell with no community vote. Perhaps it was discussed in the IRC, but I missed it.<br><br>4. This is not about nakkel. I find his trolling rather amusing. I harbor no ill feelings towards him. In fact, should we hold some kind of vote for a Mod, or DA votes again, and he is on the ballet, I would vote for him. He&#39;s a regular, and his &#39;disruptiveness&#39; is not harmful.<br><br>5. Honestly? Removing your OP powers would involve moving to a different channel, which is something I would like to see happen- mibbit chokes on the channel we currently have, and I would appreciate voting for who we have in charge. That is , however, a long term goal, so yes, for now, I would like to see the mod process democratized, which means stripping Artell and Nakkel of there powers. You would be an exception- as channel founder, removing your powers would be , at the very least, an inconvenience in the short term.<br><br>6. I was merely pointing out that the creation of the current DA/Mod system, with the first DA elections, was all carried out on the board. It is surprising that a change of the mod structure, which, while not technically democratically elected, was agreed upon by the board, was not in fact carried out on the board.<br><br><br>So yes: In summary, I would like greater democratization and transparency in the mod selection process. Either way, I don&#39;t think I have anything more to say on the subject.</li>

            <p>Since my name&#39;s been brought up in this I want to say a few things myself.<br><br>I don&#39;t actually remember when I was made operator on #PPC (the term I prefer to use since that&#39;s the term used for IRC), which goes to show how long I&#39;ve been operator. I think I was op already back when the channel was just a half-dozen people and wasn&#39;t considered as integral a part of the PPC as it is now. Two years ago, perhaps?<br><br>In any case, before I ever joined the PPC or #PPC, I was the network operator (different from a channel operator; I looked after an entire now-defunct IRC network as a member of an operator team) for several years, so I probably have the most experience looking after IRC channels. This is why I respectfully question the assumed premise that all mods should be chosen by a vote, since some technical expertise is involved as well. I think the system in place now is fine.<br><br>Of course as #PPC&#39;s operator I have not done very much; mostly house-keeping stuff like kicking for swearing if I&#39;m around when it happens, or kick-banning spammers. Before Nakkel I was the only operator in the European timezones so I&#39;m around when the other ops are asleep or at school/work, which is also quite useful.</p>

            <p>To, like, everything you&#39;ve said.<br><br>1-3. The mods have <i>always</i> been July&#39;s whim, at least since I joined, as I mentioned on the IRC. The wiki page on mods is just horribly outdated. Maslab and Plat ceased to be mods long before we moved servers, and Artell&#39;s pretty much always been a mod. The most recent crop were Joe, Nesh, and VM, but Vm quit, and Joe and Nesh stopped showing up regularly, so we needed some new ones.<br><br>4&amp;5. No, you&#39;re right. This isn&#39;t about Nakkel. In fact, you more or less just admitted that this was about July. If you really had a problem with the mod structure, I suspect you would have brought it up on the IRC. Because that&#39;s where everyone brings up IRC problems. Instead, you seem to have decided to use this as an opportunity to publicly call July out on the Board, where there&#39;s a wider audience. Which is vaguely cowardly, and definitely not behavior befitting a Designated Arbitrator. It&#39;s stuff like making sure the audience had the wrong context that caused the problems on the previous server that led to the creation of the DAs. Doing that on the board is Not Cool.<br><br>6. As far as I know, there has never been a change in the mod structure. July has always chosen mods based on who she thinks is best suited for the job at the time.<br><br>I have sat here, and I have read this going on most of the day, and I have tried to come up with a diplomatic response, because as a DA myself, I should try my best to be diplomatic. However, when you decide to try and tell me that this is actually all about you looking out for my boyfriend, despite having given at least three other reasons in the thread? My only conclusion is that not only are you trying to attack July, but you are trying to enlist my help because you know I&#39;ve had problems with her in the past. Which is also Not Cool.</p>

            <p>Tray is, at least at the moment, gone from the PPC due to July appointing nakkel as a mod. For obvious reasons (he&#39;s my friend, namely) this pissed me off. I assume <br><br>I have also had gripes about the current mod system, but, while I do think it should change, I wasn&#39;t prepared to get into anything like this over it. Then Tray told me he was leaving because of Nakkel&#39;s appointment<br><br>So I posted this thread. Not the most rational decision in the world. I posted it here, and not in the IRC, for two reasons. The first was that I wanted to make a point about making large public decisions on the board. The second was that I had an essay to write last night, and did not have the time for a mult-hour argument in the IRC.<br><br>I did not word things as well as I should have. At all. By any stretch of the imagination. This was, obviously, a poorly thought out knee jerk reaction. I tried to frame my anger at July in the context of displeasure with the system; obviously, I majorly failed at making a convincing case, and it came off as an unprovoked attack. That was not my intention. I truly did want to get the system changed. I still do. <br><br>Of course, the fact that Tray wanted to be left out of it mean that I COULD NOT SAY WHY I WAS SO ANGRY did not help, at all. (This morning, after seeing your reaction, he gave me permission to bring him up.) In hindsight, this was not the best way to go about it at all.</p>

            <p>In a word: Bullshit. And I have the logs to prove it. You said to me that I was right. That this was about July. You told EF you were sick of July driving people away,  nonw of whom she was actually responsible for leaving. You apparently told Phobos the same thing. You&#39;re using Tray leaving over a personal grudge <i>right now</i> just to get sympathy from whomever you can.<br><br>You, sir, are nothing more than a manipulative jackass who is using anyone and everyone you can just to get at July.

Since all of the involved parties are adults, I expect them to goddamn well act like it. If you&#39;ve got a problem with someone, you take it up with them. You don&#39;t start publicly attacking them under the guise of fixing problems or protecting people. As far as I know, none of us are politicians or twelve years old, so stop acting like it.</p>

            <p>Look, I understand as well as anyone getting upset over internal politics on behalf of a friend, but I think my point stands in my confusion post:<br><br>As near as I can tell, Nakkel has done nothing to abuse any power being an op gives. I don&#39;t see how a friend leaving on a basis of a personal grudge actually gives reason he shouldn&#39;t be have op status.

The fact that he left after Nakkel became a mod doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that it was Nakkel&#39;s appointment who caused him to leave. Has Tray SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU that it was Nakkel becoming a mod? If so, then this point is moot. If not, then don&#39;t imply that that&#39;s what caused him to leave.</p>

            <p>Dann has full powers because while he is a DA, he is also the one who set up the system and the rules currently enacted for the chatroom. He&#39;s also someone who <i>should</i> have access to all of the chatroom settings in case something gets screwed up by mistake, since he knows how to use IRC.  In short, he is tech(no) support. <br><br>To explain: <br><br>The DAs are group elected to keep order /and/ to review any punishments that would possible be needed for breaking the rules. The main point of the DAs is to ensure that the rules aren&#39;t broken in the first place, by helping keep it from getting to that point.<br><br>The point of mods is to- if required- ban or kick when the rules are broken. I choose the mods because I run the channel. This was discussed when the DA system and new rules were set up. While the PPC channel <i>is</i> for the PPC community, the mods are there in theory to step in to do the banning and kicking where it is required if I am not around and things get out of hand, despite the DAs being present.<br><br>This is to <i>prevent</i> the DAs from having all of the power in the chatroom, which they should not have, and in return they prevent abuse of power by the mods. <br><br>This is why the wiki says that the DAs are not mods, and that they are there to review punishments and keep the chat from descending into disorder. At no point does it say that the DAs are in charge of handing out punishment. They are there to decide whether or not it should be done, and if it was done, whether it was appropriate. <br><br>To use a simple example: Mods are to DAs as law enforcement is to the judicial system.</p>

            <p>The wiki also says all permission givers are mods. Last I checked, VM was a half-op. Maslab and Plat, also listed as mods, are no longer mods. I seem to remember them (and you) being voted on to be mods in the old channel. This is not the case here.</p>

            <p>But I&#39;m almost positive the mod thing was not. If you look at the wiki, all of the listed mods were first selected as DAs. At least, I remember them being voted on. For whatever reason, Maslab and Plat, who were listed as mods in the old channel, are no longer mods. Again, it seems that things have changed after the move, but I might be wrong there. I don&#39;t know- July told me in the IRC the new way things work was discussed in the IRC, and not on the board. That seems off, somehow, seeing as she herself claims the board is the heart of the community, and the last major decision (the DAs) was discussed on the board.<br></p>

            <p>I have a lot of favorite fics, and listing them would probably take all day, so here are a few of my top favorites):<br><br>*A History of Magic (Puella Magi Modoka Magica)<br>I&#39;ve always like history, so this concept of this fic for one of my recent favorite animes got my attention. It looks at the famous women throughout history who were magical girls... and also what that entails.<br><br>*The Pony POV series (My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic)<br>Remember at the beginning of season 2 when Discord basically broke the Mane Six? Well, this story takes a look at the psychological ramifications of such a thing... and BOY is it unpleasant. True, they turn out alright later on, but still, something bad happens to EVERYPONY. And don&#39;t get me started on the nightmare fuel... (Note: This one can only be found on DeviantArt, Equestria Daily won&#39;t take it for... stupid reasons.)<br><br>*The Mouse who Would be King (Kingdom Hearts)<br>An interesting take on how Mickey Mouse went from a troublesome deckhand to a great king. It&#39;s probably noncanon by now, but who cares when the story&#39;s so good?<br><br>*Fight for the Lost (Mass Effect)<br>A novelization of the second game, that expands more on the characters, while giving us a great story.<br><br>*Death and King&#39;s Cross (Harry Potter)<br>Takes a look at what becomes of certain characters after their deaths, and is sure to give you goosebumps as you read it.<br><br>...That reminds me, I should probably update my page on the Fic Recommendation section...</p>

            <p>Pokemon Master:<br>-An AU of the Pokйmon anime, Pokemon Master is solely responsible for the Dark!Pokйmon fanfictions which have sprung up in its wake. Several years ago, a breach in the dimensional walls allowed Dark Pokйmon to return to the world, ravaging and destroy any they come across.<br><br>Wings of Council:<br>-One of my personal favourites, the Wings of Council was one of the first fanfictions I read. The story follows Topaz Soarhire, a young girl who has won the chance to become a Pokйmon Trainer. This fanfiction is set in Johto, and includes several original Pokйmon.<br><br>Retribution:<br>-Team Rocket has taken over the world, and a secret organisation called Rocket Bane has risen to try to fight them.

            <p>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality:<br>-An AU fanfiction operating under the premise that instead of marrying Vernon (Who wants to name their first child Dudley?), Petunia instead marries a scientist, who passes on his logical outlook on life to Harry. Harry enters Hogwarts with a mind set on giving order to the seemingly chaotic world of magic.<br><br>The Brave New World:<br>-Another AU fanfiction, where Harry feels that Dumbledore has bee manipulating him to achieve his own goals. Harry rebels, and flees to America to continue his education.<br><br>Oh God Not Again!:<br>-Harry accidentally falls through the Veil which takes him to the past, just before he was to start at Hogwarts. One of the best Harry Potter fanfictions I&#39;ve read, and is incredibly funny.</p>

            <p>A good first entry!  I liked that you gave the two agents a bit of history together, which contrasts with most new agent pairs being complete strangers to each other.  I also like your mini design!  They&#39;re a great blend of &quot;cute and funny&quot; and &quot;unstable and dangerous.&quot;<br><br>A few grammar things.  A bit after introducing the first mini, you have, &quot;The redhead shuddered sat down all the way . . .&quot;  which should have an &quot;and&quot; in it.<br><br>A bit after that, the parenthetical (also known as the dummy) is ending in an emoticon, which I&#39;m guessing is formating wonkiness with Webs.<br><br>Also, neuralyzer is spelled, uh, neuralyzer, rather than neuralizer.<br><br>Those are all things that would have been caught by a beta (presumably).

            <p>I&#39;m not that familiar with Soul Eater myself, but I did enjoy reading your mission. I thought that the byplay between your agents was really well done, and they clearly had a bit of history between them.<br><br>I did spot a couple of what could be typos, or could just be the difference between UK English / American English etc., but nothing major (like I said, I&#39;m not actually sure that they *are* mistakes). <br><br>One thing that did occur to me however, was the possible incorrect use of the neuralyzer; at the end of the mission, Lisa tells the canons &#39;Now look at the pretty light, everyone...&#39; and *then* uses the neuralyzer on them, leaving them &#39;dazed&#39;. My understanding is that you give the false memory when they are in the dazed state, when they are actually suggestible enough to believe it. Also, if you give them the memory first and then flashy thing them, you&#39;re going to erase the false memory as well as the actual events that took place. Sorry to be pedantic, but I do have a tendency to... obsess a little, when it comes to tech. <br><br>Overall I thought it was very good though, and I hope I can put as interesting character interactions between the agents for my first mission as you managed in this. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m so horrible at remembering all that technology stuff that it isn&#39;t even funny. Extremely sorry for that.

            <p>The way my brain works just makes it easy for me to remember obscure bits of technical knowledge, but on the other hand, I can&#39;t remember how to correctly use an apostrophe. Seriously, if my spellchecker doesn&#39;t sort it out for me, most of the time I figure I&#39;ve got a 50/50 chance of getting it right, which is probably good enough. <br><br>Off the top of my head, I can think of a couple of simple ways of dealing with the neuralyzer. Depending on how easy it is for you to edit a story once you&#39;ve posted it, you could just swap the couple of lines so that the canons are flashy thinged (flashy thinged...? flashy thingied...? I&#39;m not sure) before they get given the new memory. Then it works as normal. If you don&#39;t want to (or can&#39;t) change what you&#39;ve written, then you could just bring it up next time as a mistake that Lisa made. She&#39;d just done her first mission, had her partner get taken out of action, and had to perform an exorcism solo (which judging from her dialogue at the time she wasn&#39;t 100% confident about). I think that would be enough to shake someone up so that they forget things, or do stuff in the wrong order.<br>True, she seemed far more confident once the wraith had been disposed of, but people can easily be confident and wrong. <br><br>I&#39;m slowly getting better at PPC specific tech, so if you do have any questions about the rest of it, I might be able to help out. </p>

            <p>You did well with your first mission. You&#39;ve begun to develop the ongoing relationship between your agents, which seems violent, but hey, that&#39;s not uncommon for the PPC.<br><br>There were a couple of spelling and grammatical errors here and there. Nothing major, but there&#39;s the whole throwing stones around glass houses principles here, unfortunately. You don&#39;t need an outright beta, just a second person to look over it. You are your own worst critic after all!<br><br>The thing I would like to point out that may need improving is a focus on the story itself. While you did show in the first mission of your two agents their interactions, there wasn&#39;t a lot of the story being looked at. Some more direct quotes, maybe, or having the agents summarise what&#39;s about to happen next are two ways you could do it. You just need to explain why you&#39;re PPCing this fic, and not another one.<br><br>But, as I said before, you&#39;ve started on character development and had fun along the way. At the very least, you avoided making an Agent Mini, which I managed to do on my first mission. Otherwise, congratulations on the successful completion of your first mission!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not completely familiar with the inner workings of the Slashy side of the PPC, having concentrated most of my reading so far on the Dept. of Mary Sues, but I would think that, if it were given a specific category, it would be a Division within the Department of Bad Slash. After all, there are already Divisions within DBS that deal with Yiff and Bad Het, and I don&#39;t think it would be considered large enough to warrant its own Department.<br><br>Having said that, the definition of Slash given on the wiki page of that name is &#39;romance and/or sex between two characters of the same gender&#39;, so while Femslash could be considered a more niche subset, I would say that it already fell in the jurisdiction of normal DBS agents. <br><br>Probably best for someone with a little more knowledge/experience to confirm or deny that though. </p>

            <p>As the Board&#39;s resident Italian, I have the responsability to correct this misconcept.<br><br>True Pizza has exactly five ingredients in the topping:<br><br>- Tomato sauce<br>- Mozzarella cheese<br>- Oregano<br>- A couple of basil leaves<br>- Olive oil<br><br>I am not against putting other stuff on it (I often add wurstel and fried potatoes on it), but please do not refer at those as True Pizza.</p>

            <p>You have challenged the very foundations of my concept of pizza! Although I have to say that given your heritage, you are probably better placed to make a judgement on True Pizza than I am. <br><br>I shall continue to enjoy my Fake!Pizza with all the extra toppings I can fit on it. </p>
