            <p>Am I allowed to claim a badfic as my first mission before attempting to get Permission? (Provided that I actually wait until I have Permission to tackle said badfic - which I shall, because otherwise it would be silly to try it.)<br><br>If I can claim a badfic as my Permission badfic, I would very much like to take down Rainbow Factory. I&#39;ve read the fic twice - once out of morbid curiosity, the second time for a drinking game related to how many times the characters <i>swore</i> - and I really, really want it to die.<br><br>In case someone isn&#39;t familiar, I&#39;m referring to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1td5r9BGGA7l2-rnlFTnVrJN2NdZclcVWUMoCqaSujnM/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;pli=1">this</a> Rainbow Factory. Similarly to Gaspard, I&#39;d like to get Orion out of there. <i>Yesterday,</i> but, as I said, I&#39;ll wait &#39;til Permission.</p>

She&#39;s very limited in terms of what she can afford to do, because she doesn&#39;t have access to a power source.  If I ever do a Nasu fic, I&#39;ll probably write the full combat.<br><br>(On the DOWN side, I now have to live up to expectations of awesome.  Bugger.)</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve said some of this before, but:<br><br>The reason I like the idea of nominations is that it encourages involvement with each other, and it <i>dis</i>courages people from shoehorning things into missions simply to meet requirements for getting a Sue page, which is my concern about relying on guidelines and common sense. Everybody wants to make their mark, which is fine, but I think the truest test of that is the impact their work has on the rest of us. For that reason, I think there should also be a minimum wait time before a particular Sue can be nominated—maybe a couple of weeks or a month from when the mission is posted. If the Sue can be forgotten about in such a relatively short time, it probably wasn&#39;t that big a deal.<br><br>To respond to a specific suggestion, I think having a certain number of charges be a guideline is an especially easy to exploit idea, and I&#39;m against it. Charge lists have already ballooned massively from what they were in past years; they don&#39;t need any encouragement. The quality ought to be more important than the quantity in any case.<br><br>Whatever we do, I think it will be important to keep in mind what qualities the Sue has on its own and what qualities come from the author(s) of the mission. Either of these can be important. For instance, I think Archir the Emerald made an impact because what Tungsten and I did with him conceptually at the end was unique, at least as much if not more than because of what he got up to in the actual badfic (though our agents probably still have nightmares about some of that). On the other hand, something like the Balrog Sue or Solaris (to say nothing of Legendary Sues) stands out because of her own spectacular and unique awfulness.<br><br>Either way, the key is unique and memorable, IMO.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>PS.

            <p>Just one question though, should we be able to nominate Sues from our own missions, or should it be that other people do the nominating?<br><br>I only ask because you mentioned having a waiting time to make sure they&#39;re memorable enough to be placed on the Wiki (which I think sounds perfectly reasonable), and I would think that the author(s) of a mission are going to remember the Sue for a while anyway, just because of the amount of time/effort it takes to write a mission. </p>

            <p>Because, as you say, mission authors are going to remember the stuff they wrote because they wrote it, regardless of anything else.<br><br>That said, though, it might not hurt to have a way for people to speak up for their own work in the event that no one else does. Maybe after half a year or something, if you still really feel like your Sue/mission was something big on a wide scale, then you can self-nominate?<br><br>Just my thought.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>This sounds good to me. I may be a bit weird here, but not all of the Sues and author phantoms I wrote really stand out to me. It has been a while since I wrote most of them, but if you put a long enough waiting period on it, even the authors should maybe only be thinking of the memorable ones.</p>

            <p>...that the Sues mentioned there must be significant in some way.<br><br>I recently added a Sue to the category myself; I thought she was a good definition of the modern thinly-veiled Sue - that is, a girl who lurks in a grammatically correct and rather well-written (meaning prose style not very shabby) story, doesn&#39;t blatantly interfere with the Canon, and somehow still manages to derail the plot to suit her purposes. <br><br>So generally I think there could just be notable &#39;types&#39; of Sues in the category. Sues that stand out for one reason or another, Sues whose missions have defined their Agents in some way, affected or traumatised them, whatever... those are the kinds that ought to be on the wiki, imo.</p>

            <p>Assuming you don&#39;t trust the PPC to work with something like &#39;Please only add your Mary-Sue if (s)he is notable for some reason&#39;... well, here&#39;s some suggested types that should(?) be added:<br><br>-Multi-mission Sues (eg Marissa Picard)<br>-Sues who have an effect on later PPC stories (eg Sairalinde, through her ring)<br>-Sues who are killed in a collaboration (eg Alumia - where collaboration implies more than two PPC writers. This would suggest that whoever Dafydd, Alec and Neshomeh killed on Pern would need a page, since there were three of us)<br>-Sues from agreed Legendary Badfics (eg Celebrian)<br>-Sues who did something spectacular to the PPC (no examples, but if an agent got killed, or the Sue got loose in HQ, for example)<br>-Sues who are from barely-used continuua/the first from a continuum, if this is noted in the mission (eg that Pern Sue again, and possibly that Lineland thing Narto and Lou killed, if it even had a Sue)<br>-Sues who are written about at some length on another page (so, for instance, if their biology inspires the DMSE&amp;R, and is therefore talked about on the DMSE&amp;R page... although this would fall under &#39;effect on later stories&#39; anyway)<br>-Sues killed by Jay and Acacia (this will probably not get used much... :P)<br><br>I&#39;d still prefer to assume common sense, but if not, this breaks down pretty much what my definition of &#39;use common sense&#39; actually /means/.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not newbie, I left without warning a long time ago due to some real life issues and then didn&#39;t come back because I was worried about the awkwardness of it all.

            <p>Good to have you back. I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met before, as I only joined up back in May, but I&#39;d like to welcome you back all the same. It seems a lot of oldbies have been making a return as of late... I guess the wonderful insanity of it all could not be ignored.

            <p>I don&#39;t know a huge amount about Kingdom Hearts myself, but just based on reading the first few chapters I&#39;d say you&#39;re probably not overreacting.<br><br>First off you&#39;ve got a Girl Who Falls Into <s>Middle Earth</s> Kingdom Hearts, and while it isn&#39;t the classic walk through a plothole to get there, the bodyswap thing is pretty daft, and most of the later explanations of the mechanics of the &#39;curse&#39; seem to contradict the earlier info.  <br><br>There&#39;s also some extra Artefacts of Power floating around, in the form of the Book and the Rose, one of which the Sue has taken. And then there&#39;s the Chosen One-esque title &#39;Guardian of Dawn&#39;, something Liz was apparently destined to become, despite being born in a different dimension. Honestly, the coincidences are really starting to pile up here. <br><br>There were a bunch of other little things as well: Ven listening to World One bands is a bit of a stretch, even more so seeing as they all seem to be Liz&#39;s favourite bands too, and that bit with Liz&#39;s mum and Harry Potter...<br><br>I&#39;d say you were dealing with a Sue, Maybe not the worst one out there, but a Sue nonetheless.<br></p>

            <p>Browsing the Just In page of the Harry Potter section of the pit has brought these to my notice.<br><br>I&#39;d probably say this one&#39;s just on the watch list: the grammar is acceptable and so far I don&#39;t think that the OC has racked up any major canon breakages, (other than the title &quot;The Fifth Marauder,&quot;) and has somehow become friends with Lilly and Snape, despite being pureblood and two years younger than them both. (The given excuse is that they all live on the same street... or something.)<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8558109/1/The-Fifth-Marauder-Teaser"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8558109/1/The-Fifth-Marauder-Teaser">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8558109/1/The-Fifth-Marauder-Teaser</a></a><br><br>Also, doesn&#39;t the pit of voles have a policy against making separate stories for &quot;teaser&quot; or prologue bits that should go in the actual story? This was posted today, but labeling it a teaser smacks of not having read the rules. <br><br>The next one is a grammar-deprived mess. It gives us mention of the mini-Aragog Grodrics Hollow (does he belong to anyone?) as well as baby Harry described as a &quot;lovely angle&quot;  and the first chapter consists of dialogue. Actually, most of it is whiplash-inducing pacing and bad dialogue. <br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6814846/1/Arranged"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6814846/1/Arranged">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6814846/1/Arranged</a></a><br><br>The third I hope is a parody, because the OC is part demugise. Yes, you read that correctly. This one is also a &quot;Teaser,&quot; and I just now checked: it&#39;s from the same author as the first OC. The grammar remains acceptable. Roxora appears to only have the charges of being an extracannonical offspring, an unholy demugise hybrid, and interrupting a fight scene to give us her life story. Also, the author appears fond of the name Alexis. Like the first fic, I think this deserves watching, but it only has one chapter right now. <br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8558082/1/Roxora-Alexis-Lupin-Teaser"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8558082/1/Roxora-Alexis-Lupin-Teaser">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8558082/1/Roxora-Alexis-Lupin-Teaser</a></a><br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not completely sure, because I don&#39;t recognize all the names mentioned, but it looks like he took a bunch of characters from different fandoms and has created an impossible web and back story for them. Starring in the show would be his OCs, the one named James being the most prominent and definitely the most &#39;Stu-ish. Some of the lines that concern me would be:<br><br>&quot;James is the doctor Adopted brother he is the Master Assassin but he never kills&quot;<br><br>&quot;when is family was taken he was taken sort refuge on the planet of Pandora where he lurned the Na&#39;vi ways he lived with a clan called the omaticaya he was well respected in the clan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Amy is James best friend when growing up ( lets kill Hitler will explain) but when he moved they lost contacted they went to the same school but thanks to the doctor there friendship as bean lifted once more.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Joseph song is the doctor son he was born on the planet of sholon through the DNA from his farther and mother. his life starches from the 21st to the 51st century he travels in his own TARDIS and his own companion in the Name of April smith ( Joseph song Adventures part 1 coming soon) he has the madness of his farther and the brains of his mother but can Joesph song become the new doctor ?. After the events of demons run Amy pond is now his grandmother and Rory his grandfather&quot;<br><br>The main universe seems to be Doctor who, but as there is Avatar and, looking at other fics, Assassin&#39;s Creed, Family Guy, Being Human, Thor, and the Avengers. This being a series, it&#39;s probably going to be a big job, not to mention that Floaters will have to take care of it because it contains both &#39;Stus and crossovers. Either that or it could be a combined mission, as there&#39;s certainly enough for everybody.That&#39;s just my input though.<br><br>~TO, who has found enough people calling her this to make it a sort of signature. </p>

            <p>If it appears that way, I apologise. I was basing my theory off of what I have read of my two younger brother&#39;s writing, an that of their and my peers in fifth grade. I have met an eleven year old who has written better fanfiction than I have, so I know there are probably numerous faults with the line of reasoning that would lead to generalisation. On the male portion of my deduction, I was reasoning that in most cases males tend to produce Stus, and females, Sues. In either case I could easily be proven wrong. Again, I meant no offence to any particular age group or gender.</p>

            <p>What missions are these from, mang? With out a mission there are no minis.

            <p>In fact, technically they&#39;re more OFU territory than PPC, since it was Miss Cam who came up with them first. So you technically don&#39;t need a mission, or even an agent in said continuum, to have a mini type.<br><br>(Also, I don&#39;t think the protocol is massively strict; I have a mini hnakra from <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i>, Hyio, around somewhere, and that&#39;s never had a mission or an OFU, or even a large fanbase.)</p>

            <p>My point is more that they need a source. You can&#39;t just note misspelling in a fic and come back and say &quot;hey guys!

            <p>attention with the subject heading. :P)<br><br>I think that a while back, maybe around the time that I joined, that everyone was asked to not create any more new mini types without writing for that new mini type either via an OFU or a mission/other PPC writing to reserve the thrill of new mini creation for the first person to care strongly enough about the fandom to write for it. And having created a couple of mini types through missions, I have to say that it is a pretty big thrill that I really do think should be reserved for the first writer in that fandom.<br><br>That said, I don&#39;t see a real problem with posting new mini names for already established mini types, especially for relatively rare fandoms like ACD&#39;s Holmes-verse. <br><br>My only protocol type request is that anyone posting new mini names please put the mini&#39;s names on the proper list. Whether the list is on the wiki or an individual maintains it. <br><br>Just for reference for folks who haven&#39;t heard about it in a long time (or ever for newbies) I maintain the <a href="http://miah-arthur.livejournal.com/14718.html">NCIS Mini Adoption Center </a> and if someone posted a comment to that post I would (eventually) see it and add the names to the list. Likewise for anyone wanting to adopt an NCIS mini. Just feel free to snag the mini for your PPC personnel and leave a message about it, and I will get the list updated. I don&#39;t check this very frequently, so I am definitely not asking for anyone to wait on me updating to start using the mini in their stories.</p>

            <p>(First off, thankies to doctorlit and Riese for beta-ing for me. Hugs for everyone!)<br><br>Now then, on to business.<br><br><b>Agents:</b><br><b>Agent Veralyn Amberwing</b> is the severely unfortunate victim of one World of Warcraft player&#39;s intense <s>hatred</s> disliking for blood elves. Her semi-fic blip of origin would have had Veralyn meet a horrific end at the claws and teeth of several demons; fortunately, her uncanonical age opened a plot hole that swallowed her up before they could finish her off, and Veralyn (along with her dragonhawk companion, Firebrand) fell right into the home of Caroline Moor. While the blonde blood elven huntress was badly scarred by the encounter, she is the first to admit that the damage might have been far worse if she hadn&#39;t managed to land on someone familiar with blood elves...ignoring of course the &#39;exchange of apologies&#39; immediately following her landing, which involved knives, kitchen utensils, and a Pop Tart.<br><br>Despite now being a far more canonical 117 years of age, Veralyn still behaves in much the same way as a human in her mid-twenties (which, considering the canonical maturation rate of blood elves, is probably just about right). She is also suffering from a bad case of Broken Haughty, and as such tends to react...poorly...to being embarrassed or surprised, a trait which of course only makes it all the more fun for Caroline and Firebrand to antagonize her. It should be noted that she will flinch and may react violently if someone comes up on her blind side. Having nowhere to go on World One and no idea how to return to her own continuum,Veralyn grudgingly followed Caroline to the PPC, and was immediately given a job...and the aggravation of being Caroline&#39;s partner. Veralyn was a skilled leatherworker prior to her run-in with an anti-sin&#39;dorei writer, though her work these days is significantly slower due to her new lack of depth perception. Veralyn harbors an immense fear of heights and will freeze if she looks down from a height of more than five feet.<br><br><b>Agent Caroline Moor</b> is a young human female from World One who willingly volunteered for a job at the PPC after becoming thoroughly frustrated with the lack of job opportunities in her home town. Due to her messy brown hair, blue-green eyes, and thin-framed glasses, there is very little that is eye-grabbing about her appearance, save perhaps the sheer ordinariness of it. She and Veralyn encountered each other immediately following Veralyn&#39;s near-death, and though the two months following had Caroline dodging racial slurs and veiled threats from the prickly sin&#39;dorei (not to mention enduring a sometimes-violent crash-course in the English language for Veralyn), Caroline bears no ill will towards the blood elf and tends to be equal parts loyal to- and irritable with her partner.<br><br>As far as her personality goes, Caroline alternates between hyperactivity and an almost sloth-like calmness, and prefers to avoid conflict when she can – although she is fiercely protective of her Lust Objects, Favorites, and fandoms. She also harbors a bit of a maternal instinct for rough-and-tumble characters (such as Rainbow Dash of the <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i> continuum and the mischievous Firebrand) and is an unwavering proponent of the underdog and persons or fandoms which she perceives to have been unfairly condemned. She sings, but usually does so at such a soft volume and low pitch that most humans would have to strain a bit to catch the words; the only time she really sings loud enough to be heard is when she is part of a choir or in a very chaotic public setting. She is highly ticklish, and will squeal when poked. <i>Loudly.</i><br><br><b>Agent Pictures:</b> <a href="http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll151/Sasayaki_Itami/WoWScrnShot_090412_170425-1.png?t=1346874370">Veralyn (accompanied by Firebrand)</a> and <a href="http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll151/Sasayaki_Itami/CarolineMoor.png?t=1347511246">Caroline</a><br><br><b>Agent Fandoms</b><br><b>Agent Veralyn</b> is only well-versed in the Warcraft fandom, since this is her continuum of origin. However, as she borrowed Caroline&#39;s many books as a means to pass the time (and aid her in learning World One English), she has become intrigued by the works of Tamora Pierce and already knows a fair bit about two-thirds of the <i>Provost&#39;s Dog</i> trilogy (which she refers to as the <i>Beka Cooper</i> trilogy.) It&#39;s worth noting that she plans to extend her knowledge of Pierce&#39;s works and has been eyeing Caroline&#39;s copy of the Silmarillion of late.<br><br><b>Agent Caroline</b> has a larger range of fandoms, with varying levels of expertise. In no real order, she is knowledgeable about the Warcraft-verse, the <i>Warriors</i>-verse, the MLP-verse, the Tolkien-verse, the <i>Twilight</i>-verse, and the Pierce-verse. She also has a smattering of familiarity with the Naruto-verse.<br><br><b>Requested Department:</b> Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br><b>Requested Response Center:</b> RC #16<br><br><b>Writing Sample:</b> <a href="http://kittynoodles.dreamwidth.org/2012/09/25/">“You <i>Again‽</i>”</a><br><br><b>First Badfic:</b> <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/5381/1/Rainbow-Factory/Rainbow-Factory">”Rainbow Factory” by Aurora Dawn</a></p>

            <p>Neshomeh&#39;s Comments:<br><br>(Because, as Phobos reminded me, I haven&#39;t done anything Permission-y in a while.)<br><br>I agree that there&#39;s a bit of over-description going on in the sample, but that&#39;s about the only criticism I can come up with (though I did catch a missing period at the end of the second paragraph). To repeat a piece of advice I was myself given at one point, you don&#39;t have to spend time on small details such as the precise behavior of an earbud cord. This description isn&#39;t vital for the reader to understand the scene—if Caroline is listening to an iPod with earbuds, it&#39;s safe to assume there&#39;s a cord extending from one to the other, behaving as cords normally do—so all it really does is slow things down. More important are bigger things such as her style of dress, which I don&#39;t think you mentioned.<br><br>Again, though, that&#39;s pretty much all I&#39;ve got. I like your agents, and although I worry a little about Caroline and I hope she&#39;ll eventually stand up for herself and stop taking Veralyn&#39;s BS, I can happily look forward to that kind of character development in the spin-off. I think you&#39;ve got a solid foundation for their relationship, with strong characterization on both sides, and wherever you take it should make for an interesting ride.<br><br>I wonder what kind of temper-tantrum Veralyn will throw when she finds out about Regulation 5C (no pets on missions). And I&#39;m kind of fascinated by the existence of another half-blind agent with facial scarring, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br><br>Phobos&#39; Comments:<br><br>I second what Nesh said.  When you start to write missions, make sure you tell your beta(s) to be on the lookout for that sort of thing.<br><br>On a personal note, Barid and Brightbeard are happy that they have someone to potentially take some of their workload.  Also, Barid is a Tailor/Enchanter and Brightbeard is a Miner/Blacksmith.  There may be some sort of arrangement that could be reached, and perhaps a market for everyone&#39;s goods could be established.  Also, if you ever decide to do a Warcraft mission, feel free to use Voltarmi.<br><br>~Phobos and Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Nice job on getting Permission! I really like that sorta-hostile-but-not-quite dynamic between your two agents. I have a feeling that it will lead to some very interesting interactions... I will definitely be keeping an eye on these two.<br><br>As for the piece itself, I think the PGs and Sevenswans have already pointed out the few things that can be improved. Keep up the good work!<br><br><br><br>P.S: About the Rainbow Factory... Have you ever listened to the original song by WoodenToaster?

            <p>But I did like the introductory piece. It&#39;s slightly description-heavy, but then introductions tend to be.

            <p>Yes, I know, another post about chatroom business, another wail of the leaderless multitude, et cetera, etc.<br><br>The thing is, we&#39;ve been noticing that the IRC doesn&#39;t have a whole ton of mods (I think we have... two? Plus the Bot, which can kick for mechanical infractions, but can&#39;t ban in the case of trolls, and doesn&#39;t have the human perception to note people violating Rule One), and the DAs are lacking in pretty much any power whatsoever. This is partially the point, as I think DAs were put in place less to wield Cudgels Of Authority and more to remind people they were trampling toes, but with few DAs and fewer mods, people are beginning to worry about issues arising. Also, because it has been brought up in the past, Mods aren&#39;t perfect, Mods are human, and therefore very much capable of violating Rule One, getting into arguments that upset people, saying hurtful things, and so on - I&#39;ve certainly done it. Right now, DAs have no power to kick mods, and have to rely entirely on the mod who&#39;s causing problems to relent, apologize, listen to reason, and/or withdraw. As I said, we haven&#39;t had a serious issue arise in a while, but I know I&#39;ve gotten in arguments with people on the chat, and Plat&#39;s had to sort of forcefully go &quot;Take this elsewhere, or stop talking about it,&quot; and although I really really really appreciate his skill and tactfulness in doing so, it would really make his job - the job of any and all DAs - much easier if they could go &quot;Take this elsewhere, or stop talking about it; if you refuse, I will kick the lot of you until you come to your senses.&quot;<br><br>I personally haven&#39;t seen any massive behavioral issues, and I haven&#39;t heard anything about such, so this might seem a bit like jumping the gun or looking for trouble. But, as with Permission-Giver Census, I&#39;d rather see this averted before anything has a chance to pop up, rather than waiting until crisis hits and then scrambling amidst the impending waves of drama.<br><br>I should also clarify, here - I&#39;m not worrying about people going out and being jerks and bullies to each other. I really do think we&#39;re above that; what with the issues that popped up here some months ago, I think we now have the framework and the precedent and the backup in the Constitution to shut that sort of thing down, and that&#39;s a huge step in the right direction. What I&#39;m more worried about is situations like trolls, people wandering into the IRC from other channels or wherever, with the idea of causing mayhem and anger. If neither of the mods are around, which is very easily possible, since we only have two, and the troll breaks no Bot-programmed rules, there&#39;s a lot of really nasty damage they could do with the space.<br><br>Basically, ideas to solve this have been tossed around, discussed, put aside, and then picked up again. The one that came to attention most recently is regularly-spaced elections for both Mods and DAs - that way, we don&#39;t wind up with anyone put up as a Mod who&#39;s not a regular, and winds up disappearing; if someone does disappear, it only lasts until the next election. Likewise with DAs, we can vote on regulars who appear to be really good at keeping the peace and not going mad with power.<br><br>The spacing that was suggested was mods every 2 months, and DAs every three months, and that nobody be allowed to serve two consecutive terms.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely one-hundred percent sure on the serving of two consecutive terms, what with the occasional lack of steady and really-good-at-authority regulars en masse, but that&#39;s a matter for A Lot Of People to talk about and decide, I think.<br><br>My further additions would be <br>1) to have the elections for both be on the seasonal equinoxes and midpoints, since those are relatively easy to remember, evenly spaced by definition, and tend to make excellent Beginnings And Endings, psychologically speaking.<br>2) to up the mod-count to three or four at each election, and the DA count to four or five.<br>3) if it is at all possible, to give DAs full admin-stars, instead of half-stars, for the purpose of allowing them to kick mods when necessary.<br><br><br>The form that has been suggested/put together for said elections is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFR2bnRwVS1oUEp6R011aThsOGlUY2c6MQ">here</a>.<br><br>Addendum: Does <i>anyone</i> know whether or not to capitalize the word &quot;Mod&quot;? It&#39;s driving me crazy, I think I just went back and forth at least three times.<br>---IRC Channel Business Over---<br><br>Aaaand having finished that, let me just confuse the threads even more by throwing in a personal point of opinion - have we ever put in place a system of How To Talk About Harassment?<br><br>I mean... let me clarify, with that. One of the major things that threw me about the Really Big Explosion some months ago was that so very few of us had any idea that harassment of Boarders had been going on, partly because most of it, IIRC, took place out of public eye. If someone doesn&#39;t openly do horrible things in community space, but hides them behind shadows and walls, is there any way, besides exposing yourself with a massive Community Alert Message, to tell someone, explain what&#39;s going on, get help?<br><br>Because it kinda seems like we should have one. I&#39;d hope it never becomes necessary, but just in case, it might save a lot of people a lot of emotional wear in the future.</p>

            <p>Apparently we are worried about mods abusing their position to become exempt from the rules of the community. What some of you may not know is that I am the <i>only</i> op on the IRC with the exception of Dann, who rarely visits and who I&#39;m sure is exempt from the elections by virtue of being the only person with the know-how to keep the place running.<br><br>By my own admittance, I&#39;m a poor tyrant. My iron grip on the chatroom is anything but and the improper use of my powers is profund: indeed, I have barely used them at all. I have no problem with other mods being elected to assist(I&#39;d put money on them being better mods than myself) since I obviously can&#39;t be on all day, but a primary component of these proposals is the ousting of the mods given power through the current system, which amounts to me since all the others have left. These changes are the result of the community&#39;s collective distrust of authority popping up again, something that amuses and disgusts me in equal measure since it is a perennial concern among this comunity despite no mod, op, or PG doing ANYTHING to deserve such suspicion in the two and a half years I have been here. Indeed, it seems that the ops have more to fear from the people than the other way around as last year&#39;s events have proven. I&#39;m amused that these people continue to tell you that the moderation is something that must be chained up and controlled for fear of power tripping as the only unchecked ambition I have seen so far is theirs, and it never ceases to amaze that you continue to buy it despite no evidence ever being presented that this is the case. This attitude is part of the problem that <i>caused</i> the mass exodus earlier this year because apparently mods are the exception to the &quot;harassment is bad&quot; rule.<br><br>But I digress. Whether the target is myself or the @ beside my name, it is a bad time to be me, and with there being a grand total of nine ops in a room that barely ever breaks fifteen people(and really, what is the difference between an op and a DA in this plan? You&#39;re aware that the regulatory body now has the same powers, if not more, than the body they are meant to regulate?), I am no longer necessary nor do I wish to remain. You may do as you please. Keep chasin&#39; that phantom fascist, folks. If you need me, I will be with the devil in his elite Siberian resort hunting a vampire.

            <p>I definitely didn&#39;t have in mind to target you (or Plat) when I said I like the idea of rotating people in and out. You both seem to handle it well. I&#39;ve seen people get stressed before and (not that I&#39;d ever be in a DA position but if I were) I&#39;d be stressed if I was stuck in the position permanently and I&#39;d want to rotate out to alleviate that, so my support of that was me projecting how I&#39;d feel in the position onto the position and this vote.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry if I made either of you feel like I was saying you are or have been doing a bad job.</p>

            <p>I have a pair of thoughts...<br><br>Firstly, we tend to not see each other much, because I&#39;m at work until well after midnight GMT, and then it&#39;s an hourlong commute home.

            <p>I visit the IRC about once in a blue moon (generally when I&#39;m reminded it exists :P ) but I&#39;m glad to see that people are considering ways to keep things from getting too out of hand. That&#39;s been something of an issue for me - whenever I wander in, things seem to get unpleasant and I leave again because I don&#39;t want to be entangled in all of that. More people who can keep unpleasantness from getting out of hand can only be a Good Thing.<br><br><br>Regarding the How To Talk About Harassment issue, I&#39;m willing to be involved in helping out there. (As most of you guys probably know, I&#39;m more or less the eternal peacemaker around here, so this topic really appeals to me. :P) The suggestions made in-thread - having the equivalent of a support line available for people who feel they&#39;re being harassed - seems pretty good to me, as long as we have a few people willing to join in the support network... and, maybe, a formal way to deal with the issue other than just offering sympathy.<br><br>My personal suggestion for how to handle it:<br><br>1. Someone contacts one of the volunteers manning the support line (referred to hereafter as &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;), saying they&#39;re being harassed.<br><br>2. We reply, letting them know we take them seriously, and promise to investigate. We also get as much detail as we can about the harassment.<br><br>3. We then contact the person/people/beings/sentient cheeseburger/etc. alleged to have been causing the harassment, explaining the situation and asking for their side of the story.<br><br>4a. If they reply with an explanation for their behaviour, understand they&#39;ve upset the first person, and (IMPORTANTLY) seem genuinely remorseful, talk to both parties and get them to make up. Essentially, mediation to talk the whole thing over and smooth it out. The issue should be resolved.<br><br>4b. If they reply trying to explain away their behaviour as being justified (and there is no reasonable justification), we politely but firmly ask them to knock it off, as whatever their feelings on the matter making someone miserable is not in the spirit of the PPC, and we have a whole shiny member-written Constitution to back that up.<br><br>5. If the issue doesn&#39;t stop at polite requests to quit it, it&#39;s time to take more action; call in other members of the support line to discuss what the next course of action is. Telling the harasser to leave the PPC? Requesting that they cut all contact with the person they&#39;ve been harassing? I&#39;m open to suggestion here. However, splashing it all over the Board should not be an easy option; we&#39;ve seen how that goes. A few reasonable people can get together and talk it out without calling in the entire community.<br><br>So, guys... thoughts?<br><br>- Cassie, trying to be proactive for once</p>

            <p>Your steps for dealing with harassment sound logical, thorough, and most likely effective. It&#39;s very important to have some form of hotline, I think, and just as important to have steps 3 and 4. I think most hurt feelings come about due to misunderstandings or ignorance of how one person&#39;s actions are affecting another person&#39;s feelings, and both of those can be dealt with much more effectively through mediation than letting them fester until they explode all over the Board. Obviously not in all situations, as some people are just jerks and intent on remaining jerks, which is why there is a step 5. <br><br>In the case of those intent on being jerks, there are the guidelines in the constitution for how to deal with them. I would suggest that if one of those consequences must be activated that a summary post made by the mediator/mediators (maybe by the Nameless Mediator) stating as neutrally as possible, &quot;Person X has been banned for breaking Rules 2, 5, and 8 of the PPC Constituion. This was handled with all due process through the Harassment Hotline and this was the last available measure. All involved parties have already been informed of the consequences. Details are being withheld to protect the privacy of involved parties&quot;<br><br>That way the Board is notified as to why Person X is no longer around, and says clearly that there is no cause for drama to erupt, because the situation has already been dealt with. <br><br>Okay, it might be wishful thinking on my part to think that no one would get dramatic over such a thing, but it is at least an attempt, and a clear statement that the situation is under control.</p>

            <p>And as for harassment things - I suggest coming up with a... well, hotline of sorts? Like, people can volunteer contact information so that Boarders who are feeling harassed can contact them for help and so forth. I know for sure that my email and Tumblr ask box are always open for all of you guys. <br><br>And you can make that a page on the Wiki, and link to it on the Board and the IRC and stuff. </p>

            <p>(Wow. A lot of support and awesome and thanks, guys, I was a bit worried about this!)<br><br>1) Not my post, not my ideas! All of this was discussion with other people, catalyzed by talking to Tray. Very little of this is original content. Just... um, for the record.<br>(Let me also clarify that because this was the conglomeration of other people&#39;s ideas, what I meant by &quot;I&#39;m not entirely one-hundred percent sure on the serving of two consecutive terms&quot; was, specifically, that I think we should allow consecutive terms, because we don&#39;t have a megaton of steady regulars who are good at DA/Modding. But my priorities here were to get the word out.)<br><br>2) I swear with all my heart that this post is not a reflection on current Mods or Admins or DAs. You guys - all of you - have been doing a great job. It&#39;s just a way of putting the system up to support a population and community that has a lot of people coming and going - and, as pointed out down-thread, to avoid authority, both the good and bad sides, landing on anyone&#39;s shoulders alone, or for too long.<br><br>3) I&#39;m just going to answer questions in this post, if that&#39;s okay with everyone?<br><br>--DAs can kick &#39;regular&#39; members, but not mods. I see this as an issue, because sometimes Mods break the rules! It doesn&#39;t make them bad people, but it is a fact that should be acknowledged - I mean, we don&#39;t hold PGs up to be above thwappings.<br><br>--I would be in favor of doing elections now, since the equinox was last Saturday, and closing them this Saturday, or whatever. But I also wouldn&#39;t be opposed to waiting until Midwinter? Or whatever other dates people prefer?<br><br>--Oh dear Eru, please never use Moderator as a title while speaking to someone. I will hide under a rock and never ever come out.<br><br>--On DAs and Mods being unnecessary in simultaneous time, I actually kind of support having the roles separate - mods are sort of just there to solve problems of banishment, hard-authority (like, &quot;The consequences for what you just did, X, are Y days banned, and /ban&quot;). Also there&#39;s the fact that Mods are sort of Admin-y, and so expected to know how to operate an IRC channel, be able to sort of get technical errors, deal with the Bot, the channel, and so on - not something we expect DAs to have to do. So I&#39;m in favor of keeping them separate.<br><br>4) So, on to the questions, which should be voted on/discussed first, probably.<br><br>A: Are we in favor of elections?<br>B: How often, and when, to be held? (Including the first: now or later?)<br>C: How many DAs do we need? How many Mods? (are we keeping both positions?)<br>D: Do we give DAs a full star? (Is this possible?)<br>E: Are we allowing consecutive terms?<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure why consecutive terms would be a bad thing, except insofar as having non-consecutive terms might serve well to eliminate that sense of awe/wonder/terror that tends to accompany Authority Figures. All just folk, I think is the plan you&#39;re going for, yeah? Except DAs being folk with the power to tell people to shape up or ship out.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure where the power division is honestly. I thought DAs could kick, but I guess I haven&#39;t been in the IRC when kicking&#39;s become necessary? I do agree elections are good -- are we doing that now, then, or are you just bringing it up to remind people that it is a thing that should happen?<br><br>As to talking about harassment--<br>Someone else in the area suggested anonymity. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great idea, simply because of the lack of accountability -- if someone goes rogue, so to speak, no way to tell -- but at the same time, if it&#39;s people that have a long history around, there&#39;s intimidation factor etc. and I think talking to someone you know can be harder than someone faceless? So would have to figure a way to account for both of those.<br>But really, there should be some kind of way to get in touch, and, if there&#39;s any question, provide screenshots/logs...<br><br>I really don&#39;t know, but you have good ideas. :)</p>

            <p>On the DA/moderator issue, it seems that Elections would be an efficient method of ensuring someone doesn&#39;t get caught up in prejudicial ly banning or other hazards, and having the power in the first place is an excellent deterrent to possible trolls. <br>   On the subject of harassment, perhaps a private messaging system, or designated group of anonymous helpers would work? Such as people who volunteer to listen to problems cropping up, send an alert out, and keep an eye on the IRC and board perhaps? Just a thought.<br>    Finally, on Moderator vs moderator, I believe moderator would be the noun used in average speech; however, Moderator would refer to the moderator currently online or one you are talking to.</p>

            <p>I think this is very well thought out. I kind of like the bit about rotating through DAs and mods every few months and people not being able to serve consecutive terms. It really breaks up any potential issues of people thinking &quot;Oh those people are definitely in charge&quot; which is something I know VM, in particular, wishes to avoid. <br><br>In the case of the IRC, I think it is a very good idea. It avoids people looking at one or two people as the ultimate authority and takes some of the stress off people in those positions, because they won&#39;t have to take on the mindset and responsibility of being permanently &quot;in-charge&quot;. I think it will help bring folks more into the idea of being generally responsible and involved, also. If they know that the folks in those positions could be themselves in a few months, then I think it will encourage them to be more thoughtful and conscientious. <br><br>I was wondering one thing, though. If we have the DAs having equal power as the mods (and I think this is a good idea, so no one is above being told to behave when they need it), is it really necessary to have both? The DAs could have both powers of telling people to knock it off and banning if needed and I would be okay with that with this set up.</p>

            <p>I agree with everything here, including putting in place a system to get help with harassment if there isn&#39;t one already (and I don&#39;t think there is).

            <p>Yes, due to the continuing Liechtensteinian occupation of our former home, the entire (surviving) staff of <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/">that popular website</a> have moved here - to the new, shiny, up-to-date <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/index.htm">fanficWorld</a>! Over the next few decades we&#39;ll be rolling out categories for ALL your favourite fandoms, starting with the most popular of all... the PPC!<br><br>So come one, come all! Make your profiles! Post your stories! Review your peers! And remember, it&#39;s not the spelling that counts - it&#39;s the ideas!<br><br>~The fanficWorld Admin<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Or, in other words, and better-late-than-never... welcome to the PPC Badfic Contest 2012!<br><br>The rules... are simple. Forget everything you know about writing well - and then write a piece of PPC fanfiction. No Permission is required, and nothing that happens here is canonical. Oh, yes, and...<br><br>To be a fanwriter, you need to have a suitably fanthingish name. I&#39;m JayBird, which is a bit on the tame side, but a trawl through the fanficLand archives will reveal some of the examples we&#39;ve had before - and the types of stories they wrote, too.<br><br>Of course it&#39;s important to leave reviews for these stories - provided you do so in character. Again, check the back-catalogue for examples. And please remember - <b>none of this is real!</b> Flames are fine - they&#39;re encouraged - because it&#39;s not us doing (or getting!) the flames - its our fanthing other-selves, and they have no manners. ;)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>On the technical side, please please <i>please</i> give the following:<br><br>-An <b>author bio</b> when you write your first story. (This includes people who took part in previous versions - you can keep the name, but I do need a new bio).<br><br>-A suitably bad title for your story/ies. Chapter titles are good too.<br>-A genre or two.<br>-A rating (we use the G/PG/PG-13/R/M system).<br><br>-Website-related feedback. This thing didn&#39;t exist three days ago, so I&#39;m fully expecting bugs. This can be out-of-character.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>On that note, fanficWorld does use Javascript, so if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re out of luck. And, um, since I haven&#39;t said this - there&#39;s no way for anyone other than me to edit the site. <b>All posting should be done to the PPC Posting Board</b> - stories, bios, reviews, the lot. I&#39;ll get it on the website as and when I can (for archive purposes, basically).<br><br>hS<br><br><hr>
<br><hr>

I am not even kidding.  You have been warned.  -Phobos]]<br><br><br>Profile: Dystopian<em>Utopia is a fan writer in the PPC fandom.  He thinks the PPC fandom skews too sharply toward the &quot;shiny&quot;.  He is out to fix that.  He likes talking about himself in the third person.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Category: PPC<br>Inner Strength Chp 2<br>Genre: Horror/Tragedy<br>Rating: M<br>Summary: The continuing adventures of Ithalond as he exacts justice for the wrongs that have been done to him.<br><br>[[If you want to know where this came from, read the first one.  <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=213516;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Link</a>]]<br><br>Agent Suicide arrived in the Department of Fictional Psychology for his annual evaluation.  He walked through the mostly empty hallways looking for Jenni Robinson&#39;s office.  He really had begun enjoying these evaluations since she had taken him on.  He was looking forward to a chance at some alone time with Jenni, clinical though it may be.<br><br>As he approached the door to Jenni&#39;s office he could hear someone talking within.  She must still be with another patient.  Suicide knocked politely to announce his presence and waited for a response.  However, all the noise inside the office ceased at his knock and no reply was forthcoming.<br><br>Every warrior instinct that Suicide had was screaming that something was not right here.  He knew he should listen to those instincts, but his concern for Jenni drowned them out.  He threw open the door and stood in shock at the scene.<br><br>The room was dark, but the light through the open door illuminated Jenni Robinson in a spreading pool of her own crimson blood.  The blood was flowing from a large, ragged hole in her abdomen.  Suicide took a step and his foot impacted something small and wet.  It was Jenni&#39;s uterus.  Several other organs could be seen around the body, as if they had been discarded.<br><br>The Scythian warrior&#39;s own bloody past could not shield him from the sight of Jenni&#39;s mutilated corpse.  He had seen many gruesome wounds in his time on the battlefield, but those had been warriors.  They had been men who knew that they might be called at any time to lay down their life for their people.  The thought of anyone doing this to a woman, and a healer besides, was beyond imagining.  Suicide had to hold back the bile that was rising in his throat.  Someone was going to pay dearly for this.<br><br>He flicked out a hand to turn on the lights.  As his eyes adjusted he heard a whimper from the corner.  He turned and saw the cowering form of an elf, with silver hair, who was facing the wall.  The Scythian recognized his old partner, Ithalond.  That the Elf should be here did not surprise the Greek.  Ithalond was just as in need of Nurse Robinson&#39;s attention as anyone else.  Probably more than most.  Finding him cowering in the corner of a room full of blood was also not unexpected.  The Elf was known for his squeamishness.<br><br>As Suicide slowly approached the Elf alarm bells were ringing in his head.  He didn&#39;t hear them; his instincts were clouded by the loss of one friend and concern for another.<br><br>&quot;Ithalond, can you tell me what happened here?&quot;  No answer.  The warrior stepped closer.  &quot;Who did this?&quot;  Silence.  He was almost close enough to touch Ithalond&#39;s silver hair.  &quot;Damn it, Elf, answer me!&quot;<br><br>Suicide&#39;s anger broke through the fog and he realized how much he had missed.  Bloody footprints moving toward the light-switch.  Those same tracks leading to the Elf.  It didn&#39;t make any sense.  The Scythian&#39;s instincts screamed at him.  He jumped back just as Ithalond lashed out with one blood-covered, cybernetic hand.  Had he been any slower, the Elf would have shattered his knee cap.<br><br>--<br><br>Ithalond growled deep in his throat when Suicide avoided his surprise attack.  Fate had delivered one of those who had tormented him for so long and Ithalond would make sure that he did not waste this chance.  The Scythian must be made to pay for every moment of Ithalond&#39;s prolonged pain.<br><br>The Elf rose gracefully from the floor, and smiled at his &quot;old friend&quot;.  It would have been a warm smile, if not for the cold malevolence radiating from his eyes and the gore dripping from his cybernetic hands.<br><br>&quot;Suicide,&quot; said the Elf, &quot;how good of you to join us.  Jenni and I were just exploring her inner strength.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you lost your mind, Ithalond?  Why would you do this?&quot;  The Scythian was on his guard now.  The Elf was no warrior, so Suicide should be able to subdue him with little problem, but something behind Ithalond&#39;s voice worried him.  There was an edge of cold steel hidden behind the fake warmth of the Elf&#39;s speech.<br><br>&quot;Why would I do it?&quot; spat the Elf, the chilling edge in his voice sliding closer to the surface.  He circled his sometimes partner with a maniacal gleam in his eye.  &quot;She helped them keep me alive after the loss of my hands and the terrible that I was forced to endure.  You, my <i>friend,</i> are guilty of that and more.&quot;  He snarled and lept at Suicide.<br><br>The Scythian was prepared this time.  He turned aside the Elf&#39;s cybernetic claw with his own augmented hand and brought his leg around to take Ithalond down quickly.  <br><br>But Suicide was not as nimble as he once was.  Ithalond dipped down and caught Suicide&#39;s foot with his other hand.  There was a sickening crunch and the ancient warrior screamed.<br><br>Suicide was not going to let this terrible pain to stop him from avenging his love.  He brought his elbow down on the side of the Elf&#39;s head.  Ithalond gave a shout and let go of Suicide&#39;s foot.  Blood began to stream from the wound.<br>&quot;I am going to kill you for what you&#39;ve done, Ithalond,&quot; the Scythian promised.  &quot;I will deliver you, personally, to the ferryman!&quot;  He kept his weight off of his crushed foot and lashed out with his augmented hand.<br><br>Ithalond darted back with a rabid smile.  He knew that Suicide&#39;s mobility was severely hampered.  The Elf could take his time and make this last.<br><br>&quot;Suicide,&quot; taunted Ithalond.  &quot;I have so much to thank you for.&quot;  He gave a feint to get Suicide&#39;s cybernetic hand to move to block.  When it did, the Elf spun and his own mechanical appendage slammed into Suicide&#39;s forearm.  There was a sound like a tree branch breaking in a high wind.  Ithalond danced back and Suicide did everything he could to remain conscious as blood ran from where his bones protruded from his forearm.<br><br>&quot;That was for the constant hectoring.&quot; explained the Elf.  His voice was entirely edge, now.  &quot;And this, is for the Dibbler pie.&quot;  Ithalond brought his hands down onto Suicide&#39;s shoulder and his upper arm.  Suicide tried to fight the Elf&#39;s metal grip, but even the old strength of his muscles failed as Ithalond ripped the Scythian&#39;s arm from its socket and completely off of his body.<br><br>Suicide would have wailed had he not been so far into shock.  He was barely staying upright as Ithalond moved around behind him.<br><br>&quot;Oh, Suicide, how the mighty have fallen.  But don&#39;t worry <i>old friend</i>, I&#39;ve learned the lessons you tried to teach me.&quot;  He dug his cybernetic fingers into the flesh of Suicides back.  &quot;After all, you&#39;ve always said I should get some backbone.&quot;  He tensed his muscles, servos in his hands whined and he removed Suicide&#39;s spine.  The Scythian fell, lifeless, next to his love.<br><br>Ithalond tossed the spinal cord onto Jenni&#39;s couch and stood for a moment in the silence.  His hands twitched and dripped gore.  His breathing was ragged and there was a hint of maniacal laughter.<br><br>The Elf moved suddenly.  He paced through the pool of combined blood from the now deceased lovers.  &quot;Why should they be the only one&#39;s to pay?&quot;  He stalked out of the office and into the halls of Headquarters.<br><br>A/N: I don&#39;t really care if you review or not.

            <p>A/N: Well that worekd well i tihnk! Tahnks for all teh revies. Umm thi chapterr is an esperment in ACTIOM. <br><br>*<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**_* <br><br>In an instant, the attack began. Jaycacia had only just enough time to see the enemies&#39; flash patches - the Black Sage Frond, emblem of Intel&#39;s ultra-secret Dark Division - before she was caught up in a fight for her life. Her powers were ineffective against her fellow PPCers - she could only have removed <i>them</i> from the story by also removing <i>herself</i> - but it was not for nothing that she had spent years training against Agents Dafydd, Suicide and Tawaki - simultaneously. Jaycacia&#39;s hands blurred...<br><br>Thirty seconds later it was over. None of the Intel Agents had gotten anywhere near Jay and the Sunflower Official - and none of them had gotten away. Jaycacia was breathing heavily, but her only wound was a small scratch on her forehead. She breathed a sigh of relief and turned to go to her lovers - she needed someone to wash the blood off, after all - when SOMETHING snaked out of the bushes and wrapped around her ankle!<br><br>Jaycacia fought against the dark tendril as it pulled her towards the forest. Jay and the SO ran towards her, but, &quot;Stay back!&quot; she cried. &quot;There&#39;s no reason for you to put yourselves in danger!&quot;<br><br><i>Don&#39;t be so confident,</i> a dark voice cackled, and from the bushes rose...<br><br>THE SUB ROSA!<br><br><i>You!</i> cried the SO. <i>You were on our side!</i><br><br><i>That&#39;s what you were supposed to think!</i> the Sub Rosa sneered. <i>Acacia told me all about how disgusting your precious Jaycacia is - how weak she is. And </i>this<i> is the so-called best agent in the PPC? Ridiculous! I will kill her - and when the agents see how pitiful she is, why, they will renounce </i>you<i>, and I will rule unchallenged!</i><br><br>&quot;Not while I still draw breath!&quot; Jaycacia snapped, and used the powers given to her by an ancient daffodil to conjure a sword - and sliced through the tendril that held her!<br><br>The Sub Rosa let out a mental scream and flinched away. <i>You may have won this time,</i> it said, <i>but when you return to HQ I will be waiting - and I will destroy you!</i> Then it leapt into a red and black portal that looked like a bleeding wound into the heart of the world and was gone.<br><br>Jay and the SO rushed to Jaycacia&#39;s side. &quot;Oh my dearest darling daughter!&quot; Jay exclaimed. &quot;I was so worried about you! I thought those nasty people were going to hurt you and leave me all alone! Are you all right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;For now,&quot; Jaycacia said quietly, her voice ominous. &quot;But if the Sub Rosa gets her hands on me again, I won&#39;t be. I need to be stronger.&quot; She looked hard at the SO, and he sighed.<br><br><i>All right,</i> the SO said sadly. <i>I know what you are thinking of. I will speak to the Board at once.</i><br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;Have you noticed,&quot; Jay mused from her place on the couch, &quot;how disturbingly good her spelling is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Acacia swallowed another date and tilted her head. &quot;An interesting point. May I counter?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, by all means,&quot; Jay said graciously. &quot;It&#39;s a free country, after all - provided you&#39;re not a soldier, foreigner, plebian or slave.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or a woman,&quot; Acacia added. Jay shrugged.<br><br>&quot;Well, at least it&#39;s a free country for the Emperor. You were saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was saying,&quot; Acacia resumed, &quot;have </i>you<i> noticed how disturbingly bad her </i>plots<i> are?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; Jay considered the olive between her fingers, and shrugged. &quot;There is that.&quot;</i><br><br>((OOC: As of right now, all stories and authors are uploaded. Reviews are in a sort of some-are-some-aren&#39;t state: some are, some aren&#39;t. :P And I know I haven&#39;t been doing much reviewing, but I&#39;d like to say in passing that you are all HILARIOUS.

            <p>A/N: Ummm so tahnks for the reviews!! Tihs chaptre is quiet a log one so i hop you liek it!<br><br>*<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>*<br><br>Jaycacia Thornbyrd stood in the Committee Room and breathed deeply. &quot;All right,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot; <br><br><i>Do you truly understand what is asked of you?</i> a mental voice said out of the darkness. <br><br>&quot;I do,&quot; Jaycacia replied. &quot;The survival of the entire PPC rests on my actions here and now - on my sacrifice.&quot; <br><br><i>There will be no going back</i>, another voice told her. <i>Once you do this, you will never be able to return to who you were.</i> <br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; Jaycacia affirmed. &quot;But if I stop now, what life I have will be one of misery and suffering under a cruel master.&quot; <br><br><i>It will be incredibly painful</i>, a third voice said gently, <i>both during and after the transformation.</i><br><br>Jaycacia smiled grimly. &quot;Death is more painful,&quot; she said. &quot;Death is forever.&quot; <br><br><i>Then so be it</i>, a fourth voice said, one she knew very well. <i>Beloved, your sacrifice will be remembered.</i><br><br>&quot;I know, husband mine,&quot; Jaycacia told the Sunflower Official. &quot;Thank you.&quot; <br><br><i>Let us begin</i>, a fifth voice said with grim finality. <i>Please enter the circle, and prepare yourself.</i><br><br><i>At least, as much as that&#39;s possible,</i> said the second voice quietly. Jaycacia took a deep breath, gave a small smile, and stepped forward.<br><br>The assembled Board of Department Heads (less the Sub Rosa, of course, and Doctor Fitzgerald, who as a human didn&#39;t have any of the powers the Flowers possess, and the Clover, who had been tragically killed in what Jaycacia now realised was the Sub Rosa&#39;s first sneak attack) closed the circle, twining their tendrils together. As Jaycacia closed her eyes they began to hum softly, the first &#39;real&#39; sound they had ever made. A soft, shimmering light began to glow above the circle, shifting through the spectrum before finally settling on a combination of soft pink and vivid orange.<br><br><i>Power of the Origin, be upon us,</i> said the deep, slow voice of Hornbeam - the first voice.<br><br><i>Grant us Your strength, that we may grant it onwards,</i> intoned the Floating Hyacinth - the second voice.<br><br><i>Let fire and water, earth and air, bend to the will of this Chosen One,</i> the Tiger Lily spoke - the third voice.<br><br><i>Let her light be a beacon in the darkness that engulfs us,</i> came a new voice - the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace.<br><br><i>Let her enemies burn,</i> said the Marquis de Sod simply - the fifth voice.<br><br><i>Jaycacia Thornbyrd,</i> said the SO with a quaver in his voice, <i>you have been Chosen. Will you receive this power?</i><br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Jaycacia whispered, and the humming rose to a fever pitch.<br><br><i>I ask a second time,</i> the SO said. <i>The power is yours, if you take it. Will you?</i><br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Jaycacia said, her voice strong. The light above the circle blazed now, brighter than the sun.<br><br><i>One last time for all,</i> the Sunflower Official declared. <i>Jaycacia, will you take up this power?</i><br><br>&quot;Yes!&quot; cried Jaycacia Thornbyrd. &quot;For all the PPC, I will!&quot;<br><br><i>Then so be it!</i> declared the Flowers as one, and their combined power flung itself into Jaycacia, who...<br><br>... didn&#39;t even scream, though her eyes blazed with agony. The coruscating light flooded into her, filling her - transforming her. Her golden hair flew out from her head and kept going, becoming a radiant orb of brilliance. The blue fire in her eyes blazed ever hotter, spreading to consume her face - or rather to glorify it.<br><br>Even as her lissom limbs moulded themselves to her sides, stunning silver leaves grew from what had once been her hands. Her toes spread across the floor, becoming graceful roots - and then the power pouring into her lessened to a mere torrent, then a river, and finally a simple, trickling stream before it stopped.<br><br>The Board of Flowers looked upon their work in awe. <i>The Starflower,</i> the Floating Hyacinth whispered. <i>Even now, I can barely believe it.</i><br><br><i>Believe,</i> said the Sunflower Official simply, and stepped forward, one leaf extended. <i>Oh Chosen One,</i> he said, bowing his blossom, <i>radiant Starflower, we beseech your aid in this time of our most desperate need.</i> Around the circle, the other Flowers bowed, each in their own way. The Starflower watched them calmly, and then...<br><br>... laughed, a high, pure laugh. <i>Oh, husband,</i> she said, in velvet tones of sheer pleasure, <i>why so solemn? I&#39;m still me - still Jaycacia - just... better.</i><br><br>~<br><br><i>Acacia snorted, prompting Jay to break off her contemplation of the mosaic floor. &quot;Something&#39;s funny? Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not funny so much as tragic,&quot; Acacia replied, waving the sheet of paper. &quot;Miss Jaycacia has decided she&#39;d be better off as a Flower.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Clearly she&#39;s never met any Flowers,&quot; Jay murmured. &quot;The idea </i>is<i> pretty amusing, I&#39;ll give you that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not so much that,&quot; Acacia said, scanning the page again. &quot;It&#39;s just... like you said, she&#39;s got decent spelling - even with the long words most Sues wouldn&#39;t even know existed - and she&#39;s clearly </i>trying<i>, but...&quot;<br><br>&quot;But the harder she tries, the more she fails,&quot; Jay agreed. &quot;It is a bit tragic - but still hilarious.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, well, obviously,&quot; Acacia said, throwing a date at her friend. &quot;I figured </i>that<i> went without saying.&quot;</i><br><br>((OOC: Good grief I might even finish this))</p>

            <p>A/N: Ummm so tihs chapter is a littl bit VYOLENT. Umm i would put teh rating up if I coudl I think...<br><br>The Flowers of the Board crowded round their saviour - and that was when the wall exploded and black-clad figures swarmed through. At their head was a black woman with vicious blue eyes.<br><br>&quot;Architeuthis?&quot; Jay said, coming forward in bewilderment. &quot;What are you doing here? Are you here to worship the Starflower too?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Worship?&quot; Architeuthis snapped. &quot;<i>That</i>?&quot; She spat on the floor. &quot;I&#39;m here to kill it - and all of you, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kill... me?&quot; Jay breathed, blinking rapidly. &quot;But Archy - I thought you were my friend!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I worked very hard to keep you thinking that way,&quot; Architeuthis growled. &quot;By the dark gods of all the worlds! The number of times I wanted to just <i>rip</i> your heart out...&quot; She grinned, her teeth gleaming in the light of the Starflower&#39;s blossom. &quot;Guess I get my chance after all.&quot; She pulled out a knife and started to advance.<br><br><i>NO!</i> bellowed Jaycacia, the Starflower, and a wall of fire leapt up between the evil Spy and her prey. The Board Flowers fell to the ground before the ferocious heat, but Jaycacia never quailed. <i>You will not harm my faithful!</i> she went on. <i>Leave now!</i><br><br>&quot;Not going to happen, you little weed,&quot; Architeuthis snarled. &quot;All right, guys and girls - get them.&quot;<br><br>Jaycacia threw up a second firewall, but the two monsters with the Spies - Kyaris the hydra and Voltarmi the dragon - acted as bridges for the others. Gliding between her mother and the attackers, Jaycacia launched her offensive.<br><br>The first fireball took Bulldog full in the chest, throwing him back in an inferno that engulfed the white-coated shape of Keily Shinra too. Angus MacFarlane leapt over them and swung his lightsaber, and Jaycacia cried out in horror as he cut straight through Hornbeam&#39;s trunk before her fireball reached him. The Spy burned with the Ironwood, both of them screaming.<br><br>There was a loud whinnying sound, and the murderous shape of Snapshot - a unicorn who seemed to be more than half rhinoceros - reared up over the prone form of the Marquis de Sod, her hooves primed to smash him to compost - but Jaycacia was faster. The unicorn&#39;s neck snapped back, faster than she could act - but not faster than thought. Her cruel horn blazed with black lightning even as she died, and the Marquis was flung across the floor - straight into the walls of fire. The Daisy burnt like a torch... but even in his agony, he managed to intercept the charging form of Tourmaline, taking her with him into the fire.<br><br>The remaining Flowers, led by the Sunflower Official - Jaycacia&#39;s heart swelled to see her beloved being so brave - fought back against the tide. The Queen Anne&#39;s Lace spread herself wide, catching the goose Monty and his pigeon thanes and crushing the life out of them. The Floating Hyacinth threw himself at Nasir, pushing the Spy back into the path of one of his own colleagues&#39; knives - but was forced to retreat when the mouse Ceepileet slashed away half of his blossom. The SO finished the mouse off, but the damage was done - the defence&#39;s lines were broken.<br><br>Jaycacia turned from her victory over Kyaris and Voltarmi, both now nothing more than scorched skeletons, to see Amber Dashel and Gaspard De Grasse lunge through and stab the brave Queen Anne&#39;s Lace in the back. She exclaimed in horror, sending forth a fire-blast which consumed them both - but it was too late to save the Flower.<br><br>The battle was almost over, with only a few of the Spies left standing. Jaycacia watched - holding back her powers for fear of hurting her husband - as the Sunflower Official threw Gauri Narain across the room. The Spy flew past where Architeuthis stood, watching the fight with a cold expression, and hit the wall hard enough that her spine snapped - and then there was an explosion, and a cut-off scream, and Jaycacia felt utter dread in her heart.<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;... whoa.&quot; Jay leant back against the side of the tepidarium, staring at her friend. &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s the same author?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She certainly has gotten a lot more vicious,&quot; Acacia agreed, folding the sheet of paper and placing it on the floor by the pool. &quot;Can&#39;t say it&#39;s an improvement.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, no,&quot; Jay agreed. &quot;And she&#39;s clearly never been in a real fight.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or met any Spies,&quot; Acacia said with a grin. &quot;Seriously, can you picture how that would actually have gone?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can, and it&#39;s not pretty,&quot; Jay murmured. &quot;Still... maybe it&#39;s a good thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot; The woman nodded solemnly. &quot;Can you imagine the trouble she&#39;d cause if she was </i>well<i>-written?&quot;<br><br>There was a brief pause.<br><br>&quot;Yes. I can. And it&#39;s not-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, hush.&quot;</i></p>

            <p>A/N: So this is ITTT! Teh end! Tahnks to al my loyla readres and everone who has enjoyed SWEAT, BLOOD AND TEARS.<br><br>Jaycacia the Staflower turned slowly to face the rear wall of the room - or rather, what had been the rear wall, but was now a pile of rubble, slowly settling around the dark form of the Sub Rosa. <i>Well, well,</i> said the evil Head of Intelligence. <i>I believe this is what they call an opportunity.</i><br><br><i>Only an opportunity to perish,</i> the Sunflower Official said defiantly - and then stiffened as the Tiger Lily, unnoticed until now amid the commotion, touched a leaf to his blossom.<br><br><i>I have him, ma&#39;am,</i> she said, nodding to the Sub Rosa. <i>And the Hyacinth, crippled though it is.</i><br><br><i>Excellent,</i> the Sub Rosa said. <i>They will make the most perfect toys.</i><br><br><i>No!</i> the SO bellowed - but he could not move. It was as if invisible chains bound him to the spot. The Sub Rosa chuckled as Architeuthis and the traitorous Tiger Lily joined her.<br><br><i>As if I would let you go free after this defiance,</i> she said scathingly. <i>You should have pledged yourself to me voluntarily, Sunflower.</i><br><br>&quot;No... true PPCer... ever would,&quot; said a weak voice, and Jay Thorntree elbowed her way out of the rubble to stand, defiant, before the Sub Rosa. The Flower almost seemed to flinch back at the sight of her.<br><br><i>The Assassin?</i> she asked. <i>But what can you hope to achieve? You are weak!</i><br><br>&quot;I may be weak and pathetic,&quot; Jay said, &quot;and I know I&#39;m not all that bright - but I won&#39;t let you take over the PPC. If you want HQ, you&#39;ll have to go through me.&quot;<br><br><i>Oh, is that all?</i> the Sub Rosa sniffed. Her vines flashed out, throwing Jay to the ground - and that was enough to break through the Starflower&#39;s shocked paralysis.<br><br>Jaycacia ducked beneath the Sub Rosa&#39;s swinging tendrils and dove towards her mother&#39;s crumpled form. <i>Husband!</i> she cried using the psychic voice she got when she became a Flower. <i>Help me!</i><br><br>The Sunflower Official strained against his bonds, but could not move. <i>I&#39;m doing all I can, Jaycacia my love!</i> he called. The Sub Rosa laughed a deep, booming laugh. <br><br><i>You cannot defeat me, child,</i> she said. <i>I control your father&#39;s soul, and that means -- I control YOU!</i><br><br><i>There is only one way to control someone&#39;s soul,</i> Jaycacia told her firmly, <i>and that is love.</i><br><br>The Sub Rosa&#39;s laugh echoed from the ceiling, joined by those of her subordinates. <i>Love? What good is love? Can it save you from my inevitable victory?</i> Her tendrils whipped at Jaycacia, slid away, and came back to cling, pulling her in. The Starflower struggled - but perhaps not as hard as she might.<br><br><i>Saving me isn&#39;t the plan,</i> Jaycacia said as her enemy drew her close. <i>It never was.</i><br><br><i>Jaycacia! No!</i> the SO cried, realising in anguish what she was about to do. Jaycacia closed her mental ears to his pleas.<br><br><i>You forget who I am - </i>what<i> I am,</i> she said, quietly but in a voice that filled the room. <i>I am no ordinary Flower, Sub Rosa - I am the Starflower. I have the Power of Origin - and that power is drawn from the very dawn of time.</i><br><br>&quot;She&#39;s stalling,&quot; Architeuthis hissed. &quot;Just kill her and get it over with.&quot;<br><br><i>This isn&#39;t a stall - it&#39;s an explanation,</i> Jaycacia snapped. <i>The beginning of the multiverse, when the very fabric of space and time burnt so bright a star would be like midnight. That is where my power comes from - and I can send it back.</i><br><br><i>Sending us along with it, I suppose?</i> the Tiger Lily mused. <i>Don&#39;t think us naive, Jaycacia. I know enough to know that the Starflower can never be separated from her powers. You would go with us - and you too would die.</i><br><br><i>But that&#39;s the thing,</i> Jaycacia announced, throwing her tendrils wide and siezing the three Spies before they could flee. <i>I am filled with love,</i> she said, <i>and what greater love can there be - than to lay down my life for those I cherish? Goodbye, husband - I love you.</i> And with those words, the power of the Starflower blazed hotter than ever before, engulfing her and the three Spies. When it faded, all trace of Jaycacia Thornbyrd was gone.<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>E<br>N<br>D<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;... she actually finished it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Looks like.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.

            <p>A small crowd of Spies congregated around Gaspard’s computer in the Sorting Room.<br><br>They had been watching the development of Jaycacia’s newest adventure with interest ever since the appearance of the badfic!DoI’s Dark Division. The newest chapter had come out and the crowd was reading up on the slaughter of their badfic selves.<br><br>“Great Scott,” mumbled Gaspard, scrolling down the page. “It’s a bloody massacre. Does this author even know how the DoI operates, or what its agents do? We pull surveillance for Glod’s sake, not assassinations.”<br><br>“Yes, but that sort of explains why we all died,” said Nasir. “To be fair, ‘we’ did put a dent in the Board of Department Heads.”<br><br>There was a chorus of muttered agreement and chuckles behind him. <br><br>“Yeah. Says here that Gus killed the Hornbeam with a lightsaber,” said Bulldog, pointing at the relevant passage.<br><br>“Yew kiddin’? The man’s so fat and out of shape he was mistaken fer Sergeant Colon last week!” said someone in the back.<br><br>“I heard that, Yakov!”<br><br>“Ouch. Hey Bulldog, you’re the first casualty.”<br><br>“Ooh, nice work with the Marquis, Snapshot.”<br><br>“Ha! You got owned by the Hyacinth, Nasir.”<br><br>“Oh, come on, I would have at least brought Juliane with me,” replied the Arabic man, holding up his Glaceon. “Ice deals double damage versus grass. And why were we all armed with knives? Surely some of us would have brought a flamethrower? Or a firearm?”<br><br>“Screw logic. Jaycacia will probably revive all of the dead Flowers by sobbing over their ashes,” said Angus.<br><br>“Yes, quite.”<br><br>“Hey, Gaspard helped take down the Queen Anne’s Lace!”<br><br>The junior agent snorted. “Yeah, fat chance. In reality, I would have stayed out of that mess.”<br><br>Somebody make clucking sounds nearby.<br><br>“Hey, he who runs away lives to fight another day,” said Gaspard.<br><br>“Yeah, but in your case you’d keep on running,” said Angus, giving the Spy a friendly nudge in the ribs.<br><br>“Point taken, sir. I’ll have you know it works for the Doctor, though.”<br><br>Bulldog glanced at his wristwatch. “Okay people, back to work! We’ve still got three hours left on this shift! You can read up on it once you’ve punched out and gone home.”<br><br>- -<br><i> I couldn&#39;t resist.<br><br>SeaTurtle</i></p>

            <p><b>Chapter Seven</b><br><br>The replaced canons are easily disposed of. The Mary Sue is thrown into the Cracks of Doom. After extensive Neuralysis the canon carries on as usual, as John takes one last photograph of Rivendell before opening a portal back home.<br><br>“You lied to me, by the way,” he points out as they enter their Response Centre once more. “You did know her name and her appearance. You just couldn’t say it.”<br><br>Sherlock raises an eyebrow but says nothing, crossing over to the console to send a message – ostensibly to his brother in Personnel. John sighs, and flops down onto his bed. <br><br>“You’re not going to admit it, are you?” he asks Sherlock.<br><br>“Admit what?”<br><br>“That you lied to me, and that you were wrong.”<br><br>“Wrong how?” asks Sherlock.<br><br>“You did know about the Sue, but not how her message should be interpreted.”<br><br>“I knew her name.” Sherlock replies vaguely.<br><br>“And you couldn’t tell me because?”<br><br>“She went into hiding by removing her name from the text and forcing everyone to forget she ever entered their world. She also made it hard to tamper with the Words. She knew about us, and so she thought the best way out would be to forget her own existence.”<br><br>John ponders it for a moment. “Okay, even if that’s true… how many Sues are going to readily forget themselves?”<br><br>“Those who want to escape the PPC,” suggests Sherlock, rolling his eyes.”Obviously.”<br><br>John purses his lips. “I suppose. And who is theimprobableone?”<br><br>“None of my business,” replies Sherlock, shrugging.<br><br>“You called him a consulting Suethor.”<br><br>“That’s what he is.” Sherlock shrugs again. “It truly isn’t any of your business.”<br><br>John sighs. “Fine, your funeral. But before the console beeps for another mission, we should celebrate our first at the Cafeteria. Drinks are on me!”<br><br>“Excellent! You can always tell a good bottle of Bleepka by the shape of the cap. And I can always predict the snarky quotes underneath them.”<br><br>“No, you can’t.” But John’s already at the door to the RC, opening it, grinning widely. <br><br>Sherlock smirks, as if in challenge, and dons his scarf once more. “Challenge accepted.”<br><br>And as they leave, the console beeps once more. A Protector’s job is never done.<br><br><b>END.</b><br><br>((Aaaand that&#39;s it. Perhaps if I stay around in the Sherlock fandom long enough I&#39;ll write a sequel for next year or something. I dunno. Or maybe the sequel will happen sooner because this is actually fun and I like writing Sherlock AUs.<br>Sorry about the elements of PPC continuity that were distorted, like them not knowing the Sue&#39;s name before the mission and treating the entire thing like a casefic and a rather shitty casefic at that (pretty sure I&#39;ve written better). I might play around with this and polish it up sometime. Woot.))<br></p>

            <p><b>Chapter Six</b><br><br>His heart pounding wildly in his chest, John rushes on through the woods in pursuit of Sherlock. The leaves in this part of the forest certainly look treaded-on, so he follows their paths, hoping against hope that Sherlock has caught, charged, and killed the Sue already.<br><br>Just as he stops to take a quick breath, he hears voices through the trees.<br><br>“How did you guess that?” a female voice asks, clearly amused. There’s a pause, and then Sherlock responds in kind.<br><br>“The message.”<br><br>“Ah, so your partner <i>was</i> right.”<br><br>“I was right, too. You did want revenge, in some way.”<br><br>“But it was also part of my name. Rachewen, maiden of the West.” The woman’s voice has a distinctive lilt. “It’s certainly nice to see you again.”<br><br>Sherlock either says something far too quiet, or nothing at all. John’s not sure what; he strains to hear them without being seen himself; he can barely make out their forms in the clearing ahead. <br><br>“Have you been enjoying the puzzle I set out for you?” Rachewen asks, and John can almost see the grin on her face. “Of course, I’d have kept myself the way I was, but he insisted.”<br><br>“He?” echoes Sherlock.<br><br>“Theimprobableone,” replies Rachewen, obviously attempting to sound mysterious.<br><br>“The consulting Suethor,” agrees Sherlock, his voice resigned. “He has <i>far</i> too much time on his hands, doesn’t he?”<br><br>John strains even more to hear the conversation; slowly he creeps forward, towards their clearing. He notches an arrow to the bowstring, breath baited with anticipation. Within the clearing sits Sherlock and Rachewen the Sue; a stone separates them, and on the stone sits two goblets, obviously elvish-wrought with inlays of alabaster and mother-of-pearl.<br><br>“Ah, I see,” Sherlock says, the boredom still evident in his words. “That would explain why I couldn’t remember your name or your appearance, and why your friend Celeste couldn’t do the same, either.”<br><br>“Just so. Are you ready to play?” asks the Sue.<br><br>“Two goblets of wine. Explain.”<br><br>“One of them is poisoned.”<br><br>“No, both of them are, but you have a natural immunity to the poison used,” retorts Sherlock.<br><br>“I swear that I don’t.”<br><br>“You’re Vala. How do I trust that?”<br><br>“The ring. I concentrated all of my immorality, all of my power into that ring.” John peers into the clearing, sees the Sue staring longingly at the ring that Sherlock is twiddling. “Without that ring, I am as mortal as you.”<br><br>“Ah, a <i>deus ex machina</i>. Of course.” Sherlock laughs harshly, putting the ring away and looking ready to stand up.<br>“Don’t chicken out on me,” sneers the Sue. Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Play the game, or are you too <i>scared</i> to lose?”<br><br>“I don’t have to play. You aren’t obliging me in any way.”<br><br>“You know, theimprobableone told me so many things about my kind. Said we had this special… aura… that we could use to coerce people into doing our will. Neat, isn’t it?”<br><br>“The Aura of Smooth. Yes. I’m aware of that – that’s how you character-replaced those canons.”<br><br>“You wouldn’t like it very much if I used it on you, no?”<br>“Obviously not, but you won’t use it.”<br><br>Rachewen raises an eyebrow. “No?”<br><br>“No, because then it wouldn’t be fair, and you wouldn’t derive any sort of satisfaction from beating me.”<br><br>“Mary Sues never play fair.”<br><br>“Excellent point, but now that you’ve been made aware of your situation, you –”<br><br>At that moment, the Sue pounces across the rock, latching herself onto the surprised younger Agent, her hands at his throat and her lips on his. Sherlock falls back, flailing wildly, and John’s heart nearly leaps into his throat.<br><br>“SHERLOCK!” he shouts, and the rest is a blur of red in his eyes. It’s only after the arrow has sailed through the air and lodged firmly in the back of the Mary Sue that John even realises that she’d been shot.<br><br>Sherlock clambers to his feet, leaves tangled in his hair and eyes wide with shock. John walks closer to his new partner, noticing the bruises from the Sue’s fingertips around his neck, bruises from the Sue’s kiss on his lips.<br><br>“Are you all right?” he asks Sherlock, who turns back and looks at the whimpering, dying Sue, an eyebrow raised.<br><br>“You just killed her,” he says.<br><br>John feels like laughing. “Well, you know, I’m an Assassin. That’s kinda what I do.”<br><br>“Nice shot.”<br><br>“Thank you.”<br><br>“You found the canons?”<br><br>“I let them out of the plothole, yes. They should be back at the Council. Not sure if they did anything to their impostors, though.” John purses his lips. “We ought to charge Rachewen and dispose of her before we take care of that, though.”<br><br>“Fair enough.” Sherlock nods, and John walks over to the Sue, kicking her over so that she is facing them. She winces, horror quite literally etched all over her face. It looks rather painful.<br><br>“Rachewen, you are hereby charged with: being a Mary Sue, replacing the characters of Legolas Thranduillion and Frodo Baggins, aiding and abetting subordinate Sues, screwing with the appearance of Rivendell, being the daughter of Manwë and Varda, using an <i>deus ex machina</i> Extra Ring of Power, screwing with numerology, creating mini-Balrogs Bruien, Elrod, and Aragon, and screwing with your own fic in order to hide from justice. For that, you are sentenced to death. Any last words?”<br><br>“He’s after you, Agent Holmes. He won’t stop!” cries Rachewen as John shoots another arrow into her heart.<br><br>Sherlock only raises an eyebrow, taking a step back and observing her corpse with distaste.<br></p>

            <p><b>Chapter Five</b><br><br>“She’s not going to be at the Council. She’s going to be looking for her ring.”<br><br>John rolls his eyes and pulls out a book of crosswords. Sherlock looks over his shoulder.<br><br>“That’s not how you spell ‘antidisestablishmentarianism’,” he snaps. <br><br>“You’re certainly very cheerful,” John mutters, erasing what he’s already written. “Anything else you’d care to add?”<br><br>Sherlock rolls his eyes. “She’s not going to join the Fellowship. She’s not at the Council.”<br><br>“She could make a sudden dramatic entrance,” John points out. <br><br>“She’s in hiding. If she wants to avoid our attentions, she’d avoid the Council.”<br><br>“Doesn’t that mean we’ll have to find her?”<br><br>“I said she was looking for her ring.” Sherlock rolls his eyes, clambers to his feet. Silently, they head away from the patio where the Council is being held; slowly, they tiptoe away from the canonicals all arranged around the Ring. Lord Elrond is sobbing something about his missing daughter (John opened a portal to Shelob’s lair under her corpse); Legolas and Aragorn are saying something about using the power of friendship to destroy the Ring. Frodo is, for lack of a better word, tripping out. The Suefluence can be very psychedelic sometimes.<br><br>They finally come back to the small bridge on which the message had been scrawled. The message lies there no more, however, and there is a dark figure scrabbling in the brush nearby. In the bushes, Sherlock tenses. John readies his bow for firing.<br><br>The figure looks up; for a moment they see a flash of violet eyes and strawberry blonde hair before the figure gets to her feet and runs away, disappearing into the woods. <br><br>“After her!” Sherlock shouts, and John has no choice but to follow his clearly insane partner into the woods, after a Vala Sue who has, up until now, been in hiding from her own story.<br><br>It’s exhilarating, chasing down this Sue with Sherlock. His feet seem to barely touch the ground and the chase is thrilling – Sherlock sprints on ahead and he follows effortlessly, and when they stop so Sherlock can read the tracks on the leaf-strewn floor, John realises that his leg isn’t paining him anymore.<br><br>Sherlock straightens up and beams at him. “Knew you had it in you, John. Come on!”<br><br>Onwards they run, through the flickering lines of trees, through the alternating patterns of shadow and light. It is high noon in Rivendell, for some reason. The Sue is ahead, and John has never felt this alive before.<br><br>He’s about to tell Sherlock this, but suddenly that tree is far too close and –<br><br>THUNK.<br><br>“Ai!”<br><br>John leaps away, wide-eyed. Up ahead, he hears Sherlock rushing onwards. But for the moment he stares, dumbfounded, at the ellon he has run into. <br><br>Legolas Thranduillion stares back, brows furrowed. “Who are you?” he demands.<br><br>“Um.” John smiles shakily, taking a step back. “I come in pursuit of Enemy spies,” he bluffs. <br><br>The man next to Legolas – Aragorn – gets to his feet with knife drawn. “A likely story,” he growls. <br><br>“Peace, Strider,” a third voice intones. Frodo Baggins steps out. “Strider, he clearly isn’t either of <i>them</i>.”<br><br>“These woods have not been plagued with the spies of Sauron for ages,” Aragorn hissed. “Isn’t that so, my lord?”<br><br>Sitting on a convenient log, Lord Elrond looks over at John with a raised eyebrow. “His story may be false, but it has one grain of truth,” the elf lord says after a moment. “He is chasing <i>them</i>.”<br><br>Frodo nods. Legolas and Aragorn continue to stare warily at John even as they put their weapons away. <br><br>“Has she passed by?” John asks, noticing the tell-tale shimmer of the plothole that surrounds them.<br><br>“Not too long ago. She should be nearing the edges of this valley if she can truly run as the crow flies,” Legolas muses. <br><br>“What direction?” John asks. He sneaks a look down at his left hand, so often left trembling from his shoulder wound. It is perfectly steady now. He takes a deep breath.<br><br>Aragorn helpfully points. “East,” he explains. <br><br>Frodo pipes up again. “Would it trouble you too much to free us from this?” he asks, gesturing to the faint shimmery haze of the plothole’s boundaries. “After all, if you aim to slay her, then this space may cease to exist very soon.”<br><br>John blinks, and then fumbles in his bag for the Remote Activator. He opens a portal to let them out of the plothole, before jumping through it himself and taking off towards the east.<br></p>

            <p><b>Chapter Four</b><br><br>“German for revenge,” Sherlock says immediately. John tries to look through the Words again, to no avail. His partner kneels down to the stone, to examine the letters. <br><br>“It can’t have been left by a canonical, since they’d be writing in tengwar or runes. But why revenge? She has no way of knowing I’d be assigned to this fic. Yet…”<br><br>“Why would it be revenge? Couldn’t it be an indicator of her name – which, incidentally, you <i>forgot</i>.” John crosses his arms and watches Sherlock probe about the crime scene. The air itself seems to be suffused with Glitter.<br><br>“I do remember that she has a friend we’ll also have to kill, and that aside from Aragorn and Legolas she has also replaced Frodo and Lord Elrond.” Sherlock straightens up, smirking. “And that she is the daughter of Manwë and Varda.”<br><br>“What.” John frowns.<br><br>“That was particularly memorable. And come to think of it, it could explain her disappearance. After all, the Valar are aware of us from time to time.”<br><br>“Yes, but… the daughter of <i>Manwë and Varda</i>? Seriously?”<br><br>“At least it isn’t Galadriel and Gandalf,” Sherlock points out sweetly. “The new Hobbit film frames their relationship in a strangely non-professional light. Or at least the trailers indicate such.”<br><br>John rolls his eyes. “Exactly what we needed,” he deadpans. “Are we done here?”<br><br>“Possibly.” Sherlock looks about, before kneeling down again and leaning over the edge of the bridge to peer into the waters below. “Based on the footprints all over the bridge, tracking mud from the path, and the patterns of broken leaves nearby, this was the last spot she visited prior to her disappearance. She wasn’t alone – another person – elf, probably – was with her. There was a struggle of some sort, culminating in…”<br><br>Something twinkling catches the Agent’s eyes; slowly he lowers his arms towards the rippling water – <br><br>SPLASH! With a very undignified yelp, Agent Sherlock Holmes tumbles off the bridge into the water. John can’t help but laugh.<br><br>Sherlock glowers at him from the riverbed as he clambers to his feet and stalks out of the water, clothes soaked. In his hand he clutches a ring. <br><br>“The Sue lost her Extra Ring of Power,” declares the dark-haired Agent, smirking. “Despite her efforts, we really are acquiring quite a profile on her. Let’s go find more data.”<br><br>~~<br><br>John feels confused, to say the very least. Sherlock is driving the mission like a crime scene investigation, despite already having known the answers before. He’d like to question the veracity of Sherlock’s confession – Sherlock certainly knows his way about the in-fic Rivendell, even though he’s deleted key information like the Sue’s name and appearance from his mind.<br><br>And who deletes things from their memory at will anyway? John wishes he could do that; it’d certainly save him a fortune in Bleeprin. <br><br>They’re back inside now and sitting in the Hall of Fire; Sherlock is staring up at the ceiling, as if looking for divine inspiration. His hands are folded together, fingers steepled, and his brows seem clouded with thought. John looks around at the extras milling about the hall, coming in and out; in precious few places is the Canon preserved. It’s almost tragic. <br><br>“My beloved daughter is lost! Can you help me?” someone beseeches.  <br><br>Sherlock and John turn and stare at the speaker with varying degrees of shock. Lord Elrond – or rather, ‘Lord Elrod’ judging by the mini-Balrog floating next to him – clutches at Sherlock’s still-soaked robes, hysterical tears pouring out of his eyes. John takes the mini and puts it away with Bruien and Aragon. <br><br>“I cannot find my beloved Celeste Sakurablossom; have you seen her at all?” <br><br>“Um.” John frowns. “I thought your daughter’s name was Arwen.”<br><br>Elrond draws himself upright, looking highly affronted. “As if that hag’s my daughter! No, my daughter is the much prettier Celeste; do you know where she’s gone or will I have to take you to the dungeons?”<br><br>“I didn’t know Rivendell had dungeons,” Sherlock remarks drily. <br><br>“We’ll keep an eye out for her,” John adds, as the elf lord whirls about and flounces away, obviously in a huff.<br><br>“Idiot,” mutters Sherlock as Lord Elrond vanishes out of the hall.<br><br>“Hey! He’s not –”<br><br>“Normally, no.” Sherlock rolls his eyes.<br><br>“Is she the one? Celeste?”<br><br>“I doubt it,” Sherlock replies. “Wrong father, for one.”<br><br>“Yes, but the way Elrond said it made it seem as if he’s disowned Arwen and adopted Celeste instead.”<br><br>Sherlock grimaces. “Point. We’ll look out for –”<br><br>“Looking for anything?” a sultry voice cuts in before Sherlock can say another word. A young woman stands before them, tall and willowy with blonde hair and green eyes. She pushes her cleavage in Sherlock’s general direction, not noticing his nose wrinkling in distaste, and titters coyly.<br><br>“Certainly not that,” Sherlock snaps. “Celeste Sakurablossom?”<br><br>“Aye, tis me.”<br><br>Sherlock turns to John, who is staring at the girl with wide eyes. He snaps his fingers. “Not the one.”<br><br>Celeste pouts. Sherlock turns back to her, an eyebrow raised. <br><br>“What can you tell me about your friend?” he demands. “The one who has replaced Frodo, Aragorn, and Legolas –”<br><br>“Gornie is mine!” Celeste snaps, eyes welling with tears. “You can’t take him –”<br><br>“Legolas and Frodo, then. Do you know what happened? Why is your friend hiding? <i>Tell me</i>!” The canon is, after all, so distorted and warped at this point that the character-replaced canonicals have become aware of them; accosting a subordinate Sue hardly seems like an issue. <br><br>A single tear slips from Celeste’s eyes. “I-I-I don’t know what you’re t-talking about!” she blubbers. <br><br>“Yes you do, and you will <i>cooperate with me</i>!” Sherlock snarls, spitting the words into her face. Celeste recoils with a squeak, before finally stammering:<br><br>“L-L-Leggiekins w-was the last one!”<br><br>Sherlock draws away from her, frowning. “She got to Frodo first.”<br><br>“Aye,” breathes Celeste. “F-first Frodo and L-Lord Elrond… and then Gornie and L-Leggie…”<br><br>“She carried an Extra Ring of Power when she went to seduce Legolas on the bridge.”<br><br>“How’d… you know that?”<br><br>“I don’t know; I deduce.” Sherlock glowers at her. “She struggled with him, but eventually Legolas was replaced; she left a note on the bridge prior to disappearing. Did you see her after that?”<br><br>“N-no…” sobs Celeste. <br><br>“Do you remember what your friend looks like?”<br><br>Celeste tries to nod, but something seems to be preventing her from doing so. “No…”<br><br>“Do you remember anything at all about your friend?”<br><br>Once more, Celeste attempts to say her friend’s name, but all that comes out is: “No! You can’t hurt her! I won’t let you!”<br><br>“Hurt?” Sherlock seems to mull over the word for a moment before grinning, shark-like. “No, we’re not going to just <i>hurt</i> her.” He pauses. “<i>Kill</i> her, yes. John, read Celeste’s charges.”<br><br>“What?” John looks up from where he’s been taking notes. “Oh, right. Yes. Um. Celeste Sakurablossom, you are hereby charged with being a subordinate Sue, with replacing the characters of Lord Elrond and Aragorn, son of Arathorn, with replacing Arwen’s role in the canon and causing Elrond to disown his own daughter, with inserting a dungeon into Rivendell, with breaking up a canon romance – namely one engagement between Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Arwen Undómiel, with using nauseating pet-names for Legolas and Aragorn, and with aiding and abetting your friend in her own transgressions against canon. Your sentence is death; any last words?”<br><br>“No!” sobs Celeste. “Please, no! Have mercy! Have – <i>urk</i>.”<br><br>John sets down the bow and pulls the arrow out of the dead Sue’s throat. “One down, one to go,” he says, slightly more cheered up. “Do you think she’ll be at the Council?”<br></p>

            <p><b>Chapter Three</b><br><br>An ellon walks past at that very moment, a dazed look in his eyes. “My beautiful lady; you doth teach the stars to shine bright!” he says to thin air. “Why must thou leave me like this, stranded alone in a sea of nothingness?”<br><br>Sherlock groans. “Must they use Shakespearean English?” he demands.<br><br>“It could be worse,” John replies. <br><br>“No, now it’s <i>going</i> to be worse. Thank you,” Sherlock drawls, rolling his eyes. The ellon wanders off, mumbling confusedly to himself. <br><br>“Who was that supposed to be anyway?” John demands, because the Words are still a garbled mess, and Sherlock is already crossing the wide courtyard to the main building. The shorter Agent follows, barely keeping with his partner’s strides with his own hobbling limps. “The Words aren’t very helpful, so…”<br><br>“Blond hair, green and brown tunic, a face like Orlando Bloom’s? I’m surprised you didn’t recognise him,” Sherlock says, tapping his chin thoughtfully. “That was –”<br><br>“So, like, I was really put off that she just poofed away, you know? It’s so frustrating because I’m so in loooove with her!” another voice cuts in, and the two Agents spin around to see Legolas, dressed in pink.<br><br>“That wasn’t Legolas,” amends Sherlock, coughing uncomfortably. “I really should not jump to conclusions.”<br><br>John is too busy staring at not-Legolas in horror. “What in Arda happened to him?” he demands, eyes wide. Sherlock opens his mouth to say a scathing comment, but John shakes his head. “That was a rhetorical question.”<br><br>“I knew that,” Sherlock says immediately. <br><br>“Sure.” John. Not-Legolas stares at them confusedly, eyes shifting in and out of focus. <br><br>“Like, who are you?” he demands after a moment.<br><br>“Leaving,” John says hastily, grabbing Sherlock’s arm and pulling him into the main building. “He’s not supposed to see us. Why did he see us?”<br><br>“Character replacement,” conjectures Sherlock. A sudden manic glint appears in his eyes as he claps his hands together. “We need more data. Come on, John!”<br><br>~~<br><br>They encounter Aragorn – or rather, ‘Aragon’ – within moments. Said Dúnadan is dressed in fluorescent pink as well, and singing about rainbows and unicorns. John cringes; Sherlock shudders and mutters something about being glad John’s CAD had shorted out.<br><br>“What we know so far from the random ellon and not-Legolas is that there has been a Sue wreaking havoc, but she disappeared,” the dark-haired Agent says as soon as they reach a more secluded hall. John takes out his camera, intent on snapping pictures of the pretty elvish architecture. “That means that the Sue is in hiding; the fact that she disappeared prior to our arrival suggests that – John, are you even listening to me?”<br><br>“I am,” John replies, snapping a picture of a nearby tapestry. <br><br>“That’s childish,” Sherlock points out.<br><br>“That’s also extremely nice architecture.” But John puts the camera away nonetheless. “All right, fine. I’ll listen. Considering Legolas can see us, I probably shouldn’t have had it out in the first place. You were saying?”<br><br>“The Sue is in hiding because of us. That’s why the Words are garbled and she’s nowhere to be found, yet signs of her… presence are still here.”<br><br>“What Department were you in previously?” John asks suddenly. “You seem to know a lot about the situation.”<br><br>“I was in Intelligence,” Sherlock replies. “But my brother decided to move me.”<br><br>“Your brother –”<br><br>“Works in Personnel,” Sherlock says, rolling his eyes. “If he really wanted to, he could become the next Mysterious Somebody. Thank the Powers that Be that he’s too fat and lazy to do so.”<br><br>John snorts. “Yeah, that’s good. But why did you transfer out?”<br><br>“Can we get back to the work?”<br><br>John raises both hands in an appeasing gesture. “Fine, if you insist. I was just curious.”<br><br>Sherlock sighs, and strides out of the hall once more with John in tow. John makes a noise of protest as he tries to keep up with Sherlock; his partner seems to have forgotten that John has a limp and a wounded shoulder. “I was the one who did the Intelligence report for this story prior to my transfer,” he explains. “I deleted most of it from my hard drive once it was over, but small details still exist. Like that time when I ran into the Sue.”<br><br>John stops in the middle of the hallway, gaping at Sherlock. “You… <i>what</i>?”<br><br>Sherlock laughs. “You were wondering why I transferred,” he points out, before taking a left out onto a patio. Leading from the patio is a small wooded path, heading to a small bridge partially screened by trees. <br><br>“You’re saying now that the reason why this Sue disappeared from the text is because she found you and by proxy the rest of us?”<br><br>“I was never one for spying,” Sherlock replies, scowling.<br><br>“Don’t you even remember what she looks like? Where she could be hiding? Her <i>name</i>?”<br><br>“Deleted, deleted, deleted –”<br><br>“Sherlock!” John seizes Sherlock by the front of his robes, pulling him closer. “This mission is one breath away from failing, and now you’re telling me it’s your fault! I could kill you right about now.”<br><br>“Don’t,” Sherlock suggests, pointing to the bridge. In the middle of the walkway, painted onto the weathered stone, is a single word in Urple:<br><br><i>RACHE</i>.<br></p>

            <p>You appear to behind the times, for there is this marvellous new adaptation they call &quot;BBC Sherlock&quot;, and I derive my characterisation from them.<br><br>Also, I believe that&#39;s the point of an alternate universe. Certainly your Jaycacia stories fall into that because I cannot see a grain of proper characterisation with the PPC characters in her stories.</p>

            <p>((ooc note: please change &#39;scaf&#39; to &#39;scarf&#39; in the previous chapter; I didn&#39;t catch that until too late))<br><br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><br>“Rivendell. It’s always bloody Rivendell,” grouses John as the portal closes behind them and they look out onto the vale of Imladris, fair and green in the morning sun. The halls of Elrond can be seen faintly in the distance, roofs shining in the sunlight. Waterfalls cascade all about; the Bruinen rushes through the vale, gurgling proudly. <br><br>All of this is sadly marred by the presence of a mini-Balrog. “Bruien,” Sherlock remarks, as John opens his bag to let the mini clamber into the fireproofed compartment specifically meant for minis. <br><br>“How’d you know that? The Intelligence report said there were more.” John tries to check the Words, but they slip and slide away from his sight; the fic seems to be resisting against their presence, fighting against the Canon that welcomes them.<br><br>“We’re looking at the Bruinen,” Sherlock replies, gesturing to the river rushing nearby. They are both disguised as elves; John feels that he’ll never get used to the feeling of having hair that could be used in a shampoo commercial. It’s unnatural. Sherlock, though, takes his elvish appearance in stride.<br><br>John nods. “Fair enough.” He tries to look at the Words again, but they still evade his grasp. “Sherlock, is there something wrong with the Words? They’re not letting me…”<br><br>“The Sue is aware of our presence,” Sherlock says immediately. “Time’s running out.” And with light elven footsteps, he heads for the parapet-less bridge leading them towards the Last Homely House.<br><br>~~<br><br>Unfortunately, the Halls of Elrond are not as homely as they used to be, before the canon was so assailed by the Mary Sues. John looks up at the grotesque, distorted spires of Rivendell, and a part of him curls in anger.<br><br>Protection of the canon – that’s what he signed up for. To defend what’s right. So he squares his shoulders and follows his new partner into Rivendell, only to be greeted by a piercing shriek from his bag.<br><br>“Glaurungit!” he growls, pausing and ducking away from curious stares to open his pack and pull out his Canon Analysis Device, which seems to be emitting smoke from its very being. John looks at it in horror; the readout says:<br><br>[<i>ERROR ERROR MR JIM JAM JELLY BING BONG DATA ERROR CANNOT FUNCTION I CANNOT I AM 34239084092384902384% DONE OLLIES OUTIE</i>]<br><br>“Who walked past?” Sherlock demands, striding over with a scowl. John holds up his now-dead CAD, shrugging.<br><br>“I think it just bailed out on us.”<br><br>Sherlock snorts. “Clever CAD. What about the Character Analysis one?”<br><br>“Don’t you have it?”<br><br>Sherlock shakes his head. “I’m sure you can spot a Sue when you see one, unless Upstairs really is scraping the bottom of the barrel –”<br><br>“I’m not the bottom of the barrel,” John snaps defensively. Sherlock snorts, and turns away.<br><br>John pockets his CAD, the anger deep within him boiling into rage. The Sue has rendered the very air of Rivendell out of character. Someone is going to <i>pay</i>.<br></p>

Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings?”<br><br>“Lord of the Rings… how did you know that?”<br><br>“The types of swords along the walls as trophies, the spare wands… we’re in the Department of Mary Sues, so the balance of probability is that your partner died fighting with a Warrior!Sue.

Sadly, both the DioM and PPC fans flamed it to hell and back, it got removed, and to make matters worse it was lost when my hard disk died)<br>Dustin/Verra (Because Five of Six and Alec Troven are both overrated)<br>Tawaki/Chrysocome (Their DNA isn&#39;t even the same anymore)<br>Snapshot/Alice (Why not?)<br>Suicide/Ithalond (Suicide does hail from ancient Greece, after all)<br>Cavan/Luxury (They&#39;re so similar in personality, and they both come from worlds where Really Gets Around is the norm)<br>Jara/Zan (Death <i>has</i> parted Jara and Ket, you know)<br><br><b>OFUs</b>:<br>Madison/Nara (From the Myst OFU; despite the cliffhanger, you can see the Foe Yay coming a mile away)<br>Miss Minnaloushe/Kihr (From the Cats OFU)<br>Heather/Terry (From the Friendship Is Magic OFU)<br><br><b><i>Stories in progress</i></b><br><b>Return to HQ</b> -- Madison is back, and Nara is now an agent. Can they pick up where they left off?<br><b>The Time Vector</b> -- An attempt to redo the Tawaki/Dustin fic that drew so much ire on FFN.</b></p>

            <p>Title: Teh spaces between<br>Genre: Romance, Hurt/Comfort<br>Rating: M<br>Summary: Eledhwen finds comfot with Mr Hugh<br><br><b>Teh spaces between</b><br><br>“She hit you again, didn’t she?” <br><br>Eledhwen looked flornly at the man standing at the window, looking out at the rain. She sniffled, a single diamond tear slipping down her pale cheeks.<br><br>The man standing at the window turned to face her, his blond hair shining pale in the half-light, his thick brows furrowed over piercing blue eyes. He looked a lot like Benedict Cumberbatch (Author’s Note: but less so than Mr Ben, who looked exactly like Benedict!).<br><br>“I’m sorry,” he said after a moment, walking over and cupping Eledhwen’s face, looking into the elleth’s silvery orbs. His eyes casted across her bruises and cuts at the hands of her evil abusive ‘lover’. “I’m sorry she does this to you.”<br><br>“You have to save me,” Eledhwen whispered. “Please, I beg of you, Hugh. Take me away.”<br><br>Hugh’s eyes filled with tears. “IAHF can never be your home, though. It’s too far removed from Arda.”<br><br>“Anything is better than going back to her,” sobbed Eledhwen. “You must save me.”<br><br>Mr Hugh nods, eyes silent. “I will,” he agrees, and leans in to kiss her.<br><br>Eledhwen leaned up into the kiss, opening her mouth to his probing tongue as they deepened it, made it more and more passionate. She moaned into his mouth, her breath a soft whisper against his, and wrapped her arms around him, holding him close.<br><br>“Thank you,” she breathed when they broke apart. She pressed a gentle kiss to his neck, and more along his jawline. “Thank you so much.”<br><br>“I love you,” he replied.<br><br>~~<br><br><i>“They’re writing fanfiction about us again,” Christianne groaned as she slammed the sheaf of papers onto Eledhwen’s bed. Eledhwen looked up, blinking wildly. <br><br>“Fanfiction about us?” she echoed. “Wait, no, I thought…”<br><br>“That the authoress writing about you and Lori was done? Nope.” Christianne cackled. “She ships you with Mr Hugh now, too.”<br><br>The elleth gaped. “That’s preposterous,” she said. <br><br>“I know,” agreed Christianne. “He’s still hung over whats-her-face, Takara. Stockholm Syndrome much?”<br><br>Eledhwen laughed. “She did turn out okay in the end,” she pointed out, before picking up the papers and beginning to read.</i><br><br>~~<br><br>Eledhwen started kissing Hugh’s neck more and more, her kisses getting sloppier and sloppier in her haste. They’d started out nice and orderly but now they were wild, passionate; she was lost in her desperation to escape her demons and the demon she had once called her friend. <br><br>“Are you sure about this?” Mr Hugh asked, one finger running along th eelleths pointed ear.<br><br>“Absolutely,” Eledhwen breathed, kissing the course coodrinatr of IAHF firmly on the mouth once more, pushing him back towards the window as outside the rain began to fall more and more steadily. “Make love to me. Make me forget.”<br><br>“I will,” agreed Hugh, tugging at his sweatervest.<br><br>~~<br><br><i>“Eru,” whistled Eledhwen, staring at the papers in morbid fascination. “Lilith Wydenbrooke hates you.”<br><br>“No shit, Sherlock.” Christianne sat down on the bed next to her partner; Eledhwen’s brows furrowed as she did so. “Apparently I abuse you half to hell; sitting on your bed’s the least I can do.”<br><br>“Preposterous,” declared the elleth, as if it was a new word and she wanted to use it as much as possible. “You’d sooner abuse someone who even looked the wrong way at me.”<br><br>“I’m not</i> that <i>defensive.”<br><br>“That boy at MBSFA – wasn’t his name Alan Cablen? – Well, he’d certainly beg to differ.”<br><br>“Yes, well,” Christianne coughed, shifting uncomfortably, “he’s just an idiot who was trying to touch your ears.”<br><br>Eledhwen huffed, and returned to the story.</i><br><br>~~<br><br> Mr Hugh pushed Eledwhen up against the window more insistently now, tugging lightly at her bottom lip with his teeth, his own fingers fumbling with his trousers; he was already – <br><br>~~<br><br><i>Eledhwen made a disgusted noise at the back of her throat. “Tasteless descriptions about our states of arousal, more tasteless description, more urple prose, more comparing my nether regions to secret hollows and wells of purity and…” she turned a faint shade of chartreuse at the next segment. “Yavanna’s fruits!”<br><br>“What?” Christianne demanded, peering over her partner’s shoulder.<br><br>“She compares… compares his… to a… to a…” Eledhwen’s hands were shaking. “I refuse to read this.”<br><br>“Skip it,” Christianne consoled. Eledhwen sighed, and turned the page.</i><br><br>~~<br><br>“Have you done this before?” asked Mr Hugh. Eledhwen shook her head.<br><br>“Well, with Christianne, but that was rape so it’s not legitimate,” Eledhwen sniffed. “And besides she’s a girl it doesn’t count.”<br><br>~~<br><br><i>“I should’ve been fading, then, if that were the case,” Eledhwen growled at the paper.<br><br>“As non-consensual as whatever happened to you in this fic was, you’re still not a virgin,” Christianne added. “Not that I give a toss about that. Virginity’s a concept.”</i><br><br>~~<br><br>“She didn’t put anything in you right?”<br><br>“Yeah”<br><br>“Then you’re still a virgin.”<br><br>~~<br><br><i>Christianne slammed her palm against her forehead. Repeatedly. With brutal force. Eledhwen caught her by the wrist before she could do it again, and for a moment they simply paused and looked at each other.<br><br>“Don’t harm yourself,” Eledhwen said after a moment.<br><br>Christianne looked like she was about to argue about what exactly should constitute ‘legitimate’ sex, but thought better of it. She sighed, subsiding.<br><br>Neither of them pulled their hands away.</i><br><br>~~<br><br>Embolded, Hugh kissed Eledhwen again as she wrapped her legs around him, positioning herself for his – <br><br>~~<br><br><i>“I will skip ahead,” Eledhwen declared, clutching at the paper so tightly that her knuckles shone white. “You don’t mind?”<br><br>“Go on,” Christianne agreed, squeezing Eledhwen’s hand reassuringly. The elleth turned several pages, skimming over the words with a nauseated expression on her face. <br><br>“It’s not a muscle; even I know that,” she grumbled. <br><br>“What?”<br><br>“</i>He broke through her virginal muscle with a smooth thrust<i>,” Eledhwen read, grimacing. Christianne cringed.<br><br>“Ouch.”<br><br>“Indeed.”<br><br>Christianne bit her lip. “Wait, what did you mean by ‘even I know that’?” she asked.<br><br>Eledhwen shrugged. “Elves do not indulge in carnal pleasures, for doing so would bind them to each other in a bond much like that of marriage. Indeed, such an act –”<br><br>“Plain English, please.”<br><br>“Sex equals marriage.”<br><br>“Ah. So you</i> are <i>a virgin.”<br><br>“Does it matter?”<br><br>Christianne shrugged. “No.”</i><br><br>~~<br><br>Eledhwen threw back her head and moaned aloud as she climaxed, star bursting behind her eyes. A single tear slid down her cheek once more; Hugh kissed it away, lips feather-light against her pale skin as he followed with a groan, spilling himself inside her.<br><br>“I love you,” breathed Eledhwen, her arms going about Hugh’s neck as she kissed him desperately, as if she wanted to breathe him into her and keep him next to her heart. Hugh kissed her back, arms going around her delicate waist, strong and protective.<br><br>~~<br><br><i>“The maudlin post-coital cuddling goes on for pages,” complained Christianne, looking ahead. <br><br>“Yes, but that’s all there is, isn’t there?” Eledhwen skipped ahead as well. “Yes, that’s all there is, thank Elbereth.”<br><br>“It’s funny how Lilith seems to be the only one who doesn’t want to see us together. Judging by the writings of some of the </i>other <i>fanbrats in FanficWorld…” Christianne rolled her eyes. “Lori wasn’t kidding about the pool, was she?”<br><br>“I doubt it,” Eledhwen replied, looking at Christianne as she set the fic down on the bed next to them. “Those… fanbrats… function under the rationale that because we work in the BBC Sherlock fandom –”<br><br>“We should make like John and Sherlock and just kiss already,” finished Christianne. “Yes, I’m aware of that.”<br><br>Eledhwen snorted. “A likely occurrence, given your decidedly straightforward statement about your heterosexuality. I won’t press.”<br><br>Christianne looked down at their hands, at their entwined fingers. “I don’t think so,” she said after a moment. “I can make exceptions.”<br><br>Eledhwen laughed. “Whatever you’d like,” she replied, smiling at her partner. The fanfic lay to the side, long forgotten.</i><br><br><b>Fin.</b><br><br>((OOC note: Can you change my profile?

            <p><b>Author’s Notes:</b> HEYYYYYYYYY! IT’S ME, LILY WINTERWOOD! I’VE HACKED INTO LILITH WYDENBROOKE’S ACCOUNT TO ADD MY OWN TWO CENTS ON HOW ATROCIOUS I THINK THIS FANFIC IS. SHE THINK’S SHE A GOODFIC WRITER, BUT SHE’S NOT. AND I AM GOING TO KILL HER FOR MUTILATING MY CHARACTERS ANYWAYS, SO I MIGHT AS WELL TACK ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENS TO THIS STORY.<br><br>Epilogue: What The Frak?<br><br>“What is this?” Eledhwen Elerossiel demanded as she stared at the sheaf of papers on the table before her.<br><br>“I don’t know, but the authoress—Lilith Wydenbrooke—needs to die a painful death,” Christianne Shieh grumbled.<br><br>“So say we all,” Lori Starrett murmured, twitching a little. “I think I need a gallon of Bleepka. Right about now.”<br><br>“Leave some for me, won’t you?” Bill Fallis demanded, one possessive arm snaking around his wife’s waist. Lori rolled her eyes and shoved him lightly.<br><br>“Awww, Bill, you’re not jealous, are you?” she teased. “I don’t like Eledhwen that way, silly.”<br><br>“I’m hurt,” Eledhwen mocked, pretending to blow a kiss to the Scientists. Lori cackled.<br><br>“Don’t give Bill ideas, <i>‘Ledhwen</i>,” she chided, still grinning.<br><br>Eledhwen scowled at the nickname. “And I thought ‘Ellie’ was a terrible substitute,” she grumbled.<br><br>“It doesn’t really matter, though,” Lori remarked thoughtfully. “I mean, I think there’s this pool going around HQ as to when the two of you would –”<br><br>Eledhwen and Christianne stared at each other. Eledhwen raised an eyebrow. Christianne turned pale.<br><br>“I-I-I’m not gay,” she said, frowning.<br><br>“No one said you were,” Eledhwen replied cheerily, adding ‘my dear Watson’ in a lower voice. Christianne facepalmed, and pointedly scooted away from her partner.<br><br>Bill chuckled, because Schadenfruede was a beautiful thing, and kissed his wife on the cheek. Lori turned to return the favor. Christianne rolled her eyes and poured herself a shot of Bleepka.<br><br>“I think you two are worse than the fic, in some way,” she muttered.<br><br>Eledhwen massaged her temples. “What was the saying again? Ah yes. Get a room, you two.”<br><br>“Gladly,” Lori replied, looking smug. “We’ve got to finish that Personality Dialysis lab write-up, anyways. Ta ta.”<br><br>The two scientists left the Response Center as Christianne set down her shot-glass of Bleepka. “What a story. I’m so flattered that the author thinks that I’m so evil. And that you’re so pretty that you get to get married to Laura Roslin.” Her words dripped with sarcasm, making Eledhwen grin.<br><br>“They’d have me dead before I could propose marriage,” the elleth mused. “I doubt Admiral Adama would find it a laughing matter.”<br><br>“Amen to that,” Christianne said as she called Mara Labingi over. Placing the papers on the mini-Balrog’s back, the two Agents contentedly watched the papers go up in smoke and flames. “Let’s get ourselves ready for our next mission,” Christianne sighed as the ashes of the fanfic rolled off of the mini’s back.<br><br>Eledhwen immediately swooped down on them with a dustpan and brush. “Wait a minute; I need to clean this up and then I need to make sure all of the minis aren’t messing up their little corner of the RC,” she growled as she effortlessly swept the ashes into the pan.<br><br>Christianne giggled. “Some things never change.”<br></p>

            <p>Chapter Six: The Final Curtain<br><br>“Muahahahahahahahahahahaha!” Christianne laughed as she advanced on her partner with her dagger. <br><br>“Christianne!” Eledhwen screamed “I’ll kill myself, I don’t want you to!”<br><br>“But what’s the fun and evil in that?” Christianne wondered evilly. <br><br>Eledhwen’s eyes suddenly glowed pink and purple as she stood up forcefully. “Through the power of my love for the fair Lori Starrett, Christianne Shieh, I shall smite thee and cast thee into the Void.” Saying that, she raised her hand, conjuring up a pink and purple ball of light. “Begone, foul mortal!” <br><br>The ball of light sucked the evil agent Christianne into it, and she was never seen again!<br><br>Eledhwen slumped against the wall again, closing her eyes in despair. “Oh Valar, please let me die,” she whispered.<br>“Please let me fade away.”<br><br>“No,” a voice said. Eledhwen looked up. It was the SO.<br><br>(Author’s Note: I don’t see what the harm is in letting the Flowers talk like normal people. So there.)<br><br>“What are you doing here, sir?” Eledhwen asked.<br><br>“I have come to tell you that you are now allowed to go into the Battlestar Galactica fandom and find yourself a new life partner there. You do not have to come back.”<br><br>“Oh, thank you, sir,” Eledhwen said, saluting the Flower. “I will never forget your kindness.” Saying that, she opened a portal and disappeared from HQ forevermore.<br><br>In the BSG fandom, Eledhwen exerted her charms and eventually married the President of the Twelve Colonies, Laura Roslin. She did so to remind herself of the happiest days of her life—when she met Lori Starrett. When Laura Roslin died, Eledhwen faded away for good.<br><br>She returned to the far-off country of Valinor, where she saw Prince Legolas of Mirkwood. Sitting at his side was a red-haired woman who wore pure white robes. The robes of an angel.<br><br>At first she couldn’t recgonize the woman until she moved her arms from her chest and Eledhwen saw a scarlet blossom on her breast, a representation of a mortal wound received so long ago.<br><br>“Lori!” she cried, weeping tears of happiness as the woman got up and walked towards her. “I thought I’d never see you again!”<br><br>“It is I,” Lori Starrett concurred. “And I am reunited with my lover at last.” She did not look at the Prince of Mirkwood, instead, her eyes were solely for Eledhwen, and they sparkled with love. “I love you, Eledhwen Elerossiel. I have waited all this time since my death to see you again, and now I am rewarded.”<br><br>And so from then on, Lori Starrett and Eledhwen Elerossiel lived happily ever after.<br><br>The End.<br><br><b>Author’s Notes:</b> Thanks to all who have read this story!

            <p>Chapter Four: The Morning After<br><br>The pearly sunlight entered the room through a window and was filtered by soft green drapes before it landed on the sleeping forms of two women in the bed. <br><br>Lori opened her eyes, smiling and blushing prettily at the events of the night before and turned to her newfound lover. “Darling, wake up. It’s morning,” she chirped.<br><br>Eledhwen groggily opened an eye. “It is?” she moaned. <br><br>Lori laughed, her laughter like little chimes. “It is!” she leaned in and kissed the elleth on the lips. “Shouldn’t you be getting back before Christianne…”<br><br>“Before what?” a harpy-like voice demanded from the doorway. Lo, it was Christianne and she was murderous! “Eledhwen, you never slept with me! Not fair!” she whined murderously.<br><br>“But I did not love you enough to sleep with you,” the elleth replied cooly.<br><br>Christianne glowered. “I hate you,” she growled. “I hate you enough to kill you.” She took out a dagger as she said so. “But I’m not going to kill you yet. I’m going to kill your lover and watch you fade away with sorrow.”<br><br>Lori’s eyes widened. Eledhwen gasped and clutched at Lori. “You can’t!” she cried passionately.<br><br>“I will.” Christianne smirked evilly and decked Eledhwen. The elleth crumpled. <br><br>Lori screamed, “Eledhwen!” and threw herself onto the body of her lover, sobbing piteously. Christianne laughed meanly before she drove the dagger straight into Lori’s heart.<br><br>To Be Continued…<br><br><b>Author’s Note:</b> Oh NO! Cliffhanger! I’m so evil!

            <p>Hai, Im Amythyst Queen (not Amythyst Queen, that’s spelled wrong, stupid sight i totally typed a u,) an I am soo new here, lol. I can’t beleaf that u all are reading my pagie, lol. I am working to be better with my spellin an such, pls don tell me my grammer socks Bcus half the time I hav to reply on my fone becus my stupid brother hogs the comp. So short is just faster. Ive gotta reply to <i>everybody</i> fast as possible, mkay? Don’t want to leave anybody hanging becus that’s rude. Ive put this in my spellchequer and it’s OK, does anyone know how get rid of the green lines?<br><br>Anyways, I should introduce u all to my OC’s. I don have pictures because I can draw. *Is sad* If anyone draws me a pic of my OCs I will love you forever (but not like that, I don’t really know you, lol.)<br><br>Name: Agnet Nemedra (hes that is spelled rite.)<br>Age: about 19 becose they count different when she’s from but old enough to be in the army anyway<br><br>Speshes: Human<br><br>Hair: Really pretty and black and she wears it a lot longer than most of the other girls in the space marines but that’s okay because cutting it was a stupid old_fashioned rule and her CO’s respect that<br><br>Eyes: Pretty greenish grayish blue (I know those could be sue eyes BUT I know a girl in my English class she has eyes that really look like they change colour even they don really they just look like it so real life people do have these kinds of eyes.)<br><br>Height: She’s taller than me and abou 5foot 6<br><br>Wight: A lady never tells<br><br>Weapon: guns, guns, more guns, knives, um, lazer pistol thingy, but mostly she’s a sniper so guns<br><br>Lust Object: it will be Tripp from STenterpris but she hasn’t seen ST yet in the story<br><br>Home world: shg is from a planet in Traveler (it is a great game) called Mist (I know that isn’t a real traveler planet but there are a lot of them and I don’t want to get something wrong because I ont ah the book anyor.)<br><br>Continuums: Star War, Star tRek (Just Enterprise, I’ve only seen most of it but not all of the later seasons when the zyndi were,0 um… Cobra trilogy and harry potter and lord of the riengs and just look at my profile page for the other things I’ve red, okay?<br><br>Backstory: Nemedra is one tough chick she is a sniper in the space marines and the best shot in her class she doesn’t suffer fool gladly so it is only natural she is a leader among the new recruits and will be an officer soon. Or would be if her ship hadn’t blown up and she landed in HQ with nobody surviving the wreck except for her and Agent Vid who she only sort of knew because even though they were both popular they did rin in the same circles inc training or anything.<br><br>Anyhow the marquee de sod didn’t bother much with her and vid (he is such a butt lol but there has to be on in every fandom so we all have someon to hate) so they got an RC and got sent a bunch of missions and stuff and are basically getting popular in the PPC because there aren’t lots of peo9poe with military training really military training in the Ppc. Excepth maybe suiocide and stuff. But I don’t know if I will include him in any of the storie s of anything yet.<br><br>Name: Agent Vidresk (He goes by Vid but don’t call him viddy he’s too tough, lol.) <br><br>Age:  I think he’s about 20 or so and already a lieutenant so hamsome.<br><br>Speces:  He is human and I feel really boring that all of my OC’s are human but I’ve made up for it with the third one you’e see. <br><br>Hair:  It’s blacl and it’s messy like boys hair usually is he’s kind of hot but doesn’t know it lol.<br><br>Eyes:  He has green eyes like Harry p otter but in his case they come from his dad’s side of the family a lot of people have green eyes where he’s from.<br><br>Height:  Six! Feet1 *swoon*<br><br>Wait:  umm… however much six foot tall guys weh? He’s not fat but he’s got a lot of muscle because pushups and stuff.<br><br>Weapon:  Everything. He shoots a lazer rifle and stuff but Nemedra is better at shooting so he usually does the te h stuff like fiint the Cad. He also keeps knves in his boots and he has a special ray gun for esecuting sues.<br><br>Lust Object:  Gusy, I haven’t thought about this for Vid bcos I don’t spend a lot fo time looking through my fav books for pretty girls so if somebosy wants’ to suggest one…? No, he’s not getting together with Nemedra and I thionk there’s too many PPC characts who lo is Galadriel or Elizabeth Swan (not bella, she is icky,) so somebody different mkay?<br><br>Home World: His planet is Bakon like Nemedra he hasn’t been there since he joined the Marins and anyways his parents are dead of invasion and stuff so he left when he was sixteen and lied about his age and joined up the marins. <br><br>Continuums: Just look at the list for me and for Nemedra.<br><br>Bacjstiry: Vid is basically this totally normal hot guy who joined army at an early age because he wanted to get away from home where nothing was for him. He shots real well and is really really funny so he is the ‘wise guy’ in the RC but her totally respects Nemedra bcos of all they have gone through  together now including the exploding ship which he is sad about which it gives him bad drams sometime. <br><br>He was lutennant and he very respected in the space marine. He also is based on character from one of my RP last summer with my best friend but totally different because I picked out different skills that make sense because he is PpPc. So he is good at mechanics and stuff and sometimes people take their brokeh stff to him and not Doat because he rewires the console to make it less annoying and tuff. Alsooo, he is dreamy and if you want your girl agents with him all you have to do is say the word and I’ll hook them up in one of the stories. Guy agents to I guess if you want but it wouldn’t be cannons.<br><br>Name: Agent Trask, Velociraptor!<br><br>Age:  I dunno but if he were human he’d be sixteen or something like that.<br><br>Speeis:  VVelociraptor! It is cool he kills sues with his toes wow I am bloodthirst lol.<br><br>Hair:  He is a dinosaur, duh.<br><br>Eyes:  <i>YELLOW!</i><br><br>Haight:  he is about up to Vid’s knee and the size of a dog but he is <i>not</i> a pet or a caf okay? He is a PERSON.<br><br>Wweit:  About as much as a small dog.<br><br>Weapon:  His toes, his teeth, um… he could probably work with a knife.<br><br>Lust Object:  He doesn’t have one because it’s really hard to find any attractive dinos in HQ or anywhere als for that mater. <br><br>Continuums:  Wherever Nemedra or Vid go. He is kinda innocent so he’s been reading a lot of kids books like Vid gave him Harry Potter and he read the whole thing in like three days and he’s the one who read chronicals of Narnia and the percy Jakson series and artemis fowl and Penragon and stuff. He likes anything with dragons or scaly creatures because all of the stories he reads are about humans. <br><br>Backstory: Vid and Nemedra went to Dinotopia! They were killing some sue when they totally found a velociraptor bit character who they decided to recruit so they could get vaycays and so they borght him to Hqq. He likes it there is much better than generic space and his fic. In dino the dinosaurs bond to people and his person was dead in the fic because he was the sues father and totally had a tragic accident but the sue was all angsty and paid no attention to the dino because she was so wrapt up in her drama an sadness. Vid is Trasks new person and it’s a bit ~awkward!~ because Vid doesn’t really know what that means yet an Nemedra doesn’t stop teasing him about it. But She really does like Trask because he is kind of like a little brother or something (i no, but there are <i>lots</i> of agents who think about agents who are different speckie as family, it isn’t that bad some people write their agebhs in <i>romance</i> with people form other specie and that is desgusting,) and he is so good at ppceeing and so cute and stuff. Trask is kind shy so others don’t know much about him yet. <br><br><br><b> Okay, so I ran this through psell check like five times so Ishould be good right? Anytway, one of these days I will put up a chappie!!1 but I am really busiy right now big papers and stuff for school, hope I get done soon and the professrs stop giving homework so I can rite.</b><br><br>[This is Sevenswans.

            <p><i>AN: You get this chapter sooner than I though becaz I have discouvered a very real threat to the entire board and community also because my brother is grounded shouldn’t have called mom fastist so I get the computer now all weekend only I have to do my homework and I only get 2 hours at a time then mom makes me do something else isn that stupid.? So I hav to type fast and tell u all tht there ar people on this. very. Site. Who write marie-stews! (is that the rite way to spell a boy mary-su it is important and I don’t want it rong.) it is especiallie the boys this is becos boys are sientifically proved to b 2 years less mature than girls the same age on average in their brains and behavuoir. So my brother is twelve but his brain is ten and you can very much tell. <br><br>Anyhow becos it will breatk the brain of the PPC to eel with these PPsee fanfiction Mary-stus I guess it is up to us to get them to not to rite stop PpC would no be happy witt sues in their own site guise! <br><br>Oh, also and I made the gren lines go away on my spell chuck my mom tells me I am improving muchly at riteing. Yay.</i><br><br>Nemedra and friends plummeted to the groun nothing could save them now hardly any time to scream when Suddenly!<br><br>A flying tazi!<br><br>Vid and trask and Nemedra fell right into the empty seets it was lucky no passenters were there or someone could have been hurt. The jedi who was driving the flying taxi through the strets of crescent told them that he sensed a vabue disturbance in the fours as if ther was a power that wasn’t new jedi wasn’t sith mucking with the world. Nemedra new what that power probably was – sue – but she did no tell the jedi bcos then she would have to neuteraliese him. And the jedi took them to mace windu (AN Mase is awesome! Also yoda on different planet training luke and leia at least that what I remember from movies also slug thing but in the dessert.) who said welcome diplomats I hope u have a good stay in Crescent and it is good sity for turism especly since there no moar esploding space ships in the sky bcos we finally hav vanished the sit. <br><br>Vid was very happy to b introducted to the jedi always had he admired them better warriors than those in his home fight with the mind not just the body. And mase windu saw that all 3 were warriors so he let vid have litesabur lessins wit the padawns wile they all waited 4 the cannon 2 break Vid relly wasn’t fanboying it was a good way for them to splie up and investuhgate te jede coumpound. Trask was happy he did not need costume becus they always are adding aliyens en the expounded univrs and so a small velosiraptor was not something that surpised anyone. Whil they waited vid made his oown litesabre bcos he has like 100 ranks in mechanics so it wasn’t that hard bcos he had skills from the world he cam from. Also he wus very good with lightsaber for beginner but nemedra preferred her guns. They do not fry if dropped into swamp and anyways they are long range weapons. <br><br>Everyon pulled out their Cade and they scanned all the cannons and could nut find except that they wer all slightly out of character<br><br>Guess we hav 2 wait until the character rapture begin Said Nemedra to Vid and Trask after they had scanned every kilometer of the compounded.  They had been given room for the nite and vid was very happy he had seen Amygdala she so pretty even if she was no queen any moare. <br><br>(AN: Patty Amygdala is no Vid’s LO but he think she v. pretty and brave totally should be a jedi except she was busy being quen instead.)<br><br>‘U mammals spend ur hole life thinking about other mammals,’ sed Trask.<br><br>‘no that is just the boyhs,’ sed nemedra, ‘that’s becos they aren’t less matur.’ <br><br>And vid looked sad he was having much fun with jedi like a little boy meeting them long time dream from when found really old movie as child in other world. <br><br>(AN: Traveller sas that it is the future of or world so it is okay he know about Stir Wars! Not cultural contaminantion. When electronks get better eseir to save movie and story from now so it is not imposs with the technology theh can evn warp lite so don say there something they canned do.)<br><br>“Doant wore,” Nemedra say, “it si not relly a bad ting u like the jedi so mouch. It just is that if u drool when u look at Paddy then u will be given the no video and then only me and trask to finish mission.’<br><br>Slowly vid nodded sense ---<br><br>And then a stupid ignoramuse Wale who though he was PPC but relly was a Soo so deluged! Crash through seiling setting cannons on fire bcos he was destroyer of continuum. <br><br>Nemedra and Vid fill with bullets the wale and vid take out his lightsaber (nothing trask can do when wale flote in the air he very short even though he can jump pretty high he wait for land to tear it with claws) but nothing take! Jedi are running and blasting whal with lightning forse  everythin on fyre but is no good becos wale SIGHKICK and anyway too fat for elektrisiti to do much effect. Vid go running towards whale with lightsaber ---<br><br>Reiew if u want to read the rest! And if you though the last bit was stupid it is bcos someun who I will no name has ritten a su tat co into continumb an kill it set it on fyre. Yeh, I no stupid rite? But finally Nem has a su to kill on her way to su factry so tank u stupod uthor. Stuped ppl hav  uses after ell. <br><br>AN: Thank u v much to all my louvely revuers, u ar AMASING ppl and espetially thanks to LILLITH WEDENBROOKE who u all kno and who says she lieks my story go read hers they amazing then come back I may have new chapter becos the sue killing is too important to wait on revourrs. Did I menshon thanks go to LILLITH wEDENBROOKE who REVOUED MY STORY? Also I has lonely angle she is very nise and rites good.<br><br>((Guys. I am so sorry. Jopalopa, Lilly, my sincerest apologies, you’ve been “amasing” with this little charade… and I sincerely hope you don’t mind that my alter-ego is throwing your alter-egos around, all in the spirit of imitating suethors. I don’t know how they, or anyone else, does this. The sheer amount of energy in these little vendettas is astounding. Again, you guys and everyone else have been brilliant. Also, I know I just made a bunch of minis: I can’t decide if “Patty Amygdala” or “mase” is my favorite. -7s.)</p>

(I know thats not how the series goes but spike is a better vampir than edward lol at least he drinks blood,) and i think it would b rilly cute 2 hook Trask up w/ a dragon isn&#39;t there a blud elf agent w/ a dragon arund here somwher?<br><br>Du not wrry i plan to have lots ov awesum action w/ Trask an his velocoraptor acteeon, an w/ Vid &amp; Nemedra i think Nemedra could b reall y good frends with buffy if buffy &amp; Vid went on a date. Nemedra totes approoves of a chick who kills evil and stuff. </p>

            <p><i>AN: I typed this all up really fast because I am very ahppy to be part of this community yu guis ar the best and I wanna participate and give you all gifts for this faic axchange. So if there is grammer and spelling iassue I apologise.</i><br><br>So nemedra was waling downthe hall in the ppc after launch with her partner vid (AN: NO  they are not together they are just *PPC* partners even tho they are like family with trask) and she was really happ because the caf served real food that day in honor of the anerfersary of the battle that the Ppc won against the mieror vers sues. And she was passing the tomb of the uncknow ppc agent and thinkin how the battle never was one but the ware never would be as lon as sues existed and the sue factorees were still ther.<br><br>She an vid had once been solters and they wer in wars an stuff in the theird imperium when they were marins and so they knew a lot abot strategy and fighting and stuff and Nemedra was a very good shot and she and Vid also had been officers (an Lieutennans are officers right?) an d she was a trained in medicalso she had lots of experience and all of this very good reason she knew a lot about war even tho she hadn’t been ther when the war in the Pppc was fot. Also she was think about the macrovierus attaik but that only could happen once so it wasn’t so important the sues were a more threat. But that was why ppc wnt out into fix and terminated sues befor they could spread even one sue was very dangerous to a fandom she coupld infect all of it and make pieol e not do what they wer suppose to and change people minds and stuff but Nemedra was sure that no sue could give her influence becos nemedra was not made of written words like other agents and other characters in canon she had been a very special type of chara cter;roleplay. She and vid were not in danger from sues becos rolplay characters don’t have any hair and eye color or physical features until someone draws them (or until they show up @ the ppyc) and they have to do what the dice tells them and stuff. Therefor e if the sues invade again she was not worried about herself or about vid but about their velociraptor who was new partner Trask becos he came from a bookworld and bookworld characters were very skeptibal to influenza sues. Only Tv and movievorse chars were in moar danger from a sue becos of the hot actors and the microwave. <br><br>On this fine day Nemedra and Vid were talking and he was all like ‘hey I think we should get back before trask tears open the console with his claws probably we have another sue to kill lets hope she steals a script like the last one than we can loot items from canon because they have ben dopicated.’ And Nemedra laugh because trask is very nice gentle vilociratpor an he would never do that but Vid says things sarcastical and that is one of the things she best likes about her best friend army buddy. <br><br>‘I no I think we should get back but it too easy to get lost in Hqu because the walls don’t let you go anywhere you want.” Says nemedra and the two start concentrating really hard on what they had for breakfast so they can get to rc and get mission with Trask. But it doesn’t work. <br>Stupid wall vid says and hits it and then he is distracted by he stubbed his thumb so thay almost right away turn up at rc where the console beeps. <br><br>Trask come running up to them with fear in his yellow eyes and he says Vid you will not believe it Nemedra we do not have a juicy sue to kill we hahv  a ~crossover` and it is with firefly and with the star wars and I don know what firefly is or what is serenity.<br><br>They read summary and there is no MS there is only canons to excorcixe so they are not getting any loot this time. But they go into the word-world and almost immediately they nearly get run over by spaceship!!!, so now they are falling off building that they portaled to in crossover and towards ground!!!1<br><br><b>Hi guise I hope you like new chapter if I ever get to write Ppc for real vid and trask and nemedra will be my agents so iinteresting. Anyway I am evil so cliffie!!! And I will not post next chapter until I have a revou so put don’t be shy and write them down, chop chp! If u want to know how the intrsepid agents get out of this just leave me a line.<br><br>Oh, and iwill be putting in cannon characters later but since I don’t want anybody to mistake my agents for sues they aren’t going to be really in relationships or anything with the real important people like Acasia, Jay, Jaycacia, Suiceide, Noom (who is one of my favs,) Jenny or Chrissy and Ellie or that werepenguin guy or the other ones. This is becos I haven’t read the hole series yet and I don’t want anyone to be too different from what they really are unless I get a real evil plot bunny lol.<br><br>Also if you want to see a good show look up firefly and stuff you can totally find it for free if you look hard enough and it wa s canceled so getting it free totally isn’t piracy becos if they wanted to make money off it they shouldn’t have canceled. </b><br></p>

            <p>so 2 answer your last question first, Trask is from dinotopia an all the dinosaur talk in dat univers. It is a lenguage they shar with teh humans on theyre island and hq has the universal translatr thing.<br><br>mebbie i didn&#39;t explan that well but the thing about rolplay chars (good rolplay, not bad rolplay) is that ther universe is sue-resistent bcos rolplays have so many diffrnt DM&#39;s &amp; sorcebooks that sues don get powerful by compleatly wrecking canon bcos so much canon is decided by the individual DM. Also bcos rolplay usually isn&#39;t written down. So very little fanfic and not a lot of cannon chars. Not much 2 mess up. Nemedra is no ammune 2 sue ouran, but it is hardr to sue her than an agent from a book o movie bcos ther aren many sues in her home continuah. therfor ourange of smooth does nut no whut 2 do 2 make her sued.<br><br>i will explan more in deptht in next chappie, u r so smart 4 poinging out. Nemedra may hav gotten a little cocky after killing so many sues.<br><br>Ooh, an also next chappie is from Vid&#39;s POV, hope you like! I am so xcited for it! Also u get an cookie for being my first reveuer!</p>

            <p>Genre: Romance/Slice of Life Rating: T Summary: Merydel Lorliath an Cale are agents for the PPC but they also support love so theyre gonna help their friends Chrissie and Ellie find love<br><br>Ok so my freindsz told me too write clearer for you guys cause sometimesits hard too read my stuff when I dont use good grammer rite. I&#39;m capitaling my I&#39;s and evrything! Anyway major thanks to 2jelly221bjam! My beta is awesum!<br>   It was Merydel&#39;s first day at the PPC and she was really excited because she got to kill characters and stuff like that. She knew that it would be a great job because her friend Lorliath was there too and she was really good at it. She was the best rookie the PPC ever had because she had killed eight sues in one mission and she made out with a stu with River Songs&#39; lipstick and ge fell in love with her s she took him to the agency so they could study him but he wasnt a stu anymore so now they were dating. His name was Damon but now everyone calls him Dave (like Homestuck geddit?) <br> Merydel didn&#39;t have a boyfriend or a girlfriend cause she likes everyone and everyone likes her so she&#39;s totes open to anyone. She wears leather and dark lacy stuff cause she doesn&#39;t like bright clothes and so she decided not to wear them ever. “So Merydwl what&#39;s up?” An intern named Cale wound hang around the PPC sometimes and though she was a total jerk to everyone else she was friends wih Merydel cause Merydel saved her from Sherlock when he was being possessed an so now they are friends. Cale also helped her and Lorliath to try to help their friends have a relationship cause Chrissieand Ellie were obviously in love. “Oh nothing” Merydel said. “Good cause we need a plan” Cale said. “Yeah.” Merydel said because she already had a plan but she didn&#39;t want to hurt her feelings. Together they went to see Lorliath with their plan.<br><br>So what did ya think? Plz review!</p>

Stop it you too” Lorliath was really pretty she has blond hair that curls right blow her ears like Rose from Homestuck and Merydel looked just like Morgana from Merlin cept she has red hair and purple eyes because she has a disease that mens she doesn&#39;t get periods and she can see in the dark but she coud still have a babee if she wnted won. Cale was reely sad that Merydel and Lorliath were angry at here soshe sniffled a bit and followed them. Meanwhile Ellie and Christy are chiilling in there RC. Ellie was using the vaccum and Chrissie was msiling at her for being adoble and she thought &#39;maybe one day I&#39;ll be able to tell her my true fillings.” slowly she came behind her and rested her head on her shoulder. They began to sway around the room together and the other agents who wer watchin them were fangirling but then somethng horible hapened! There portal opened up and out of it steped the worst sue of them all!<br>Out came....................................................HERMIONE</p>

I am prepared to swear up and down that if I was ever this stupid, it was before the popularization of the internet.

            <p>She jus walks arund liek that its gross butt at least we saw Sherly&#39;s butt lol<br><br>((I feel ashamed to say that I nearly fell asleep during that episode. It just barely captured my attention, and it probably has a lot to do with the tone. It seemed to serve the purpose of enforcing the idea that Moriary uses a web, and shows us a glimpse on how Sherlock&#39;s vanity can be stroked to manipulate him. In other words, it was an infodump/clarification section that was masquerading as an episode in my view. I may be wrong though. I&#39;d have to review the entire series again of course. A few times. For science. Purely for science. It has nothing to do with a sheet. Science.))</p>

That comes from watching the first two seasons as a mini-marathon one weekend - I forget that they aren&#39;t one longer season instead of two mini-seasons. <br><br>I know it was only one scene, but it does feel like they purposefully overextended that scene in order to oversexualize her character. Meanwhile, they did a pretty poor job with the airplane (I&#39;m not sure what mind trick they were relying on to think that they would have won: if the world believed that the plane attack was real, then the terrorists <i>still</i> won because people are still afraid of them, and that was sort of the point,) and once they added the info-dumping in there simply wasn&#39;t enough time for that.<br><br>My other issue with that episode is the mood whiplash it gave me after the seriousness of the episode before that. Then, we get a new season (despite those of us who got the new season approximately five minutes and one bathroom break after the first season had finished playing,) and suddenly Irene is prancing about in the buff.)</p>

            <p>One day Riaa and Lana were eating cake together. <br>Lana said &quot;I dont know if I love you sometimes&quot;<br>And Rjooaaaa said &quot;But I love yous o much!!!!!!&quot; <br>And lan said &#39;but you have a spider body and thats kind gross we cant have secks.&#39;<br>And so rhiaaa was sad.<br>But lana said &#39;im going to go somewere.&quot;<br>and so Riaa was alone!<br> And she got into a relly low-cut dress and mad a circle and prayed to lolth!<br>&quot;I want to b a human girl so lana will luv me!&#39; she prayed to lolth. &#39;i was a humn girl before i can just do this rite?&#39; and so she made a pell to turn her into a normal girl jus  with white hair and stuff and she was about to cast it when SUDDENLY!!!!!<br><br>tge spell wnet somehwere else! and she ran and looked and suddenly she saw a new person who was a guy but a ttlly cute bishie wi wolf ears anna teail! And he waz where narav had been standing and lana was looking at im with hearts in her eyes! oh no! said rhiasdrhfamalamadingdong.<br><br>(And, within the PPC:<br>Narav sometimes was a bit annoyed at his heightened hearing. Sure it was useful for missions, and life in general, but some times...<br>&quot;Are you sure I can&#39;t have chocolate?&quot; asked a feminine voice.<br>&quot;No. It&#39;s a drug for your kind, even if being a drider weakens the effect. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s illegal,&quot; said the more familiar voice of his partner.<br>The other voice sighed. &quot;Aww...&quot;<br>&quot;Besides... we don&#39;t need that to have fun.&quot; Narav sighed and pushed through the door, trying not to not imagine the possibilities Lana and Riaa&#39;lzhor might have been exploring. He tossed a few sheets of paper on the floor in front of them.<br>&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; asked Riaa. &quot;Wait... what?&quot;<br>Lana snatched up the paper. &quot;Not--sweet lady of solder, what is this? I should think that I&#39;ve gotten over any uncertanties...&quot;<br>&quot;A low-cut-- I&#39;m showing my neck? Just--to everyone? How immodest!&quot; Riaa frowned. <br>&quot;I see your neck all the time,&quot; remarked Lana.<br>Riaa frowned. &quot;That&#39;s different. You&#39;re my girlfriend, so it&#39;s fine. And-- Lolth? From--Dungeons and Dragons? I was born this way! From a drawing, but it counts. Even if I have this many eyes, I&#39;m still a Ne&#39;kalsaider! I only worship Sharess, and I was never a dark elf! Or a human, or whatever this, ugh, FyreStarBlossom, wrote.&quot; She looked at Narav.<br>&quot;I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re not ranting about being turned into a bishie anthro-wolf-thing.&quot;<br>Narav gave a slow grin, showing all of his teeth. &quot;No. I&#39;m more interested in seeing the effects that blood from a Canim Sue will have.&quot; The others frowned for a moment, before starting to grin too.)</p>

About us? Who would do that?&quot; she squeaked.<br>Shaw frowned. &quot;But... we&#39;re hardly special. We were all side-characters. I mean, we do have some special abilities, but surely there&#39;s others.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, we should go take care of this!&quot; said Maia. &quot;We just have to go find a full set of agent gear and go kill the other us-es!&quot;<br>There was a small silence.<br>&quot;As much as I like killing things, you&#39;re an idiot.&quot; Kaede said flatly.&quot;)</i></p>

            <p>I read the JayBird bio and was morally offended when they posted that they were the CREYATOR  because one of the characters in my Specs and Co. series of mini-stories is known simply as The Creator, for lack of a way to cover up the fact that the Creator is a self-insert of, well, me. With god powers.<br><br>Hence why the Creator will never be an Agent! :D<br><br>NOTE: I was in no way offended by the JayBird bio.<br><br>DOUBLE NOTE: yes, I replied as my normal self against the rules.

            <p>A/N: Ummm wow its bean a long timme! Hop i remememember what I was writin!! Umm so this cahpter is an esperiment in SUSPENS.<br><br>*<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**<em>**</em>**_*<br><br>Chapter Three - Fear<br><br>Jaycacia awoke in the middle of the night, uncertain what had disturbed her. She tenderly lifted one of the SO&#39;s vines away from her soft skin and sat up, patting her hair to make sure it was still perfect (it was, of course). She was vaguely aware that she was still naked, but the night air was warm, and Jaycacia was extremely progressive about that sort of thing.<br><br>The forest glade was silent, lit by a silver moon and surrounded by dark trees. In fact, Jaycacia realised slowly, it was <i>too</i> silent. Where were the insects? The only sound was Jay&#39;s soft breathing.<br><br>Something moved in the forest, and Jaycacia gasped softly. It had barely been a shadow, a flash of black and deep red against the dark green of the trees, but it had been enough to set her pulse racing. She wondered whether she should wake her mother and husband - but no. There was no point exposing them to danger.<br><br>Standing, Jaycacia pulled on one of the soft robes the SO had provided for their holiday. It was black, with pastel pink trimming, and embroidered over her heart was the new symbol of the PPC - a stylised images of Jaycacia&#39;s own face. Her husband had wanted to make it a full-body portrait, but her mother had pointed out that not all the agents in the PPC were as progressive as Jaycacia, and he had relented.<br><br>Jaycacia walked across the soft grass towards the forest, when suddenly there was another movement behind her. She whirled, just in time to see the tail end of something the colour of fresh blood flash out of sight. Before she could process it there was a rustle off to the side, and she spotted what looked like a black-clad arm.<br><br>The sounds continued, and Jaycacia&#39;s mind sped. Things were clearly not well in the forest, and that arm (if it was an arm) suggested some of the people out there were from the PPC - probably the Department of Intelligence, who had always hated Jaycacia. That meant there would be at least twelve of them, and that meant...<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re surrounded!&quot; Jaycacia called out to the SO and Jay, who sat upright - and then...<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;Riddle me this: What do you call a kimono in Ancient Rome?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... anachronistic?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Got it in one. Hello, Jay.&quot;<br><br>Jay looked guilty for about as long as it takes light to cross a hydrogen atom, then beamed at her old friend. &quot;Acacia! Fancy-seeing-you-here!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, imagine,&quot; Acacia said dryly, putting down her tools and leaning on the counter. &quot;I&#39;m at work, Jay. Can it wait?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can </i>what<i> wait?&quot; Jay asked innocently. &quot;I could be here for a simple chat with my best pal in all the-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course I&#39;m not,&quot; Jay agreed, and held up a sheet of paper. &quot;It&#39;s-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, let me guess,&quot; Acacia sighed. &quot;The Sunflower is still trying to get us to kill that </i>Fifty Shades<i> thing, and now he&#39;s got a petition together to-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope,&quot; Jay said smugly. &quot;It&#39;s Jaycacia.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... it&#39;s <i>October</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, every month is Jaycaciamonth now!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And how long did you take to think up </i>that<i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;About two thousand years,&quot; Jay said, still grinning. &quot;In reverse. Got any tea?&quot;</i></p>

            <p>I was initially going to say there were too many characters MSTing this, but in the end, I think they all had about equal screen time, and I wasn&#39;t too confused about who was talking at any one time.  You did a good job of giving everyone a distinctive voice, so the dialogue doesn&#39;t feel interchangeable.  The two voices that felt the most similar were Nanoha&#39;s and Homura&#39;s, but I suppose they are very similar character archetypes, after all.  The fact that I&#39;m completely unfamiliar with both doesn&#39;t help me, either.<br><br>Also, near the middle, Sergio says, &quot;People doesn’t try to pair up other people,&quot; instead of, &quot;People <b>don’t</b> try to pair up other people.&quot;</p>

            <p>Going to fix that &quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; right now.<br><br>Homura and Nanoha are similar under some aspects. You DON&#39;T want to be the one who pisses either of the off, for example. Oh, and they&#39;re both voiced by Christina Vee in the English dub. (Although I don&#39;t like Vee&#39;s Nanoha peformance very much. It feels... off. Not Nanoha-like.)<br><br>However, they are fairly different characters, but a MST is not a place where the differences shine.<br><br>(Nanoha&#39;s usually quite cheerful, but you can&#39;t be that when you&#39;re assisting at the defilement of your characterization)</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>There exists a department in the PPC whose agents are so specialized in the lore of each Word World that none of them have to carry a C-CAD into the field. They move unseen, lurking in the background as they stalk their prey from afar. They are humble, professional, and most of all, efficient. They are completely and utterly focused on their tasks. They normally work alone, but are more than capable of teaming up to tackle uncanonical atrocities. They have the highest mission success rate out of all the departments and enjoy shortened work hours as well as a fairly decent dental plan with Medical.<br><br>These are not the people that are featured in these stories. In fact, that department doesn’t even exist. I mean, who gets dental around here?<br><br>These are the continuing adventures of an important yet obscure infrastructure department. Its Agents’ sole purpose in life is to sit down, read fanfiction (most of it bad), lose neurons, and enter Word Worlds in order to get a close-up look at whatever is going wrong... and resist the temptation to quietly throttle the offender.<br><br>Nobody ever talks about them. Names such as Elerossiel, Florestan, Supernumerary, Natacha, and Sorgebrunnen are often heard at the cafeteria or Rudi’s Pub, but ask anyone about Beydoun, Frost, San Lorenzo, or Mendel and you’re most likely going to get a “who?” in return. Maybe it’s because they don’t kill Sues. Maybe it’s because they’re not the ones directly involved in saving canon. Maybe it’s because nobody wants to hear about how Agent Patterson managed to pull twelve consecutive hours at a Sorting Room terminal without going mad (it involved two popsicle sticks, some yellow smiley stickers, and a can of sardines). <br><br>Well, no more of that. It’s time for the agents of the Department of Intelligence to get some time in the limelight. They may not be the bravest, the cleverest, or the most squick-resistant of the PPC’s agents, but they will get the job done even if they sometimes show signs of... <br><br><p><font size="6">(Un)Intelligence</font></p>
<br><p>A collection of short stories featuring the DoI<s>&#39;s best and brightest</s></p>
<br><br>- - - - -<br><br>So after several days of preparation, I’m proud to officially present (Un)Intelligence, a collection of short stories featuring everybody&#39;s favourite Spies (I think) and their friends. I plan to release these stories in mini-mission format on the Board similarly to what Huinesoron did with his latest DoGA mission.<br><br>I expect to be able to release a new episode every two Valve weeks*, and all episodes will be archived in a GDoc that I will set up on the DoI page on the wiki.<br><br>And with that being said, I would like to request a beta for the first episode. It’s a mere 4 pages clocking in at 1100 words and focuses on portal abuse in the Action Room.<br><br><br><br><br>*Yes, there will be an episode three. Honest.<br></p>

            <p>Greetings newbie, and welcome a-Board the good ship PPC. Please dispose of your sanity in the appropriately marked bin, as you wont be needing it here. As you have probably read the posts below, I would suggest you listen to them. Read everything, then chill, because there&#39;s a month-long waiting period until you can apply for Permission. Just relax and join in the discussion. Your fandoms are pretty popular around here, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find somebody to talk to. I myself am a fan of Hetalia and I&#39;ve been rereading the LotR series for the first time in ages.<br><br>As for your traditional newbie gift, I shall give you some SPaG candy. Keep a check on your grammar and enjoy!</p>
