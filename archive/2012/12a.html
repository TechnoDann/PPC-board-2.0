            <p>*deep breath*<br><br>I DID IT! :D<br><br>I did it kind of funky this year. I didn&#39;t finish the story i was doing last year (the story I&#39;ve been working on for way too long) so I picked up where I left off and finished it, then continued on the next installment. I made it in by a hair of 67 words on their word count validator, but 1,553 by MS Word&#39;s count. Here&#39;s hoping I do even better next year.<br><br>So who else participated?</p>

            <p>For me it was the professor who ran this creative writing seminar I attended last year who did the pushing. Only, she wasn&#39;t pushing the whole time; she just emailed me about it at the beginning of November because I&#39;d been the one to tell her this actually existed. Because of that, I started five days late. But I still made it!</p>

            <p>But I did make it to the 30k goal I had set for myself after Hurricane Sandy came and knocked out my power for two weeks. Even that makes me feel good, that I wrote and average of 1,000 words a day. <br><br>Plus, even if I had gotten to 50k I wouldn&#39;t have been done with the story. From now on I&#39;m just going to be working on it when I have ideas and not just to push out words. By the way I work I&#39;ll probably finish the first draft by March.</p>

            <p>The tensions between said new teacher and the three captains (and any other staff) are going to be very interesting, not to mention the escapades of the students. I am thinking particularly the TOS students, who, unlike the others, won&#39;t have the foreknowledge to keep back - and the tricks those students who do know might play on the TOS students (or even each other) in the name of beating the competition to their respective lust objects. Things like: &quot;You know where (insert L.O. here)&#39;s room is in the staff section, right? You see, it&#39;s just beyond those creepy green corridors...&quot; *Whistles innocently, knowing somebody&#39;s in for at least a good scare.*<br><br>Anyway, all in all, I&#39;m really looking forward to the next installment. Q vs the captains is hilarious, by the way. I wonder who will be teaching what, too. Good luck!</p>

            <p>... I like the way you&#39;ve dropped clues without actually telling the reader who it is yet. It gives a good bit of suspense, draws the reader in through speculating who it might be, and I reckon the shock of first seeing exactly who it is would be best served through the eyes of one of the students.<br><br>I also loved the captain&#39;s reactions, and not only because they were so in character. Kirk had better learn quick, too, else he could get into a few scrapes (but not as much as the students, of course).</p>

            <p>Now that you mention it...of the three of them, Kirk is my least favorite. So him getting into scrapes through his lack of knowledge...I would definitely enjoy writing that.<br>And I think I might have been too obvious with dropping clues, because someone already guessed. But then again, I&#39;m not telling him he guessed right. <br></p>

            <p>I had a thought: during my agents&#39; last mission, one of the misspellings they encountered was &#39;Buge&#39;. It created a mini, of course, but I reckon it also might have created something else.<br><br>In fact, I think it sounds something like rouge, the French for red, perhaps crossed with beige. Now, we all know what tends to happen with red in <i>Star Trek</i>, and I think you can guess what Buge was actually a misspelling of. So if red is a magnet for trouble and misfortune, I suspect Buge is a magnet for a particular kind of trouble - namely that which it is a misspelling of...<br><br>On a different note, and as a result of playing STO and starting reading HFA, I thought the Hirogen might be one good method of catching students trying to wander various places where they shouldn&#39;t (if drones and minis and security and whatever else weren&#39;t enough).</p>

            <p>I like the Buge idea. I mean, minis do that. In fact, I found a &quot;Sever of Mine&quot; that I thought could be interesting…<br>And sometimes misspellings create creatures that are not minis, simply because it would be funnier. Buge might be an example of that. Also the Bog Queen. And Clingons.<br>I&#39;ll keep the Hirogen thing in mind, but I&#39;m planning to put the Borg Queen&#39;s wing right in front of the staff section, so a fanbrat would have to be incredibly brave or incredibly stupid to try to go there.</p>

            <p>Well, don&#39;t forget teenage hormones have been known to create both incredible bravery and incredible stupidity. Still, I think it&#39;s a good idea, so long as the staff don&#39;t mind having to go through that wing as well (or have little choice in the matter thanks to Q).<br><br>Clingons could be a great way to slow people down, and this Bog Queen sounds like one very big and/or very dangerous swamp.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m back. As you can see. I&#39;ve done a lot of thinking, and writing, and thinking, and the like, and I finally decided on a few things: I&#39;ve revised Fix and the Carver, edited their Wiki pages and their missions and such accordingly, and I finally wrote my return piece. This is the one I spoke of previously, where avatar!me meets my agents. I know it&#39;s not amazing, but I do hope it&#39;s good. It&#39;s also a combination MST/interlude, because I couldn&#39;t get all the beforehand interactions into script form- at least, not in a form that would do them justice.

            <p>Thanks. :)<br><br>All of my agents are keeping tabs on me, but they also keep tabs on any references to them, which is how Ally knows about you volunteering to adopt Grace. Ally probably won&#39;t kill you, but she may be rather annoyed at the flagrant cyborg-discrimination going on.</p>

            <p>I remember TooManySecrets&#39; recruitment some months ago! It&#39;s very nice to see him again. <br><br>This is a very solid piece in my opinion. The action flows very well and the console / Luxury-related humour got some giggles out of me. The story length is perfect: neither too long or too short and gets its point across with no &quot;stagnent&quot; spots. I also like that tie-in with Huinesoron&#39;s Message. It&#39;s always nice to see other bits of HQ life being referenced in a spinoff.<br><br>I didn&#39;t get much of a feel for TooManySecrets&#39; character, though. His role in this short story was pretty much limited to &quot;beleaguered DoSAT techie has to work with Luxury breathing (a bit too close) down his neck&quot;, but then again, how else can any self-respecting agent behave around her? <br><br>Nitpick aside, excellent work. I look forward to seeing this DoSAT techie again.</p>

            <p>Just kidding!<br><br>It&#39;s a short little piece, but I enjoyed Luxury&#39;s, um, antics. My only concern though, is that TooManySecrets seems a little bit flat.

            <p>I once compared myself (in relation to the PPC) to the dude in college who parks himself on your couch, raids your fridge, and never leaves. Unfortunately, that metaphor can no longer be said to apply to me. I&#39;m done. Finished. Consider this post my resignation from the PPC.<br><br>“But PC!” I imagine you exclaiming (if you did no such thing, just play along). “Why? What brought this decision on?”<br><br>I&#39;m glad you asked (keep playing along).<br><br>One of my primary reasons is quality concrit, or more specifically, the lack thereof. I don&#39;t mean or want to sound like some spoiled fanbrat whining for reviews, but I need good concrit. I need analysis. I need people’s reactions. It&#39;s what makes me better as a writer. So single line responses or -- worse yet -- responses with no message whatsoever are ultimately useless to me. The PPC is supposed to be a community of writers. By extension, this means we are also supposed to be a community of readers, of editors, and of critics. But that&#39;s not what I&#39;ve seen. There’s been very little true “criticism” coming out of the PPC for some time now.<br><br>I also don&#39;t feel like I fit in anymore. It&#39;s not that I&#39;ve been actively made to feel unwelcome; many people are very polite and friendly. I do, however, feel a bit edged out. I can&#39;t connect with the newbies and I feel ignored by the old guard. Being alone is pretty bad. Being alone in a group is worse.<br><br>I&#39;m frustrated that there’s been no real change regarding the appointment of sorely-needed mods and the regulation of community behavior. I&#39;m annoyed with the same old cookie-cutter missions with the same old cookie-cutter agent archetypes. It feels to me like the PPC is stagnating.<br><br>But most of all? I&#39;m tired. I’m tired of writing stories that almost no one reads and almost no one cares about. I&#39;m tired of the cliques. I&#39;m tired of the anarchic literary playground. I&#39;m tired of the same hyperbolic “ohmigawd this is the worst fic ever KILL IT NAOW” reactions.<br><br>The PPC just isn&#39;t fun any more. <br><br>I wish this didn&#39;t have to be the case. There are still so many stories with Danny, Laura, Gremlin, and Xericka still rattling around inside my brain. Leaving with those stories left untold feels wrong -- a disservice to my characters. But it would be an equal disservice to them to keep writing when my heart isn&#39;t in it anymore. They deserve better.<br><br>I loved my time with the PPC, and I still do believe that it has improved my writing tremendously. For that, I owe the community much. But I want to keep improving, and I don&#39;t think I can do that here.<br><br>Many thanks to my assorted betas and editors, especially doctorlit, who read through the vast majority of my pieces. Kudos to you, good sir. Also many thanks to those who&#39;ve been following my stories. I&#39;m sorry that I won&#39;t be able to keep going.<br><br>Adios and farewell.<br><br>PoorCynic<br><br><i>“Excuse me then! you know my heart;<br>But dearest friends, alas! must part.”</i></p>

            <p>I think we can all agree that no place is perfect. The thing is, putting up with imperfections can only go for so long, and eventually one either attempts to make a change, or leaves (or sinks into sulky acceptance, but that&#39;s another story). Given that we all love the PPC, and we want it to flourish and continue, I ask you: How do you think the PPC can improve, and what changes need to be made? If we suggest things, and discuss those suggestions, then hopefully we can co-ordinate and create changes.<br><br>I personally agree with PoorCynic that we need more mods- and also that in a way, the missions are stagnating. With everyone following close to the same archetype, it&#39;s hard to find new enjoyment when you&#39;ve read similar things dozens of times, so perhaps we need to shake up the formula slightly. What do you think?</p>

            <p>So, this is less PPC-focused and more we-should-write-goodfic! focused. My idea is this: A bunch of fanfic cowrites. Essentially, each Boarder who wants to partake puts their name on a list, along with their top three or four fandoms (probably not more than that) Then, they&#39;re randomly matched up with another Boarder, with no fandoms in common, and then they write a crossover fic between the two canons.  Or, you could suggest a fandom to crossover with, so long as you don&#39;t know much about it other than it looks cool. It&#39;d be a good way both to introduce people to new canons, and help Boarders have fun with people they don&#39;t normally write with.<br><br>For example, I&#39;d like to see, say a Nanoha/Sherlock crossover. Maybe Sherlock starts poking at a Lost Logia that&#39;s been causing inexplicable (ie magical) murders around town, and Fate, the Enforcer who has to deal with the Logia, has to deal with it and him. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m very, very sorry to see PC go, and I hope he knows he&#39;ll be missed - very much so. (I&#39;m not good at goodbyes. I tend to put them off until the very last. It&#39;s not... a lack of empathy.) But I&#39;m agreeing with Neshomeh that a big attempt to Change Everything is not what we need, and with Data that... well, a big attempt to Change Everything is not what we need.<br><br>But the metaphor here that I&#39;m looking for is similar to Phil Plait&#39;s (and others&#39;) commentary on the Race To The Moon. If our focus is one big push, it&#39;s a huge... well, push, that quickly peters out, trails off, and gets forgotten about. As said above/below-thread, this has happened multiple times - usually either in the wake of Drama or Exit, or sometimes Dramatic Exits. But adding mods isn&#39;t going to prevent people from leaving - or rather, it may prevent some people from leaving, while pushing others towards leaving. (Personally, I should note this is a sore spot for me; last time I tried to push for mod-reform, someone left as a result of that.) I don&#39;t want to see that happen again.<br><br>I&#39;d also say that putting up with imperfections goes on forever. We&#39;re human - we are imperfect. All of our efforts will be flawed, even those with the greatest intentions. We cannot be a community of humans and provide everyone with exactly what they want/need in a community. It&#39;s just not possible. I think what we&#39;ve achieved here, though, is pretty cool. I&#39;m biased, obviously, and I do think we could (as always) stand to improve. But as Huinesoron and Neshomeh have said, the way to do that is to work towards being a better community ourselves - the PPC Community<sup>TM</sup> is a useful abstraction, but it&#39;s made up of humans - of us, to be specific - and I think it helps to remember that.</p>

            <p>It did, a little, to be honest. I&#39;m not trying to change everything. I just thought that with many people complaining that the PPC wasn&#39;t fun any more, and that it was becoming stagnant, that I should actually do something instead of just thinking that I should do something, and try to make it fun again. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see what the big deal is, really.  Not that I&#39;m opposed to people doing things, but why make it this big important &quot;oh we need to do something new to save the community&quot; thing. As Nesh points out, we&#39;ve done this a dozen times before. Things come of it, sometimes, but they don&#39;t last, which is okay, because it doesn&#39;t really matter. People are going to leave eventually anyway, and new people will join, people will stay in touch with the friends they&#39;ve made and old people will come back, even if it&#39;s just for a while. It&#39;s how communities work. Why not just let stuff like crossovers and RP happen naturally, instead of having this big push for it?<br><br>If people want to see things done, instead of going &quot;Hey, we should do something, maybe x?&quot; and having an endless conversation, why not just /do/ it? <br>You wanna see more RP? Make one, then. Set it up on the other board, advertise it here, and have at it.<br>Want to see more crossovers? Best way to do that is to partner up with people and write really good crossovers so that other people will get interested.<br>Want to see more stuff that falls outside of the usual mission format? Write it and they will come!<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is chill, folks. It&#39;ll be alright. We don&#39;t need to make it a huge issue every time someone leaves.</p>

            <p>Mainly because I wanted to put the premise of trying lots of new stuff out there. While it&#39;s true that people would think of new things on their own, bringing as many people as possible into a conversation about it gives more people an opportunity to find ideas and premises that they like, and thus the chance that these new things would actually occur grows bigger.<br><br>Also, while it would be a lie to say that PoorCynic&#39;s departure had nothing to do with this, it wasn&#39;t the sole reason.

            <p>What can you—the person reading this right now—what can <i>you</i> do to make the PPC a better place?<br><br>&#39;Cause I&#39;m here to tell you, we&#39;ve done this song and dance after somebody leaves many times, and it rarely, if ever, pays off in the long term. The reason is that &quot;we&quot; usually ends up meaning &quot;somebody else,&quot; or &quot;I will if everyone else does.&quot; There&#39;s a period of discussion, like what&#39;s going on right now, and suggestions are made, and lots of people go &quot;yeah, that&#39;s a great idea!&quot;, and maybe one or two even do something different one time. But then everything goes back to normal again, because no one wants to be in charge, and without leadership the incentive for doing things differently quickly fades away on an individual basis.<br><br>Now, PC is a guy who led by example about the things he values. He gave concrit; he strove to make his missions unique and fresh and interesting; you never saw him flip out at the latest badfic; etc.<br><br>So, how about you? What can YOU do?<br><br>Do you want to see more concrit around here? Make a commitment to give more. Do it. Keep doing it.<br><br>You want varied mission styles? Maybe you should try writing for a department that isn&#39;t Floaters or the DMS. There are <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Departments">scads of them</a>, you know, most virtually untouched. Lots of room to play around with mission styles there—or, should you venture into the rarefied airs of PPC Infrastructure, your stories needn&#39;t even be missions at all.<br><br>Want more group interaction? RP, perhaps?

Go start something! There shouldn&#39;t need to be a frelling emergency for agents to get together and hang out. As for co-writes, they don&#39;t need to be ridiculously huge, either. Back in Ye Olden Dayes, writers used to team up to PPC, one agent apiece. Try it!<br><br>Want more moderation?

            <p>Apparently I basically agree with everything in here that I know anything about. ;)<br><br>I actually don&#39;t, mostly, agree with the Astral Void/PoorCynic view of the PPC - I think that&#39;s because I write PPC stories primarily for the sheer enjoyment of writing them, rather than  because &#39;I need good concrit. I need analysis. I need people’s reactions.&#39; To each, her own.<br><br>I do, however, agree and wholeheartedly repeat what Neshomeh says: if you think something needs doing, do it. Write the interesting missions (and please, for the love of little green dragons, <i>stop making every agent a Floater</i>!). Don&#39;t hang around waiting for someone else to &#39;fix&#39; whatever you think is wrong with the community (which is what &#39;We need mods!&#39; comes down to, guys) - go talk to whoever&#39;s doing something wrong. If you are nice about it, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">remember the Constitution</a> - and don&#39;t follow someone around the Board nitpicking their every move, I only just got away from someone who did that at work and it was Not Nice - you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble.<br><br>Because that intangible, immaterial, ideal PPC Community isn&#39;t any of those things. It&#39;s you. And it&#39;s me. And it&#39;s Neshomeh, and it&#39;s Penguin Yaoi, and it&#39;s everyone in between. A community that runs itself only works if the <i>members</i> of the community do the running.<br><br>So go out and do it. I&#39;m going to act on my own suggestions elsewhere on this thread - because I think it&#39;ll be fun.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That was just the thing that most struck me from your combined posts; fear not, I still disagree with you about everything else, too. :P I don&#39;t think the (few) missions I read are particularly stagnant, and I don&#39;t think we need any form of mods.<br><br>But that was my whole thesis: who cares what I think? Who cares what you think? Who cares what anyone thinks? This is the PPC - if you see something that you think could be done better, do it better. Don&#39;t sit around waiting for someone else to do it better for you.<br><br>This isn&#39;t a specific accusation at you, AV. It&#39;s actually, I suppose, an agreement with you: &#39;putting up with imperfections can only go for so long, and eventually one either attempts to make a change, or leaves&#39;.<br><br>What I get from your post is that you want people to get moving and make changes - rather than sinking into sulky acceptance. You took the step of making a thread about the problems you percieve rather than just sitting back and tutting, and I respect that. I just don&#39;t want anyone else - not the oldbies, not the newbies, not <i>any single member of our community</i> - to look at this thread and go, &quot;I totally agree with Astral. I&#39;m glad someone&#39;s doing something about it. Now I&#39;ll stop thinking about it.&quot; That&#39;s not how the PPC <i>works</i>.<br><br>So, you! Any person who is reading this and thinking, &quot;Wow, everyone&#39;s making such good points, I&#39;m glad someone&#39;s doing something about this.&quot;! Go and join in one of the two RPs above - or go give someone concrit - or go write a really interesting story - or, whatever it is you think <i>other people</i> need to do... <i>go and do it</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, there&#39;s four reasons.<br><br>1/ It&#39;s one of the PPC&#39;s newest department. I think Temporal Offences post-dates it, but that&#39;s about it. So fewer of us have read it.<br><br>2/ It&#39;s one of the department I created, and people tend not to write in those. That&#39;s not just about me - most of the departments that came about after Jay left have only one writer. The exceptions that I can think of are DOGA (and even there, the first non-me writer specifically asked my permission) and the DIA (which was written by Artemis, languished for a long time, then had a resurgence with Crashing Down; a few people have written for it since). Oh, and the Floaters.<br><br>I actually (mostly) disagree with this state of affairs. If someone wants to write for WhatThe, or Technical Errors, or Out-Of-Character Hobbits - well, they&#39;re departments in the PPC now, so people should be able to. The DOOCH&#39;s creator is long gone, and I don&#39;t mind people using WhatThe - don&#39;t know about Araeph and the DTE, though.<br><br>3/ (Are we on 3?) I never wrote very much in WhatThe. They have <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">three missions</a>, pretty much. So there&#39;s nothing to stick in people&#39;s minds and make them go &#39;Hey, I wanna do that!&#39;<br><br>4/ The reason I haven&#39;t written much... it&#39;s <i>hard</i> to find genuine WhatThe stories. They aren&#39;t the ones which squick you out (that would be Bad Slash or DAVD, depending on how they do it), or the ones with extraordinarily bad grammar (DTE), blatant Sues (DMS), etc etc. They&#39;re the ones that are <i>really out there</i> - such as, well, writing all the dialogue in English and Gaelic, making your lust object be Maedhrosified!God, or sending your Sue up against the Black Knight (because, well, it&#39;s Monty Python. Just no).<br><br>But I read less and less fanfic these days. If you know of some stories that deserve the WhatThe treatment - take &#39;em down! Mortic and Elanor could use the company.<br><br>Actually, if anyone wants to write their agents transferring to WhatThe, I will gladly drag the old team out and cowrite a first mission. I think that department needs a hand-hold (for the agents, not the writers).<br><br>hS, good grief it&#39;s been ages since I cowrote with anyone</p>

            <p>I might have one to start with.<br><br>If you&#39;ll recall - unless you didn&#39;t read that topic, in which case I shall explain - I discovered the Sue Colors Whirple and Pilver in what I simply called, &quot;A Tales of Vesperia fic&quot;.<br><br>That fic, specifically, was a Vesperia fic that had a plot which screamed &quot;New World Order Rebellion Attempt&quot;.<br><br>Except, uh, it was an attempt to overthrow the New World Order in favor of the Old World Order, which was a direct threat to the very existence of the planet and had to be discarded for three greater good of existence.<br><br>Add a Stu straight out of The World Ends With You, and that&#39;s already trouble.<br><br>Initially, I was going to use it as a first fic for Specs and Sef, but when I got the no-sir-ee there, I just kept it in my files for &quot;just in case&quot;.<br><br>So, a possibility presents itself.

            <p>People - new people - come here (or at least used to) because they enjoy Jay and Acacia&#39;s stories and want to write things like them.

The Departments have changed, the mission formats have changed, everything has changed - but it&#39;s still the PPC.<br><br>So. If people want to start writing missions in <i>that</i> time-period - or, indeed, the period of the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndOn.htm">Department of Efficiency</a>, or any of the periods involved in Origins-Lofty Skies-Reorg-Crashing Down (<a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/">these</a>), I&#39;m willing to a) officially open them up, and b) write up a summary of what I have sketched out (as a basis for people to work from).<br><br>I&#39;m not suggesting this would, should or could replace current missions - but it could be a way to vary the writing and reading experience. Tired of writing Assassins? Write yourself a Demas Paladin. Fed up of DoSAT? Go visit the Technomancers on their flying city! Etc etc.<br><br>Were this to happen, I would suggest starting with an RP-type emergency: something involving timeslips (presumably from the Seventy Plus era to the present), because toying with the fabric of reality is endlessly entertaining.<br><br>Oh, and there&#39;s still <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1v4HKVdLZu_lfjnh29fja1kfYK67qqFGIftwPTvagmFw">a message</a> going round the system.

            <p>I had ideas about my agents in the future - Riaa and Narav are both incredibly long-lived, but maybe Ari is in the Library, now the admin program of the Tome of Morning Sky, providing security and random advice until a Nanoha-verse mage with the right skills can come and use the Tome. <br></p>

            <p>Of course we&#39;re still going to have to keep the Original Series mission format; that is the tried and true one, after all. <br><br>I view the J&amp;A-style mission as the standard mission, obviously, but if we took a look into the various genres of literature and fanfiction out there we can ascertain that not all of them play by the same plot (unless you&#39;re in the circle of lemmings). By that same token, writers for the PPC should at least have the flexibility to be able to branch into different genres and to try out new mission formats. It doesn&#39;t have to be ironclad standard - it just should be an option.<br><br>Also, wouldn&#39;t that lead into your 60 years later sort of PPC? There&#39;s no way we can jump from now to then without a transition period where people start changing mission formats, after all. I&#39;d love to test out the new timeline eras myself.<br><br>Weren&#39;t we a couple threads back discussing the various PPC AUs - the steampunk one, the pirates one, the magical girl one - as well as scenarios where Agents are paired with minor canon characters? I&#39;d like to see some of those written out. And perhaps we could toy with the Intern programme which seems to have a grand total of one member - that&#39;d be a good avenue for those still without Permission who want to spork things in a co-write. </p>

            <p>I also remember that another reason for the ban on Emergencies is that they were happening too often, and someone pointed out that when the PPC HQ is invaded by hordes of Sues on a regular basis, the Emergencies stop being actual emergencies and become something more commonplace.<br><br>What might be fun is more HQ-wide RP sessions. I&#39;m not saying churn out one once a week or anything, just every now and then it&#39;d be nice if we could all pool together our agents and have them, I don&#39;t know, deal with a rabbit stampede or a sudden HQ-wide ponification or something. In fact, they don&#39;t even need to be RPs. The mass Halloween scary story co-write last year? That was fun! As was Huinesoron&#39;s fourth-wall-breaking co-write (has that been concluded yet? I may have missed some of it.)<br><br>PC mentioned cliques, and people not being able to relate to other people within a group as large as the PPC. This will not do. It&#39;d be nice to have more chances to interact with fellow Boarders, and a nice and productive way that everyone, no matter what fandom, can participate is discussions and group projects that are PPC-related in general.</p>

            <p>About cliques.<br><br>They&#39;re really not an issue.<br><br>You&#39;re going to get cliques in <i>any</i> group of more than twenty people, let alone in a group the size of the PPC.  People are <i>always</i> going to gravitate more towards people they&#39;re more comfortable with.  It&#39;s an inevitable part of interaction in groups.  It&#39;s not worth getting worked up about, since no matter what happens, most people are going to want to hang out/work with their friends, and pretty much the only way around that is to force them to, y&#39;know, not do that.

            <p>Maybe we could do another Fandom Buffet? Because it seems to me that people who know a bunch of stuff about video games gravitate towards each other, and people who know a lot about anime gravitate towards one another as well. So, if the two groups interacted, new friends could be made!</p>

            <p>Gravitation aside, a story&#39;s a story - and I think in the IRC and &#39;Board alike, there&#39;s a constant mingling of fandoms.

            <p>I agree, the groups of people who know blah blah fandom are a bit... Off-putting. For people like me, who are - to quote TV Tropes - Jacks of All Trades when it comes to vacations, good but not great at many things, it&#39;s a bit like you&#39;re the third wheel that doesn&#39;t fit in anywhere.<br><br>I&#39;ve been there. I AM there in real life, even.<br><br>What I&#39;ve also noticed is that certain members seem to respond more openly to some boarders than others. I try to make myself an open person to all members here, but I have this issue as well, where I&#39;ll get to talking with somebody, and then somebody will interject their opinion, and I&#39;ll just completely blow them off. I think there should be a greater effort to be welcoming and friendly all the time, and not just when introducing yourself to newbies.<br><br>Friendships are fine, but one of the rules of this site, if not stated then implied, is that all opinions are welcomed, and all conversion should be taken with a smile rather than a smirk.

            <p>Firstly, we need more things to link each spinoff to another. Co-writes, RPs, references to another PPCer&#39;s work, agent cameos, you name it, we need more of them. Right now I feel that each department is self-contained and agents don&#39;t see much of their coworkers from other branches. I realize that this is hard to pull off in a mission where the badfic is centre stage but I think acknowledging other PPCers&#39; work makes the entire universe <i>that</i> much more alive.<br><br>Secondly, write more concrit. I wholeheartedly agree with PC when he says that there isn&#39;t enough constructive criticism going around: just saying &quot;I liked it!&quot; doesn&#39;t help an author improve. What did you like in the mission? Why? What was your favourite part? Why? Were there any passages that felt forced, slow, or awkward? Point them out and explain. <br>I suggest that for every mission that we read, we should write a review.<br><br>Thirdly, let&#39;s talk Emergencies. On the up side, they have certainly changed the formula of day-to-day life for agents by placing them into extraordinary situations where nobody-- perhaps not even their author-- knows how it will end. They have always spurred change in the PPC-verse and kept things fresh by involving agents from every single service branch. The down side is just that: some changes are not wanted. Makes-Things&#39; &quot;death&quot; is the prime example of this situation. <br><br>I have been reviewing the discussion following Huinesoron&#39;s release of his Swan&#39;s Egg stories and it is clear that the death of important characters-- especially those that are free-to-use-- is something to be avoided at all costs when writing about a crisis. The moratorium on Emergencies was established to prevent such a thing from happening again.<br><br>But what if we set up safeguards? Rules to prevent something that would cripple or radically change the structure and workings of the PPC? In theory, we could write Emergencies <i>responsibly</i> by establishing what we can and cannot do with the PPC. Naturally, we will have to establish a rule on the frequency of such events (like maybe a general vote on whether we could write about one). <br><br>If a consensus could be reached, I think this could inject some life into the community.<br><br>...but that&#39;s just my opinion. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>Seconded the concrit bit. It is my chief complaint in all creative expression settings.<br><br>And to the emergency thing: while the Permission system is something I totally agree with, maybe the emergency could be like an alternative? Rookie potential agent walks into PPC for a conference or Aldrich, and suddenly finds themselves wrapped up in a crisis that could determine whether they actually take the job, or end up waiting until peace is had to try again, or something like that?<br><br>Obviously, there would be TONS of details to work out, and restrictions and all that, but maybe it could work as a sort of change from the current system from those who want to change things up a bit? <br><br>(I&#39;m not part of this group - I&#39;m actually working on a second attempt using the current system - but it&#39;s a potential idea that might end up flying or flopping that I think could be considered.)</p>

            <p>I rather realised it with the latest one I wrote where my Agents seemed rather bored doing it.

            <p>I tested it out for the Badfic Game with the PPC Sherlock AU - in a murder mystery format, I suspect that the Words would have to be inaccessible because then the Sue would be easily found - but what I had in mind was:<br><br>The console beeps; the Intel Report only gives a dossier on the victim (whether that&#39;s the canon as a whole or a canon character in particular) and a list of suspects; the Agents go into the fic and observe the canons, interview suspects (all the OCs/bit characters), find evidence of canon-tampering (whether that&#39;s from a haywire CAD, a spatial-temporal distortion, or the complete frick-up of the surroundings/whatnot). The Agents eliminate the impossible, come up with the suspect that is the Sue, and trap the Sue somehow (catching them red-handed, direct confrontation to wrangle a confession, whatever). They then charge and assassinate the Sue.<br><br>Are there potential plot problems with that? I&#39;m going to try it out on my next mission, so if there&#39;s a glaring problem now I&#39;d like to get it fixed before I accidentally make a huge plothole in-mission.</p>

            <p>... I was already tempted to have a Star Trek mission where my agents have to take the Sue/Stu on in a ship-to-ship battle. Also, they do have a ship (from my latest mission), which Sigma is currently - upgrading - with the help from various generic DoSAT technicians.<br><br>It has occurred to me that some of these Sues are quite powerful, and would potentially put up more of a fight than necessarily given credit for. That, and it would be more exciting. That&#39;s also why my agents got chased by the Canons after defeating the Stu in their last mission - in fact, I found that as much fun as mocking the bad spellings.<br><br>I also plan to have some interludes soon, which should break the formula and expand on happenings in HQ.</p>

            <p>Thompson&#39;s ship, I presume? Well, if you needed any help, I bet the &#39;Stu&#39;s face would be a picture if he saw the future version of his own ship (especially after Sigma&#39;s &#39;redecoration&#39;). I&#39;m sure Sigma would let you borrow it, if your agents asked. You might want avoid mentioning the name Captain Jack Russel, though, unless you wanted a certain trio tagging along.<br><br>Oh, and at least you already have a good permission piece, namely OFAS. That&#39;s the hardest part. You also already know what you want to spork. I can see you getting permission fairly easily, after the month&#39;s up (it might be already). The real question is whether you think you&#39;ll have the time for writing both missions and OFAS. If so, then go for it!</p>

            <p>I agree about the missions; that there&#39;s even a &#39;starter formula&#39; listed on the Wiki&#39;s Guide to Writing Missions page has always kind of bothered me. But I also think the formula issue is a double-edged sword: on one hand, formulas tend to stagnate after a few minutes, but on the other hand, formulas can serve to give newer PPCers a sort of cheat sheet until they find their own flow.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking that more group missions might help break up the monotony a bit - I admit, I prefer writing solo missions (and feel relatively safe in assuming others do as well), but if we&#39;re meant to be a community of writers, and not just a group of hilariously insane badfic killers, it strikes me as odd that there aren&#39;t more group missions. I&#39;m not saying we need another emergency (we don&#39;t), but it seems to me that it wouldn&#39;t hurt to have a few group mission challenges - or something similar - scattered at odd intervals throughout the year.<br><br>I also think that changing the way missions are written should first and foremost be the choice of each individual writer, and <i>not</i> an enforced community edict. To me, telling someone, &quot;You have to write it following this sequence of events&quot; is a bit like saying, &quot;You can be creative, but you have to use the same basic framework as everyone else.&quot;<br><br>Yes, I realize the formula is more of a suggestion than an outright order, and I&#39;m not trying to accuse anyone of &#39;stifling our creativity&#39; or &#39;make us all their little writing slaves&#39;; nor am I trying to stir up or create any conspiracy theories among the Board. I just really think that we need more than one formula and that, formulas or no, we should respect each writer&#39;s decision to follow the same tried and true formula or to try something new, as it suits them.<br><br>As for the mods, I honestly think we have plenty. There always seems to be at least one around at any given point in time, and appear to be doing a good job as is. Besides that, I worry that having more mods will cause done of us - without naming names - to think the Board is becoming more repressive, and that a rift may begin to appear among us as a result.</p>

            <p>My disagreement is minuscule though. I do believe that the &#39;tried and true&#39; method can be used, by oldbie or newbie, as long as you add some sort of unique spice to it. This is most likely the characters, but it can also be the way the &#39;Sue is portrayed to act and react, or how the assassination is carried out. You don&#39;t need to go completely outside the norm for variety.   <br><br>I do agree greatly with the group missions though, despite my lack of experience in the field in general. The only PPC thing that I&#39;ve written that has been approved and published as the Rouge Angles of Satin MST, but I have to say it was a ton of fun, bouncing people&#39;s comments and ideas off each other, as well being able to show interaction that normally wouldn&#39;t happen. That also goes along with the idea that missions are somewhat self-contained. You really don&#39;t see people referencing each other&#39;s works, making the PPC appear less like a community and more like a bunch of secluded individuals with the same bosses. I feel like group missions would help relieve that somewhat, but also just mentioning other agents or events. All you have to do is nudge a person and say &quot;Hey, do you mind if I mention X or Y in my story?&quot; If they say no for whatever reason, leave their things alone. If they say yes, you&#39;re free to go. That way it looks like everybody actually knows each other and has shared horror stories with each other, like a community.<br><br>In other words, work together more and we&#39;ll look more like a community. </p>

            <p>...but on REALLY bad badfics - like C*l*br**n or &#39;Replacement Dash destroys my faith in the inherent innocence of humanity&#39; - writing in a group makes it easier to maintain one&#39;s sanity.

            <p>I might suggest, at least to start, that while the GDoc system that&#39;s been adopted is very applicable, it is difficult to get used to if you are coming in to it with no knowledge of the system. <br><br>For me, I recently got done with a big email-based beta of a badfic. It was one huge brainstorming period between at least ten boarders, including myself, and we all bounced ideas off of each other that were built on, debated, discarded, applied, or tossed around. With each new factoid about the fic, dozens of new ideas sprung up for us to toy with. It was all kinds of fun.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying &quot;Ragh Ditch GDoc&quot;, because I got burnt while trying to handle it on my phone. That&#39;s unfair of me to do. But, I would like to suggest that maybe more of these email brainstorms could be applied to fics before big group-writes on GDocs. I&#39;m just thinking it might do wonders towards improving the already good quality of stories, and it would give boarders a good idea of how other boarders think, and thus give a good impression as to the styles of their cohorts for any future group writes where those particular people might want to join in.<br><br>It would also help to encourage friendly discussion and debate between intelligent minds, as well as make friendships where there might have been assumed shyness, especially for newbies. In fact, for newbies, it would be a good experience with improving their styles, and getting a wide mass opinion as to how many ways you can write a good story and keep the audience interested.<br><br>Hey, it&#39;s just a thought, but it&#39;s one I&#39;ve been considering for a while.</p>

            <p>Before our co-writes, Intel and I would actually liveblog the fic we were sporking on Tumblr (you can still find them under the &quot;lily vs suefics&quot; tag on my Tumblr), corroborate our biggest complaints and snarkiest comments in private messaging, and open a GDoc to write the mission itself.<br><br>GDocs is really annoying in mobile format, yeah.

            <p>Perhaps it is due to a difference in writing style, but I like the GDocs method (I&#39;m also writing on a 15&#39;6&#39;&#39; laptop, so I don&#39;t have size problems).

            <p>Official Fanfiction University of Azeroth!<br><br>I am in the planning stages for it. I already have a <b>location</b> that can be reached without needing to buy any expansions (the Stonetalon Mountains, which remain mostly neutral and are lore-wise expansive enough to <i>hide</i> a community of Pandaren in); a <b>two-house idea</b> (Horde students to the right, Alliance students on the left); a few <b>teachers and classes</b> picked out (Koltira Deathweaver and Thassarian will have a one-semester course titled something like &#39;Across the Line: Writing a Believable Interfaction Friendship&#39;; Anduin Wrynn will teach &#39;Difficult Parents and How to Handle Them&#39;; Sylvanas Windrunner will teach &#39;Vengeance for Imbeciles&#39;, with guest instructor Maiev Shadowsong offering a two-week seminar on hunting down your prey to the ends of this world and every other world he runs to); and I have the <b>application form</b> almost worked out.<br><br>Why am I posting all this now? The answer is quite simple: <i>I have no idea what I&#39;m doing and seriously need at least one or two co-writers to help me out.</i> I have never attended any school higher than high school (not so surprising, this is my first year out of high school), have no idea how to work out class titles, and would really appreciate some help with things like scheduling, vacations, field trips, semesters, etcetera, etcetera, ad nausium. If no one&#39;s willing to co-write, can I at least get some people to whom I can turn for advice or ideas? Heck, I&#39;ll even take pointers posted as responses to this thread!<br><br>Not giving up on this no matter what,<br>KittyNoodles</p>

            <p>You seem to have gotten some advice already, but here&#39;s what I&#39;d recommend:<br><br>- Use your fandom for inspiration. Most of the plots from OFUM were related to fanfic trends and stuff like that.<br>- Keep it funny or you run the risk of getting too much on a soap box.<br>- While OFUM is quite episodic in form, some long-term plots and arcs help make it feel more coherent. Don&#39;t be afraid to refer to past events and have some character development (especially for the main character). <br>- Don&#39;t try to cop OFUM too much. Seriously, I think the more successful OFUs are the ones who adapted the idea the most to their fandom. I tailored OFUM for LotR - don&#39;t just take elements of it and put it in your OFU. Adapt it as much as possible.<br><br>And good luck! (I play WoW, so extra luck in fact.)</p>

            <p>I was the one who suggested to Kitty she read OFUs for inspiration. I&#39;m not copying (at least, I hope not) but a lot of how to <i>write</i> an OFU--creating a believable yet relatable fanbrat main character, how to show your course coordinator interacting with canons without making her Sue-y (I always watch my self-inserts very carefully), how to show the fanbrat interacting with the canons realistically, the overall tone of it. <br>And overall writing skills, because reading goodfic helps you write goodfic. And OFUM is not legendary goodfic for nothing.</p>

            <p>Thrall might be better used somewhere else, actually.  Maybe a comparative religion course.<br><br>Now, if you are looking for a good geography teacher, look no further than <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Brann_Bronzebeard">Brann Bronzebeard</a>, High Explorer of the Explorers&#39; Guild.

            <p>Thrall is an interesting character.  He was a major part of the effort to unite the Horde and the Alliance to bring peace and understanding to Azeroth.  Then he left to keep the world from tearing itself apart after Deathwing borked the whole thing.

            <p>And I felt the same way when I started, and I didn&#39;t have the PPC community. So I had to do the research on my own (finding the PPC in the process). <i>Still</i> doing the research, in fact.<br>Some things I&#39;ve figured out that might help:<br>-Read OFUs. I looked up every OFU I could find in fandoms I recognized. I&#39;ve read both OFUM and HFA multiple times, and there were already some (abandoned) attempts at a Star Trek OFU so I read those too. Take inspiration from them.<br>-Read misscam&#39;s rules for writing OFUs. They&#39;re on her website.<br>-Come up with an overarching storyline. OFUM&#39;s is the Lina/Gimli relationship, HFA&#39;s was the Canonquake and the subsequent Sue invasion, etc. Come up with something relating to your fandom/fanbase. My overarching storyline has to do with the fact that fanfiction started in Star Trek.<br>-This cannot be stressed enough: <i>keep it funny</i>. <br>-Don&#39;t get hung up on details. I&#39;ve never attended a university either; so I just modeled some of the scheduling on high school. Focusing on details makes it not funny.<br>-The crazier, the better. OOCness is acceptable to a certain extent. Look at Sauron in OFUM.<br><br>All I can think of right now, but if you need any help with OFU stuff (I don&#39;t know the fandom), I&#39;ll do whatever I can to help.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s hard to write an interesting school setting story without a plot, which is why so many High School AUs are so bad.<br><br>I haven&#39;t gone to college either, but I found it easier to write a master schedule with all the weekly classes, and each class only met once a week or so (it was probably made up for by tons of homework). <br><br>And since I can hardly keep my attention to one plot for seventy five chapters I settled instead for at least one arc per semester, although multiple minor arcs popped up, and there were two main arcs in the third semester of IAHF.

            <p>Back in October when I first applied for Permission, I had linked a story called &quot;Hiding In The Shadows&quot; as the fic I wanted to spork on my first mission. In an unusual bout of forethought, I saved the entire thing, unedited, to a word doc along with another Harry Potter fic that looked like something for ESAS, as it used the same &#39;Sue but made her the personification of magic. It just so happens that the author deleted all of her old fics, gave herself a new name, and then posted a <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730838/1/Beginning-After-The-End">new story</a> that looked like a mix of the first two.<br><br>My question is, do I use the original if the author has already deleted it, or should I use the new version that has been posted? Or, and this is a big or, would I be allowed to  jump in on the Goddess-slaying group mission as a writer instead of a beta? </p>

            <p>Or something similar. I think if the original has been deleted and is nowhere else to be found on the wide wide Web, the general feeling is that it no longer exists and should not be brought back even in a sporking. I would say spork the new version, just to be safe.</p>

Old tasks are carried out by new groups, with little resemblence to their old forms. Look deeper into the swirling mists of time, and see the myriad homes the Protectors have built themselves...<br><br>The four schools of Paladins continue their ancient (well, at least middle-aged) mission: the defence of the Word Worlds against all forms of badfic. To each School is given certain time-hallowed rights - and duties.<br><br>The grey-clad Demas Paladins are Assassins, endowed with the authority to take the life of uncanon. Their fortified bastion in the Warhammer 40K &#39;verse is an ideal training ground for the rigours of combat - but is, of course, equipped with massive portal generators in case it should be discovered.<br><br>The Basel School, led by the former Canon Librarian Xander, hold the keys of exorcism - and the responsibility to use them in defence of the canon even at the risk of their lives. They make their home on a planet called The Library, in the Doctor Who &#39;verse, relocating in time and space whenever they become noticed amid the endless shelves - or when the attack that closed The Library forever draws near.<br><br>The Pyron Paladins, robed in the red and gold (or as everyone else calls it, &#39;orange), are tasked with the destruction of uncanonical locations and items - but carefully, of course. Their spacegoing fleet is made up of the spoils of the war on uncanon - in particular, those parts of the spoils which are able to fly through the void and blow things up.<br><br>To the Indim School is granted the power to relocate people from one dimension to another - whether they be canon or uncanon. The portals on which the PPC relies are held in trust by the Indims, and they make their home in the mountains of New Caledonia, long a PPC stronghold, able to protect this powerful technology.<br><br>Rumours abound of a fifth school, the Flow Paladins, who held all four of the rights - assassination, exorcism, demolition and transportation - but were closed down within five years of their formation. Nevertheless, some claim to have seen them in the quiet places of the multiverse...<br><br>By far the largest of the remnants of the PPC are the Rangers, almost invisible in their camoflagued uniforms. They scout the badfics of all creation, the first to enter, and call upon the Paladins most suited to the task. Their home is the multiverse itself, but their base lies under the Misty Mountains of Middle-earth.<br><br>Supporting them are the Technomancers - or the dosats, as they are commonly known. It is said that their leaders - an AI known only as Ghost, and a computer simulation of the legendary Makes-Things - can supply any technology in the multiverse... for the right price, and if they can be located. Their flying city coasts the spaceways of the multiverse, cloaked and invisible, and at its heart lies a well-kept secret: Node, a man encased in an impenetrable shell, whose mind is wired directly into the ship&#39;s body. Whispers say that he was once a Technomancer named Dann...<br><br>To ensure the PPC&#39;s expansion, the Harpers spread out from their home on Pern to scour the multiverse for recruits - at least in theory. In practice, most recruits are accidental, or extracted from badfics by Paladins. The Harpers concentrate primarily on giving them basic training, before they move on to be fully educated in their chosen vocation.<br><br>And at the heart of the spreading flower of the PPC is the House of Rhodes - the shattered, labyrinthine heart of the old PPC HQ. Here all the children of the PPC meet in the vast Cafeteria. Here the Council - the heads of all the components - assembles to discuss the war they all wage against uncanon. Here the small administration corps known as the Link keep their records, barely more than a census of the PPC&#39;s followers. And here, somewhere, there is a twisted corridor... a closed door... a keyhole.<br><br>A key.<br><br>The key turns. The door opens. And a link between past and future is once more established...<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;It just doesn&#39;t feel like the most efficient way to do things,&quot; Paladin Lucy of the Demas School explained. &quot;You call me in, I call Sara for help, we all report back to the Link...&quot;<br><br>Durran Illian shrugged, throwing his mottled cloak back over his shoulder. &quot;It seems to work,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;And, Lu, you don&#39;t want to throw the word &#39;efficient&#39; around too much. Remember those stories of Mum&#39;s about the time before the Sundering.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But that&#39;s what I mean,&quot; Lucy exclaimed. &quot;Not the Department of Efficiency, obviously,&quot; she made the sign of Legal with one hand, &quot;but the whole &#39;department&#39; system. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier if you didn&#39;t have to pay the dosats for your analysis devices?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, less of that,&quot; Sara Illian spoke up. &quot;You&#39;d do me out of a job if you stopped paying me.&quot;<br><br>Lucy rolled her eyes, and Durran leant across to whisper in her ear. &quot;Never talk about someone with augmentations behind her back,&quot; he said. &quot;They have superhuman hearing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or maybe you&#39;re just not very good at being quiet,&quot; Sara pointed out. &quot;But, speaking of... I&#39;m getting some <i>weird</i> readings off this corridor.&quot;<br><br>Lucy looked up and down the corridor. &quot;It&#39;s grey,&quot; she said after a few moments. &quot;Like, you know, all the others. Okay, it&#39;s a bit less battered than most, but...&quot;<br><br>&quot;And it&#39;s filled with active portals,&quot; Sara said. &quot;We just stepped through one - we actually passed from one universe to another for no reason. Why would the Indims do that? It&#39;s weird.&quot;<br><br>Durran looked around carefully, letting his training as a Ranger substitute for Sara&#39;s augmentation. &quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; he mused. &quot;This isn&#39;t one of the main corridors, but it&#39;s in near-perfect repair. I mean, the doors still have <i>numbers</i> on them. Those were all taken off years ago.&quot;<br><br>Lucy bit her lip and looked between the other two. &quot;Um,&quot; she said. &quot;This doesn&#39;t sound good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Sara agreed. &quot;It sounds like... remember Grandad&#39;s timeslip device?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I used it once,&quot; Lucy nodded. &quot;And I know Aunt Jasmine visited the Old HQ...&quot;<br><br>&quot;But we <i>haven&#39;t</i> timeslipped,&quot; Durran protested. &quot;I mean... we&#39;d know, wouldn&#39;t we?&quot;<br><br>And far behind them, through the tangled corridors of 2012&#39;s HQ, the door swung open once again...<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Or... RP time, anyone? The basic premise is that there is now (briefly) a door between the HQ of now and the House of Rhodes of the year 2069. Three of my agents have wandered through it. Who will they run into? And who else will come through?<br><br>This isn&#39;t an Emergency. It&#39;s an opportunity to roleplay agents talking to each other - to discuss aspects of the PPC we take for granted - and, if you choose, to create new characters from that future time and introduce them. Mine are all descendents of my current agents - yours don&#39;t have to be (but can be!). You can make them just for this, or use them to write future-based missions.<br><br>The primary sources for the future setting are mostly... this post. There&#39;s also <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/TimeTitle.htm">Time Will Decide For Us</a>, which covers the Sundering (briefly), the House of Rhodes and the initiation of a Demas Paladin (they&#39;ve got a thing about ritual); <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndSeventy.htm">End of the Beginning: Seventy Plus</a>, which presents a (short-form) mission, and <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndGhostStory.htm">EOTB: Ghost&#39;s Story</a>, which is set during a brief evacuation of the Technomancers&#39; city.<br><br>And since the prose version can be a little wearing, here&#39;s a summary (with notes on what each organisation is descended from):<br><br><hr>
<br><br>ORGANISATIONS<br><br>The PPC -- A largely scattered body with far more independence between its components. Overall leadership is assumed by the Council, made up of the leaders of all the sections of the PPC. The Flowers have given up leadership as a group - if any of the breed remain in the PPC, they are scattered across all ranks.<br><br>The Paladins -- The Action Departments of the old PPC. There are four schools:<br>-Demas (DMS) -- Those Paladins with the right to assassination. They have the most ritualised entrance proceedures. They wear grey uniforms.<br>-Basel (Bad Slash) -- Those Paladins with the right to exorcism. They are led by Xander, former Canon Librarian.<br>-Pyron (DOGA) -- Those Paladins with the right to demolition. They wear orange and red uniforms.<br>-Indim (Despatch &amp; Implausible Crossovers) -- Those Paladins with the right to interdimensional transportation.<br>The former fifth school, Flow (Floaters), held all four rights, but were shut down within five years of forming.<br><br>-Note that these are the only Council-authorised Action-Department-analogues in place. The Infrastructure-Department-analogues aren&#39;t so restricted - if you see a niche, decide who it&#39;s descended from and fill it.<br><br>The Rangers (Intel) -- The largest remnant of the PPC. They are the first to enter any badfic, and call in the appropriate Paladins to do the active work. They tend to wear camoflauge.<br><br>The Technomancers (DoSAT) -- aka the dosats. They still provide technology to the PPC (for a price). They are led by an AI calling itself Ghost, and a beta-level simulation of Makes-Things (from the Revelation Space &#39;verse).<br><br>The Harpers (the training side of Personnel) -- Provide Agents with groundings in a large numbers of fandoms. Task-specific training is handled by the departments.<br><br>The Link (the admin side of Personnel, and various other Inf departments) -- A very small central administration corps who are little more than census operators.<br><br>PLACES<br><br>House of Rhodes -- The centre of the old HQ, named after the Rhodedendron. Contains a small administrative corps (the Link) and the PPC cafeteria.<br><br>Demas -- Warhammer 40K. Base hooked up to massive portal generators in case of attack.<br>Basel -- The Library, Doctor Who. Due to the Vashta Nerada attack, their entire base is occasionally portalled back in time and to a new area of the Library.<br>Pyron --  Fleet of mass destruction.<br>Indim -- New Caledonia to protect most powerful technology.<br><br>Rangers -- Misty Mountains, Middle-earth.<br>Technomancers -- Flying city (Cities In Flight) with surrounding. Their city is actually a McCaffrey-verse shellperson (with Warhammer 40K, Star Trek and Doctor Who enhancements) known as Node (ie, Dann).<br>Harpers -- Pern&#39;s Southern continent. 50-year time jumps to avoid Thread. Some have Fire Lizards.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>RP guidelines: Not many, really. Be polite, don&#39;t God-Mod, and let&#39;s try to keep it all in a single chain, rather than splintering off in all directions.<br><br>Oh, and Have Fun!<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Obviously, the prose above - and particularly the section with actual dialogue - is intended to be what the first replier responds to... unless they want to send someone else through the door, instead)</p>

            <p>...but stopped as soon as he saw Homles. He stifled a yelp of terror and retreated back to his Response Centre&#39;s door, half closing it behind him. Peering though the crack, he asked: &quot;Is it safe? It&#39;s not radioactive or mutant or anything, is it?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>((As for the Nexuses, I&#39;ve got an explanation for their advantages over HQ: they use stabilized natural plotholes instead of portal generators. This technology reduces energy consumption by at least fifty percent according to DoSAT, since agents only have to use their RAs once to get out of a fic. Another thing is that it encourages Spies to stay longer in-World, so they can reduce the volume of badfic that goes into Sorting by filtering it at the source. It could also tie into the separation of departments during the Sundering: since future!HQ seems rather deserted, the DoI could have retreated to its outlying outposts during the Fourth Civil War...<br><br>Methinks I&#39;ve put waaaaaay too much thought into this.))</p>

            <p>Lucy looked on with growing concern as Kali, Kelok and Unger made their plans. &quot;I&#39;m not really sure that&#39;s a good idea,&quot; she put in. &quot;I mean, temporal instabilities aside, the House of Rhodes is a dangerous place.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Boring, she means,&quot; Durran retorted. &quot;If you come visit, you have to go somewhere <i>cool</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You live under a mountain, Durran,&quot; Sara pointed out. &quot;That&#39;s not &#39;cool&#39; in any way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Guys,&quot; Lucy said in a strained voice, &quot;that was... how does the quote go? &#39;A clever lie&#39;. They... okay.&quot; She turned and glanced at the assembled past PPCers. &quot;Meaning no offence to anyone, but not everyone in the history of the PPC is particularly <i>nice</i>. The last thing we want is some Department of Author Correction nutjob coming to pay us a friendly visit. And that could be <i>any</i> of you.&quot;<br><br><i>(I&#39;ve always thought it would be awesome if the Fourth Civil War was a <b>proper</b> civil war, with &#39;good people&#39; - and &#39;bad people&#39; - on both sides.

And as Aaron <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndHence.htm">pointed out</a>, it&#39;s just as easy to see the Department of Efficiency and Author Correction as the goodies - and the various conservative rebels (former PPC agents and their families, the oldest surviving Flower, etc etc) as the maniacs bent on... well, on the sort of Sundering that eventually happened)</i></p>

            <p>That would be awesometastic. ;D<br><br>I&#39;ll point you again in the direction of <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndSeventy.htm">Seventy Plus</a>, which established the basic parameters for missions - or at least how missions are <i>meant</i> to go. Essentially:<br><br>-Ranger goes in and scouts to determine the type of story<br>-Ranger calls in the appropriate Paladins<br>-Ranger fills the Paladins in<br>-Paladins finish the mission according to the formula (as described therein - it&#39;s the witness/evidence part)<br><br>Of course, that&#39;s predicated on the Ranger and Paladin(s) working well together - and Lucy and Durran are cousins. So there&#39;s room for endless variation. The primary real differences are that the Ranger sticks around rather than just sending a report (again, in theory), that you can regularly have more than one School&#39;s Paladins in a mission (for instance, a Mary-Sue who causes a Geographical Aberration would need a Demas and Pyron Paladin), and that formula at the end (which is regarded about the same as our charge lists).<br><br>And if you write a spinoff set there, and define the parameters of What Makes A Mission a bit further, I may well write another in <i>your</i> version...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a little hard to say for sure what the canon of the future will be, unless you can talk the Boarders of ten to twenty years from now into writing things that way.

            <p>... that it might become a <i>fait accompli</i> - that if enough people in 2012 write about it as the expected future, then the people of 2032 will call it canon and stick with it.

            <p>&quot;That sounds like a lot more fun version of World One. I&#39;m Unger, and this is Homles,&quot; he said pointing to the the glowing mini. &quot;Kelok and I are in the All-Purpose Department, Sherlock Holmes Division. We get mostly movie related badfic, a lot of Bad Slash missions, some Sues--Kelok really doesn&#39;t like those--and sometimes we have to rescue Holmes and Watson from really weird situations, like when we had to pull most of the cast out of a Victorian zombie apocalypse world and put them back where they belong.&quot; He leaned in conspiratorially. &quot;The Ironic Overpower is completely real and in charge.&quot;</p>

            <p>It was then that Eagrus noticed it had been swapped back, his trusty sword now when it should be.

            <p>Jenni, not entirely reassured by Unger&#39;s description, cast a last dubious look at Homles before making a decision. &quot;Henry, I think he&#39;s a little too big for you to play with right now. Sorry, kiddo.&quot; She boosted him up higher from the ground.<br><br>Henry&#39;s expression crumpled as though he were going to cry, but a better idea occurred. If he couldn&#39;t get down, maybe the shiny green critter could come up? Leaning out as far as he could, he reached for Homles, opening and closing one hand in a sort of summons. &quot;Puppy! Here, puppy!&quot;<br><br>Jenni rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh, shells. We&#39;d probably better get going soon.&quot; She turned back to the group from the future. &quot;For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve never heard of a Department of Author Correction. There was Author <i>Correspondence</i>, but that closed down when its last agent left a few years ago. The last evil whackjobs we had around here were the Mysterious Somebody and the Black Cats. So, either it hasn&#39;t happened yet, or it doesn&#39;t happen for us at all in this timeline.&quot; She gave a one-shoulder shrug. &quot;That said, I&#39;ve made a habit of not crossing myself in time, and I&#39;d like to keep it that way. One existence at a time, that&#39;s me.&quot;<br><br>(( As for Nexuses, all portals are essentially stable plotholes if I remember right, but using less of them to conserve power makes some sense. And heck, HQ is built of tunnels randomly interspersed throughout the multiverse anyway. You might be able to punch a hole in the right corridor and have a more direct way in and out, depending on how far underground/high up in a mountain/wherever it is. ))</p>

            <p>Gaspard sort of half-appeared beside the pair in the characteristic manner of the Spies: completely unnoticed until they spoke up.<br><br>&quot;Sorry, but if you don&#39;t mind me adding my two cents on this... What if our attempts to watch for the rise of the new departments actually gives birth to the DoE and the DAC? We could all be participants of a stable time loop and not know it. Sure, there&#39;s always the possibility of the universe following Professor Matsumoto&#39;s branch theory, but these people from the future couldn&#39;t be speaking to us if their past wasn&#39;t already validated by our actions.

Heh. Just wait until I report this to the the professor...

            <p>&quot;Why do I even bother with this half the time?&quot; Indim Paladin Emara muttered to herself as she made her way down the dim grey corridor. &quot;This portal here isn&#39;t working, that one dropped me off two years early, the one over there was off by an eighth of a centimeter. It&#39;s not a perfect science.&quot;<br><br>She could see the wavering blue light of the portal as she turned around a corner of the dusty maze. How was this one <i>unusual</i> like the report had claimed? It was the right color, the right size, not collapsing in on itself like many of the old ones were wont to do. And where was the person who filed the report? It was common courtesy to wait for the repair-person to arrive so that you could list your complaints. Granted, the Indim School wasn&#39;t very well liked among the four schools, but that didn&#39;t excuse people from things like manners.<br><br>She huffed to herself as she neared the portal. There wasn&#39;t anything wrong. The generator seemed to be in good working order, as far as staring at it could tell. It almost seemed too good; according to her map of portal sites, this was one of the oldest ones, leading to an area right outside Rivendell. She had been expecting pieces held together with tape and parts replaced with shoelaces, not a little machine chugging along without a care in the world. <br><br>She shrugged her suspicion aside and ran a hand through her close-cropped blond hair. It didn&#39;t seem like there were any problems that she would have to break out her toolkit for, but often times that could only be judged by going through. She reached her arm out to touch the shimmering blue surface of the portal- only to be intercepted by the figure that had just stepped through.<br><br>((Jumping in on this a bit late, but there&#39;s still room on this side of the mysterious circumstance. What would happen if a modern agent stepped forward?))</p>

            <p>Eagrus pricked up his ears, not that it was easy to tell under his helmet.<br><br>&quot;Mana?

I must say, I hold it in much higher regard - &quot; he glanced at Cyba, Sigma and Phi &quot; - than tech.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You would,&quot; Cyba retorted. &quot;You are: one, from a fantasy continuum, and two, have so far not managed to have a Disguise Generator blow up in your face and turn you into... this.&quot; She indicated her rather frightening appearance, and that of Sigma and Phi (who were extra copies of her spawned by a Stu&#39;s misspelling, while on a mission after the Disguise Generator incident).<br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t say you didn&#39;t have that coming,&quot; replied Eagrus. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have annoyed the IO. If you hadn&#39;t, you wouldn&#39;t have the body of an undead tech monster.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I know: or occasional tendencies creeping into the back of my mind, not to mention what happens around <i>actual</i> Borg,&quot; muttered Cyba. She, Sigma and Phi all shuddered involuntarily. After all, faulty connectivity still gave little defence against the influence that came from such proximity.<br><br>&quot;Anyway,&quot; interjected Phi, &quot;let&#39;s not get into the whole magic versus tech thing now, please?&quot;<br><br>So they let Eagrus talk to Riaa, and three women continued to converse with Sara.<br><br>A/N: this should offer a brief explanation of some of the happenings from my agents&#39; missions, for those who are unfamiliar with them and their history (and the hows and whys of what Cyba, Sigma and Phi are).

            <p>&quot;Yes, for magic,&quot; Riaa explained. With a flick of her hand, her shadow began to move, growing upwards and forming shapes. &quot;That&#39;s a mana art, since my affinity is with shadow-magic. Drow can live for centuries in a constant supply of mana - for example, in a large city of drow. The older you get, the more drow you need to be around. Diva&#39;ratrika, the oldest of us, needed to stay in one of our biggest cities to not die. But I&#39;m young, and spend enough time in magical continua to not wither.&quot;<br><br>Laede leaned over. &quot;I use magic too - this gem is my power&#39;s source.

            <p>&quot;Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t,&quot; admitted Eagrus, &quot;although I have visited the Underdark at least once on a mission. Interesting place - from a safe hiding place, at least. I do wonder, though, is magic always something you&#39;re either born with or without, or can it be taught? Even, say, the teensiest, tiniest little bit just to annoy Little Miss Tech over there?&quot; He glanced in Cyba&#39;s direction, but she was too occupied by her own conversation to notice.</p>

            <p>Riaa frowned. &quot;My magic is that of the drow and the dark elves. Goblins - humans, I mean, don&#39;t have auras in my universe.

            <p>&quot;I have inborn magic,&quot; Lee said, joining in on the conversation.

The Rhododendron was... the leader of the Link, I think? No, that&#39;s not right... um. Anyway, he&#39;s... basically we&#39;re from the future and Lu&#39;s going to tell me off a <i>lot</i> if I say too much.&quot;<br><br>Lucy, however, wasn&#39;t listening. She&#39;d been eavesdropping on the ongoing (and expanding) magic discussion, and finally had to put a word in. &quot;There&#39;s this Demas Paladin I&#39;m training - Deborah, her name is - and she&#39;s got magic, too. She said she &#39;just picked it up somewhere&#39;, but the way she talks to her brother... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s almost like they have a very sneaky magic war going on.&quot;<br><br>The sound of singing distracted her, and she turned to see the newly-arrived woman in the white coat. &quot;That&#39;s Uncle Tanfin&#39;s favourite song,&quot; she commented, then grinned wryly. &quot;Well, &#39;favourite&#39; as in &#39;favourite to make fun of&#39;. I didn&#39;t know it was so old.&quot;<br><br>Nearby, Sara laughed. &quot;There <i>are</i> a few things that predate your birth, Lu,&quot; she pointed out, and nodded at Cyba and company. &quot;Like that Disguise Generator...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;It pains me to deal without bargaining at least a little... but just this once.&quot;<br><br>The dosat reached a hand up to her cheek and pulled away a fingertip-sized node of the web. The fibrous wires immediately curled in upon themselves, and it seemed as if an invisible light that used to surround it had gone out. &quot;It can last for a week or so unattached,&quot; she said. &quot;If you press it to a mammal-like sentient&#39;s cheek, it&#39;ll attach and start the augmentation process. Er, what else?&quot; She scratched her arm absently. &quot;Oh, it&#39;ll build a construct based on the wearer&#39;s personality to teach you the interface. And it&#39;ll need to grow to full size - about three, four months - before it can spawn again.&quot; She held out the little ball of wire in one hand. &quot;Now gimme.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Done,&quot; agreed Sigma, taking the ball of wire and handing over the data storage containing the schematics. &quot;You have our thanks.&quot; She turned to Phi and Cyba. &quot;Okay, now whose turn is it for dibs? Last mission, Cyba got the coat, Phi got the minis, and I got the ship, so I guess we&#39;re even at the moment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She said it can spawn another after three, four months,&quot; Cyba reminded them. &quot;So we all get one eventually.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I might want to wait until I&#39;ve got my minis better trained,&quot; said Phi. &quot;Besides, Cyba probably needs it the most, because she&#39;s mission-active.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see how this and our current implants combine with each other,&quot; grinned Sigma enthusiastically.<br><br>&quot;If this Exonet can teach us how to interface with it, it might be able to teach us how to better use our own current implants, too,&quot; mused Cyba. &quot;Thing is, I have Mess and Joke more readily available for that, should they ever become more amenable to tutoring rather than playing pranks. I vote Sigma gets it first.&quot;<br><br>Sigma grinned. &quot;I&#39;ll keep you posted,&quot; she promised, and pressed it to her cheek, where it took hold immediately. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s see what happens.&quot;<br><br>With that, the trio vanished through a portal to Sigma&#39;s RC, having completely forgotten about Eagrus and his magic discussion.<br><br>***<br><br>&quot;Technomancy?&quot; spluttered Eagrus, so absorbed in the magic conversation that all he noticed of the tech trade going on beside him was Cyba, Sigma and Phi&#39;s disappearance into Sigma&#39;s RC.<br><br>&quot;Who in the multiverse would want to combine magic and technology?&quot; he continued. &quot;I mean, magic is far superior, surely?&quot;<br></p>

Magic has a supporting role <i>at best</i> in any real-world applications.&quot;<br><br>She held up a hand and counted off her points on her fingers. &quot;First off, it&#39;s too volatile. You never know when it&#39;ll just go off in your face. Second, it&#39;s just plain fickle - the cliche of magical items betraying their owners must go back at least fifty years.&quot; She paused and blinked. &quot;Which, if what I heard from Paladin Trading Cards over there, isn&#39;t actually yet, but still.<br><br>&quot;Third, not everyone can even <i>use</i> magic - and there&#39;s a fair number of religions which make their adherents almost pathalogically against the stuff. And fourth, most forms of magic simply aren&#39;t properly controllable. You can&#39;t go around drawing heptagrams every time you need to analyse a character or whatever.&quot;<br><br>She sniffed. &quot;Oh, I admit some of it can be useful - like those Muggle-use wands we make for Paladins in the Albus Potter fandom - but that&#39;s <i>extremely</i> tightly controlled, and really is more tech than magic.<br><br>&quot;<i>And</i>, speaking of technology,&quot; she added, drawing a deep breath, &quot;I really should get this back to the City. Lu, you know the way back, right?&quot;<br><br><i>(Sara has opinions. Lots of them)</i></p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, what?&quot; asked Cepha. &quot;I&#39;d like to see how well your tech works in an EMP blast. And besides, how many magic systems do you even know?&quot;<br><br>Amara nodded. &quot;Magic, wielded by a <i> competent </i> mage, is no more volatile than a good tech weapon. Two, just how often does your tech break down when you tempt the Ironic Overpower too much. And it&#39;s much more versatile, besides - my magic can  summon my weapons, open doorways to my pocket dimension, create magical armor for myself, heal most injuries, <i> and </i> create minions, all in a gemstone that fits in my hand. Can any one piece of your tech do all that?&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Des lifted a finger. &quot;As usual, truth is somewhere in the middle,&quot; he said. &quot;Magic and tech both have their uses, faults, and pros. Of course, the use is limited by the continuum you&#39;re in at the moment. Disregarding that, I believe that an Agent should keep both magical and technological armaments around. Look at my weapons - on one hand, a magical Border Axe from <i>Torchlight II</i>; on the other hand, a Hunting Machine sniper rifle from <i>E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</i>. Or, look at Anebrin. Present Anebrin, I mean, not your future version. He&#39;s got both a blessed (if sentient) sword, a mundane bow, and a B.O.S.C.O sniper rifle.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Excuse me for a second,&quot; said Gaspard as he pulled a little crank-operated music box.

            <p>&quot;Well, I&#39;m firmly on the side of magic,&quot; stated Eagrus. &quot;Tech&#39;s more trouble than it&#39;s worth.

That way, even with Cyba banging on about her new tech for the next week, he would have something to fire back. Besides, the trio might just forget about his calling them the Collective of Three.<br><br>&quot;So you&#39;re from the future, and this <i>Albus Potter</i> has eclipsed <i>Harry Potter</i>?&quot; he asked. &quot;This <i>Albus Potter</i> must be quite something...&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Suddenly a spine tingling howl sounded from somewhere near followed almost immediately by crashing and someone screaming.  A large, baggy skinned, green, glowing puppy appeared in the intersection dragging a small half-elf who was clinging to the leash. The mini-Hound of the Baskervilles skidded, his claws not gaining traction on the generic surface, and the half-elf, dog, and leash ended up tumbling into the wall. Glowing green drool was sent flying against the wall.<br><br>&quot;Unger? What got him so excited now?&quot; The speaker stepped into the intersection. He was a tall man with white hair, green tinged white skin, and a long black leather coat that had a flashpatch with a rubber Swiss Army knife on it.<br><br>&quot;Ow,&quot; the half-elf said dramatically as he untangled himself from the leash. &quot;No, no, don&#39;t worry, Kelok, I&#39;m fine. No idea what got him this time.&quot; He glared at the puppy. &quot;I thought we were past this whole drag the half-elf through the halls stage, Homles.&quot;<br><br>Homles looked chagrined, and gently tugged at the leash in the direction of the mass of present and future agents.<br><br>Kelok and Unger took their turn to look chagrined at not having noticed the large gathering.<br><br>Unger bounded up to Jenni and Henry. &quot;Oh wow, is there a party, Jenni?&quot; <br><br>Kelok hung back, looking nervous, as he rubbed his hands together and hesitated--a very odd image for a Stargate verse Wraith.<br><br><br>(OOC note: Both of these guys have the natural lifespan to still be around in this future setting, though Unger could have decided to go home. Also, for those that don&#39;t remember Unger, he is a 5&#39;3&quot; D&amp;D 3.5 half-elf barbarian who wears a kilt, decorative collar, boots, and his flashpatch on an armband. He carries an axe. I figure Kelok and Unger met Jenni during their stay in FicPsych)<br><br></p>

            <p>Kaliel turned at the sight of Unger, a smile lighting up her face. If Unger was here, then-- Ah, yes, there was Kelok. She detached herself from the group conversing about magic and technology, leaving Lee behind to continue that debate, and then made her way over to the Wraith.<br><br>&quot;Kelok, it&#39;s been a while,&quot; she said, coming to a halt near him. &quot;You&#39;ve come at an interesting time.&quot;</p>

            <p>From a side-passage (had that been there before?), a sound of singing came drifting along. It was a rarely heard sound, since the voice responsible had a history of soothing ragged souls and inspiring the downtrodden and such, and its owner didn&#39;t like to talk about it, but in this case she was making an exception for the amusement of her three-year-old son. So Jenni Robinson sang out:<br><br>&quot;In the middle of the earth in the land of the Shire lives a brave little hobbit whom we all admire. With his long wooden pipe, fuzzy, woolly toes&quot;—the boy giggled, much as though his feet had just been tickled—&quot;he lives in a hobbit-hole and everybody knows him—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!&quot; Henry caroled on cue, if not exactly on pitch or rhythm.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s only three feet tall,&quot; Jenni sang back as they entered the main hallway.<br><br>&quot;Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!&quot;<br><br>&quot;The bravest little—whoa, traffic jam.&quot; Jenni stopped short at the sight of the small crowd ahead. &quot;Hey, folks! What&#39;s the commotion? Is everything all right?&quot;<br><br>A quick scan of the faces she could see revealed no one she knew well, though one or two were vaguely familiar. Maybe they&#39;d been in FicPsych recently. For herself, she was still wearing her white coat with the black on white exclamation-points flash patch; she hadn&#39;t bothered to change before going to pick up her kid from the Nursery.</p>

            <p>Agent Desdendelle was lost. He was trying really hard not to reach RC log <i>e</i> after going to the Cafeteria for a snack, so far without much success. He passed an Agent who looked like she just bumped into something, and a trio of people who looked vaguely out of place. At first, he didn&#39;t pay much attention to them, continuing past them, but when he heard snippets from their conversation, he stopped in his tracks. The numbers were taken off the RCs&#39; doors ages ago? Well, if that wasn&#39;t interesting, he didn&#39;t know what <i>was</i>. He turned around and returned to where the Agent and the trio stood.<br>“Excuse me,” he said, absentmindedly running a finger on his axe&#39;s blade – a bad habit he was trying to get rid of.</p>

            <p>By the time Desdendelle appeared, Sara was lost in a world of her own - or, more accurately, of Agent Natasha&#39;s.

I can actually see the resistors...&quot;<br><br>Durran, meanwhile, was helping Natasha out by gathering up the trading cards - except that &#39;help&#39; was something of a misnomer, since he spent more time looking at each one (&quot;Is this a <i>first edition</i>?!&quot;) than actually being productive.<br><br>And that left Lucy, whose head snapped round when Desdendelle spoke.

I-&quot; She stopped, frowned, and rubbed her eyes. &quot;Sorry. Okay. You probably don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;ll start over. Hi?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lucy! Durran! Sara!

            <p>Agents Cepha and Amara walked through the halls. The two of them had just spent an annoyingly long, if instructive, mission with Agent Riaa&#39;lzhor of the DMS. Fiorano, as she usually did after missions, had headed off to the Medical department, where she would spend about half an hour or more talking with her elder sister, Ari. <br><br>Cepha frowned as they walked through the halls. There looked like there was a small kerfuffle in front of one of the RCs, with grey-costumed people apparently playing with trading cards and some kind of game device. Cepha frowned, about to ask what in Madoka&#39;s name was going on, when a gasp came from behind the two.<br><br>Standing behind them were two more grey-clothed agents. One looked like a teenaged girl, with long, blond hair and yellow eyes. Attached to her neck was a glowing, golden gem shaped like a flame. Unlike the others, her clothes seemed to be more fanciful, mostly a dark yellow with grey sleeves.  Her partner couldn&#39;t be more different - a tall, deep blue drider, her face and body marked with scars, wearing a well-worn blue cloak over her shoulders.<br><br>The yellow-haired girl looked stunned. &quot;M-mom?&quot; she asked.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Riaa&#39;lzhor Val&#39;Demas and her partner, Paladin Kaede Hinata, carefully walked through the halls. Kaede was surprised at the hallways - she hadn&#39;t seen anything like this for... fifty years, maybe? Riaa&#39;lzhor seemed distant, like always, but even Kaede could tell that she was distressed. The drider, one of the few who still remained from before the Sundering, seemed to get twitchy around anything that reminded her of that time. <br><br>Kaede frowned, anxiously touching her Soul Gem around her neck. She sighed in relief as she spotted the grey costumes of her fellow Paladins - then stopped in surprise as she saw a pair of girls standing with their backs to the pair, one with green hair and one with grey, no older than she appeared to be. She involuntarily gasped as she realized why they seemed familiar.<br><br>The two turned around, and Kaede was sure that she&#39;d gone insane. Because standing in front of her, impossibly young, stood her mother.<br><br>~~~~~~~~<br><i> AN: So yeah! I figure that Riaa is a drider, and so would live for centuries, and Kaede, as a Puella Magi, is pretty much immortal - though Kaede was quite young at the time of the Sundering, I&#39;m assuming, and so doesn&#39;t remember much.  </i></p>

            <p>Kaliel smiled, the comforting litany of canon washing over her. &quot;You /are/ from the future, then?&quot; she asked. &quot;Can you prove it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If they&#39;re really from the future, anything they say might affect us,&quot; Lee said. Roshaun uncurled himself from around her neck, stopping his impression of a fur stole as he looked at the others.<br><br>&quot;She has a point. Any knowledge of the future could impact the past.

            <p>&quot;Did somebody say Disguise Generator?&quot; asked a trio of voices, as three female Borg agents came around the corner, with a fully-armoured Easterling man trailing reluctantly behind.

            <p>I have a couple of old Pern RP characters who might do with a bit of reworking... I never did flesh out the one journeyman&#39;s sister, either. Opportunity!<br><br>As for Andalites, the most reliable thing I could turn up in a Google search was a remark by Ax that if he lived to be 200, he would never escape Elfangor&#39;s shadow. Trouble is, how much of a reach from the average lifespan is that number, and what kind of years is he talking about? Andalite years are the length of about seven Earth years, so their centuries would be about 700 Earth years long. If he&#39;s talking about 200 Andalite years, that&#39;s a long, long time. I tend to assume he&#39;s talking about Earth years.<br><br>So, I dunno, maybe something like 150-170 is safe?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(dammit hS, you beat me to the punch for an RP starter. Oh well, this one is more... lighthearted?)<br><br>It started with a flying pillow. No one knew who threw it, only that it seemed to have come out of nowhere and hit Agent Christianne Shieh right in the back of the head as she was exiting Rudi&#39;s Pub.<br><br>Exactly who would bring a pillow to a pub was entirely beyond anyone, really, but what made even less sense was how Christianne oh-so-conveniently had a pillow on hand, and whirled around to chuck the feather-bomb back into the pub.<br><br>Feather-bomb was accurate, for her pillow exploded right over Spy Rooney from the Department of Intelligence. The ex-Metropolitan Police officer wiped the down from his brows, grabbed another pillow - was the pub suddenly fuelled by pillow-filled plotholes, or something? - and shouted:<br>&quot;Oh, you had it coming!&quot;<br><br>And thus began the 2012 All-HQ Extra-Vicious Pillow Fight.<br></p>

The blur, now identifiable as a green-maned yellow pegasus, steered its way back to the protoss and started talking quickly as it hovered in front of his face: &quot;Taldaris! Taldaris! You gotta come quick! There&#39;s a mini-Discord loose in the Canon Library and... and...&quot; The pony stopped talking as she looked at the agents behind the DIA agent.<br><br>&quot;<i>Clam down, Cloudsweeper.

            <p>(( I believe it&#39;s time for my agents to actually do something. It&#39;s either that or study for finals. I don&#39;t want to study for finals ))<br><br>Agent Peregrin was walking through the corridors of HQ, chanting quietly to avoid focusing on where he was headed. Though he was attempting to forget the fact, Peregrin was going to DoSAT to get his new partner a CAD. Sometime during his journey, Peregrin wandered by Rudi&#39;s Pub. Unfortunately for Peregrin, he passed by the pub during the Great Pillow Fight of Whenever-It-Was. <br><br>A large, fluffy, feathered pillow flew out the now-open door of Rudi&#39;s, and sailed straight at Peregrin. Peregrin saw the pillow coming out the door and stopped, somewhat surprised that a pillow was flying out of a bar. If Peregrin had kept walking, he would have gone straight into the path of the pillow and been knocked down.<br><br>Peregrin looked around and waited to see if anyone was going to come out of the bar to claim the pillow. When no one come, he picked up the pillow and went up to the door of the pub and knocked on the open door to announce himself. The other patrons barely noticed the old-looking man in what looked like a black monk&#39;s robe with a DMS flashpatch sewn on. Peregrin, when he realized could not be heard over the chaos of drunk, very drunk, and sober agents pillow fighting, began to speak in the manner of a professor teaching a somewhat large class, &quot;Excuse me! <i>Excuse me!</i> This pillow flew out of this room approximately two minutes ago. To whom should I return it?&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Peregrin replied to the Spy, &quot;and I must be going. I am attempting to—&quot;<br><br>Peregrin&#39;s explanation was interrupted by a pillow thrown at him from a distant part of the room, which hit Peregrin in the chest and bounced off and landed on the ground. Peregrin turned around and began to leave the doorway. Before he could get very far, however, he was hit in the back of the head with a large, overstuffed feather pillow. <br><br>Peregrin turned around and saw the smirking agent who had thrown that pillow at him. Peregrin walked toward the agent and told him, &quot;That attack was unacceptable behavior.&quot; The agent responded by throwing a small pillow at Peregrin lightheartedly and running away into the crowd. Peregrin barely dodged the pillow, which hit someone behind him.<br><br>Peregrin then realized that he had no choice but to participate in the fight, thanks in part to the Narrative Laws. So, he quickly removed his sphere from the backpack he was wearing, formed it in to a large, dense, oval shield, held it in front of him, and walked into Rudi&#39;s. <br><br>(( Note: &quot;Sphere&quot; is a word that&#39;s overloaded with a different meaning in Peregrin&#39;s home continuum, <i>Anathem</i> Also, where are the bartenders and other staff up to during all this? )) </p>

            <p>&quot;Makes sense,&quot; she murmured.

Veralyn did still feel as though she owed the girl for helping her survive the demon wounds and taking her and Firebrand willingly into her home.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Veralyn finally promised. &quot;For now, it sounds like our missing mini is trashing a library. Why don&#39;t we put this on the back fire for now, and focus on getting the mini under control?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Back burner - and thankies!&quot; Caroline squealed, jumping up and hugging Veralyn before remembering the many knives the woman was varying on her person and stepping back with an apologetic smile.</p>

            <p>&quot;Out! Out, you little bugger!&quot; shouted the dark-skinned Nurse as he swatted at the mini-Discord that was wreaking havoc in every ward except the one in which the Rookie Agents Scott and Kira were recuperating. That one had been deadbolted, and Nurse Hearth had his eye on the Ironic Overpower. <br><br>The doors to Medical swung open and Christianne and Eledhwen entered - or rather, Christianne entered carrying Eledhwen. <br><br>&quot;Smelling salts, Nurse!&quot; shouted Christianne, depositing Eledhwen on a hospital bed only for the elleth to get bombarded with chocolate syrup. This attack had the twofold reaction of violently reviving Eledhwen, and of causing her to scream blue murder at the mayhem around her. </p>

            <p>Pubs. Interesting places, full of people, noise, and booze. In other words: places that made Agent Desdendelle sigh, cover his ears, and head toward the nearest exit. Usually. But this day (inasmuch it was a day; the axe-wielding Agent found it hard to tell, in HQ) was special. After all, meeting a bit one had rescued from a terrible badfic, when said bit was supposed to join one on one&#39;s next mission, wasn&#39;t something that happened every day, was it now?<br>So Des was sitting in the corner of Rudi&#39;s Pub, sipping Japanese plum liqueur from a small porcelain cup and watching the person who sat across the table.<br>That person was tall, dark-haired, and bulky. He wore simple, utilitarian clothes, and looked like you could lose him in a crowd in no time – in short, he looked Generic. What set him apart from the rest of the pub&#39;s occupants – as well as from the majority of the Agents in HQ – was the long, black, glaive-like Device that stood leaning on the wall within his reach.<br>“So, Captain,” Des said, “I understand you specialise in portal magic.”<br>“Yes, sir,” the bit answered. “I do not have many memories of actually using my skills for combat, but my instructors told me that I have great potential.”<br>“Navare, please,” the boy across the table from the <i>Nanoha</i>-verse mage said exasperatedly, “stop calling me sir. It&#39;s embarrassing.”<br>Then someone threw a pillow in their general direction. Acting on instinct, Des slashed the pillow in half with his axe, then immediately started to sneeze.<br>“Bless you,” said Navare and turned. Right in time to get a pillow straight to the face. The mage rocked back for a moment, picked it up, and launched it back toward the person who threw it, putting a little too much force behind the throw.</p>

            <p>The thrown pillow missed it&#39;s target, rocketed out the door, hit a wall and bounced off it. It hit at an angle, which caused it to travel all the way down the hall. All the way down to the corner. That Agent Sylvia just happened to be turning right that very instant.<br><br>FWUMP!<br><br>&quot;Gahh!&quot; Sylvia whipped out her Deathclaw Gauntlet and slashed, but the fluffy assailant had already fallen to the ground. The agent stared at it for a few seconds. When it had shown no signs of life, she figured it was just a normal pillow that someone had thrown at her.<br><br>Except that there was no one else in the hallway. And considering that her bosses were talking flowers, it really wasn&#39;t that far fetched that a pillow could gain sentience and attack her, was it?<br><br>Sylvia cautiously poked it with her boot. The pillow sat there. She reached down and picked it up with her left hand. The agent looked around for any possible source of the thing, but only saw an open door on the other end of the hallway.<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot;<br><br>Just then, something crashed into her from behind. As she was falling, Sylvia twisted around, the pillow slipping from her grasp and rocketing off to find another target.</p>

This act was rewarded with three different pillows to the face.<br><br>&quot;Will!&quot; He shrugged at her from behind his silvery shield.<br><br>&quot;I never said I would be protecting you.&quot; He tossed another pillow in her direction, which she caught and tried to return.

            <p>Much like Agents Kaylin and Will, the sole purpose of Agents Nothing and Ivy&#39;s trip to Rudi&#39;s pub was to get a drink, a somewhat celebratory affair commemorating the end of a particularly long mission. Unfortunately for them the peaceful drink they desired was not to be.<br>&quot;Oh God, what now.&quot; were the first words that escaped Nothing&#39;s mouth as she laid her eyes on the pillowy chaos before her &quot;Can&#39;t I ever, just once in my life, have a nice moment of peace and quiet? Is that too much to ask?&quot;<br>&quot;Oh cheer up No!&quot; Ivy said cheerfully as she plucked a bear-shaped Pillow Pet up off of the floor &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all just for fun, I mean you really can&#39;t do much harm with pillows, can you?&quot;<br>Agent Ivy was then proven wrong when a pillow traveling at high speeds smacked her in the side of the head.<br>&quot;Who just signed themselves up to die?!&quot; she demanded, fire burning in her gray eyes as she turned a full circle looking for the culprit.</p>

            <p>Will shouted to the agent that had felt the wrath of Kaylin&#39;s cylindrical pillow. He was sure that if Kaylin could see him behind his table and charm, she would be ready to rip his head off for betraying her. She was ready to do that on a normal basis.</p>

            <p>This time though, it was in the back of the head, a brutal blow compared to the others. She was conflicted as to whether she should go after Will, for ratting her out and betraying her, or the girl who was currently doing a victory dance after seeing her shot connect. She decided that the girl would probably do more harm, and sent a nearby scented pillow towards her and her partner. She then rolled under the table to where Will was camping out and glared at him. He just grinned back.</p>

            <p>Ivy&#39;s victory dance was rudely interrupted by a scented pillow connecting to her gut. She fell over dramatically, almost knocking Agent Nothing over in the process. The brown haired agent looked down at her partner on the floor with a face that clearly expressed that she was not amused.<br>&quot;Right then.&quot; she said as she prodded Ivy&#39;s mass of long white hair with her foot. &quot;If you&#39;re going to get yourself all tangled up in this mess, I&#39;m going to go take a nap.&quot; She grabbed a large down feather pillow off of a nearby table and settled herself down on a gigantic cushion in the corner of the room.<br>Ivy got up off of the floor, brushing dust, feathers, and who knows what else off of her long black skirt.<br>&quot;Spoilsport!&quot; she said, sticking her tongue out in Nothing&#39;s direction. She lobbed the scented pillow back in the direction it had come from and then picked up a long, tube-shaped pillow off of the floor in order to engage her combatant in close quarters.</p>

            <p>Will exclaimed, as the scented pillow somehow managed to find an opening in his shield and hit him on top of the head. Kaylin, meanwhile, had picked up a large body pillow and was charging at the white haired agent who wielded a similar weapon.<br><br>&quot;Go Kaylin!&quot; he shouted from his relatively safe spot. The two agents seemed to be using the pillows as swords, whacking each other with them while the other agent&#39;s partner somehow fell asleep amidst the chaos. </p>

            <p>DTE:<br><br>Cyba Zero swayed and promptly fell out of her alcove again - except, to her surprise, she found the usually hard and unrelenting floor was soft and... covered in pillows? She picked herself up and examined one. Definitely a perfectly ordinary pillow. Where had they come from?<br><br>She wandered out of her room to quiz Eagrus on the matter, only for a pillow to hit her full in the face.<br><br>&quot;Haha! Ambush!&quot; cried Eagrus, battering her over the head with said pillow, while Zouh egged him on. Before Cyba could retaliate, two more pillows hit the back of Eagrus&#39; head, accompanied by the sound of Mess Efekt and Joke giggling. Zouh leapt onto Eagrus&#39; shoulder, ready to deflect any more projectiles.<br><br>&quot;Shall we declare an alliance?&quot; suggested Cyba.<br><br>&quot;Good plan,&quot; agreed Eagrus, and they opened their RC&#39;s trapdoor, ready to bomb anybody using the corridor below.<br><br>***<br><br>DoSAT:<br><br>Sigma One smiled. Her redecoration of the ship she had helped commandeer was coming along nicely. Satisfied with the job so far, she cracked off the tops of two more paint-tins (black and green, naturally), and drew her paintbrush ready to commence the next phase.<br><br>A large number of pillows suddenly appeared, and evil cackle just preceding them. Sigma looked up. That sounded like a challenge to a cackling contest if ever she heard one. She took a deep breath in... and noticed where the pillows had landed: right in the paint tins, splashing paint everywhere and ruining her hard work.<br><br>She screamed instead, and grabbed a paint-covered pillow, determined to catch whoever it was who had cackled. Joke was her top suspect. Time to pay Cyba&#39;s RC a visit, and whoever got in the way in between.<br><br>***<br><br>DMSE&amp;R:<br><br>&quot;We will bring order to your chaos,&quot; stated Caprt and Captin One of Five, and started towards the mini-Discord.<br><br>A moment later, Phi Six came diving out of her sideroom, grabbed both of them by their metal-plated dog-tails, and pulled them both out of range or their intended target.<br><br>&quot;Oh no you DON&#39;T!&quot; she scolded them, even as the third mini teleported up to the ceiling, conjured up a pile of pillows and dropped them all over the trio below. Phi chucked one back, missed, and the mini-Discord vanished with a cackle.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; decided Phi. &quot;If this is happening to anybody else too, we need backup. Let&#39;s go find Cyba and Sigma!&quot;<br><br>With that, she put Caprt and Captin on her shoulders, armed herself with pillows in case of further attack, and started off down the corridor.</p>

            <p>A pair of DIA officers on patrol nearby received a call on their radio. Fire Flash, a red-and orange maned yellow Earth pony, poked her earpiece with a hooftip to answer.<br><br>&quot;Unit five-oh-two here. What&#39;s up, Central?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve got a code three-by-ten-by-ladybug-by-concrete going on in Rudi&#39;s pub. Get down there and make sure the situation doesn&#39;t get out of hand, but just make sure they clean up after themselves. Central out,&quot; said the voice over the radio.<br><br>Fire Flash looked up to her partner, a towering protoss High Templar. &quot;Central reports a code three-by-&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Ten-by-ladybug-by-concrete. I can read your thoughts just fine, thank you,</i>&quot; replied her partner telepathically.<br><br>The mare aimed a half-hearted kick at her partner&#39;s digitigrade legs. &quot;Get outta my brain, Lunkhead. And what does that code mean anyways?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>There is a pilowfight going on in Rudi&#39;s. Come along,</i>&quot; replied Taldaris, walking to the doors to the pub as he straightened his black robes.<br><br>When the duo arrived on the site, the pub was already a battleground of flying pillows and duelling agents. A stray pillow flew into Taldaris&#39; face, who barely flinched as it somehow exploded into a cloud of generic white fluffy feathers.<br><br>&quot;<i>I say,</i>&quot; said the protoss as he plucked the feathers from his robes. &quot;<i>This is quite a spirited pillow fight, is it not? Fire Flash? Hello?</i>&quot; His partner was nowhere to be seen, but the High Templar was convinced he spied a braided red-orange mane bob up and down in the crowd a few metres away.<br><br>The Patrol officer looked from left to right. The entire pub was a writing mass of pillows and feathers. He decided to wait this one out; there was no need to get involved in this. <br><br>His opinion on the matter changed quite rapidly as he found himself to be the target of many &quot;stray&quot; pillows and a few whacks at his abdomen. The protoss eventually decided to throw off his inflexible demeanour-- just this once, and hurled a pillow at an elleth. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t remember how they did it in OFUM/HFA, but that sounds a little easier than an actual co-write. <br>As to the crossover name--it&#39;s not like it&#39;s official, but I think it should be Treklock. See <i>Trek</i>verse, <i>Trek</i>nology, <i>Trek</i>nobabble, and <i>Trek</i>kie/Trekker. <br>Also, can we coin the phrase &quot;The Cumberbatch Connection&quot; for the connection between Star Trek, LOTR, and Sherlock? </p>

            <p>It&#39;s like all roads lead to Rome: all fandoms lead to Cumberbatch.<br><br>They had something where students from OFUM went to HFA, and vice versa. Stuff like translators were provided, and the staff of the other OFUs berated them for making erroneous connections (Draco Malfoy not being an elf, Gollum not being a house elf, etc) and the students ha to avoid literal pitfalls. </p>

            <p>Speaking of references to OFUM, you may be interested to know that there&#39;s a psychic Wall of Mazarbul (also known as the Wall of Mazarbaaaargh) possibly residing in the bathroom with the Witch-Wall. At least, that&#39;s where the agents dropped it. It spawned in this bit of mission:<br><blockquote>
<blockquote><i>They stumbled across a wall that Gandalf discovered to be the record of the fate of Balin&#39;s folk.</i></blockquote>&quot;Yeah, because the pile of dead Dwarves wasn&#39;t enough to clue them in,&quot; Diocletian muttered sarcastically. The other agents, though, were more interested in what appeared to be the Wall of Mazarbul. Since it was given not much in the way of description, it appeared to be the entire Book of Mazarbul chiseled into a rather handsome piece of granite, complete with the trailing &quot;they are coming&quot; carved by what must have been a Dwarf extremely dedicated to stonework.<br><br>Nume leaned in with an arched eyebrow, giving every evidence of reading the wall. &quot;The castle of . . . aaaaargh,&quot; he groaned with a ghoulish grin. &quot;He must have died while carving it.&quot;<br><br>Ilraen blinked. &quot;But if he were dying, he would not bother to carve &#39;argh.&#39; He would just say it.&quot;<br><br>Nume&#39;s grin fell away. &quot;Damn it, Ilraen, I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re paraphrasing or just clueless.&quot;<br><br>It was Ilraen&#39;s turn to show his teeth—even a disguise couldn&#39;t teach someone who habitually had no mouth to grin properly, but the message was clear.<br><br>Suicide contented himself with a golf clap.<br><br>In defiance of the agents&#39; increasingly desperate attempts to keep their sanity, Archir stood in front of the Wall of Mazarbaaargh and, being as special as he was, had clairvoyant visions of what had happened to the Dwarves who made their last stand.<br>
</blockquote>They thought the Witch-Wall might like a companion. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve yet to receive a reply, though.<br><br>I could&#39;ve sworn Bilbo was at OFUM, but I&#39;m not so sure about Smaug. Still, OFUM is definitely in need of an update because seriously with the release of the Hobbit I am predicting Fifteenth Walker Sues (can we get Elrond in on Fundamentally Fourteen?) and Dwarf fan girls (Fili and Kili are too pretty for their own good).<br><br>I imagine any sort of OFU of Wilderland would be a sub campus of OFUM as a whole, like how the MBSFA is just the modern London campus of the BSFA (and I have the BSFA writer&#39;s blessing for the MBSFA).</p>

            <p>Smaug was at OFUM. He was a member of S.I.C.T.N.I.T.M, despite not fitting the criteria. Nobody wanted to turn him away, if I recall. Well, now he has no reason to join it at all.</p>

            <p>Hello fellow lurker-turned-Boarder, and welcome to the PPC. I see you&#39;ve already taken the liberty of disposing of your sanity by reading some of the legendary badfics. I myself have only read the first and last chapter of Celebrian, but I find myself listening to dramatic readings of legolas by laura more frequently than should be healthy. I also tell people to read My Immortal and watch the horror in their eyes as they see why I informed them of it. It&#39;s a pastime.<br><br>I see you&#39;ve been pointed to the right reading materials and loaded with blee-products for your endeavors into the dark side of fanfic, so here&#39;s a gift for your induction. It&#39;s a Utensil, usable as anything that can be classified as such. It could be a fork or a spoon or a pen or a crayon or even a  spork peyon, if such a thing exists. Have fun!</p>

Have some antifreeze, distilled from only the most idiotic lemmings (It&#39;s part of a new batch!) some peanut butter, an extra large eraser, and three bottle caps. Also, don&#39;t go down the seven-hundredth and twenty third corridor on the right too far - there&#39;s a velociraptor loose in there.

            <p>My brother is always ordering packages but they never have good bubble wrap in them. It&#39;s depressing. I also read the sporking of Land Before Time: Littlefoot x Cera (*shutters* that MURDERED my childhood) and legolas by laura. At least legolas by laura was funny because it was read verbatim on YouTube. My Immortal kind of just descends into random chaos after a while.</p>

            <p>Hmmm... I&#39;m not exactly sure how I discovered the PPC.  I must have gone on one of my spontaneous google binges and stumbled upon it. It&#39;s sad that I don&#39;t remember since it was not all that long ago.  I&#39;m sorry if I posted an answer to this question twice; I thought I posted an answer but then I couldn&#39;t see it so I wrote it again.</p>

            <p>Hi, and welcome! First of all, you need to read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">The Constitution</a>, which is very very important.

            <p>I went right in for it. I guess I&#39;m some sot of fanfic adrenaline junkie. I read so much fanfiction from a million different fandoms. I&#39;ve written stories for Final Fantasy 7, Twilight(smh. I&#39;ve got a serious love-hate relationship with that fandom), To Kill a Mockingbird, and The Magnificent Seven. I read all of those plus NCIS, Criminal Minds, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, InuYasha, Naruto, X-men, Batman, and many, many more. It&#39;s terrible sometimes.</p>

            <p>I just finished reading OFUM last week, actually - and a marvellous tale it was, too. I still haven&#39;t figured out what the ultimate evil is, though, unless it is something like &#39;it is actually whatever you imagine it to be&#39;. Is there any more of OFUM 2 somewhere? I bet the fangirls&#39; faces would be a picture when they see the mess the Canons made on their little escapade...<br><br>I guess I never expected to see you on the Board. Why, I&#39;m half-expecting to see Jay and Acacia show up, now.<br><br>I would probably class myself as a new/mid-bie - I&#39;ve been around long enough to get permission and write six missions, but I&#39;ve not yet been here for a year.<br><br>I also thoroughly thank you for inventing minis. They are such amusing little critters, and there is so much fun to be had with them. My agents have found quite a number during their missions, and have adopted a few (who are causing shenanigans in the interlude I am currently writing).<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m honored to meet you, Miss Cam!</p>

            <p>Well, after my little...informal greeting in the IRC chat (I just wanted to see how you all worked, I did not mean to take over discussion like that!) and properly embarrassed myself both with my mobile/tablet/lump-of-garbage acting up and my inability to spell, I decided once I had a proper computer, I would introduce myself! Properly!<br><br>I&#39;ve been lurking around the wiki for about, oh, two weeks, reading sporkings, and chuckling at the antics of Agents, when last night I decided to see the community in action. How interesting that someone else that same day decided to do the exact same thing. I have a feeling that if we ever become agents, she&#39;ll probably be my partner. Well, I&#39;ll leave that to the Flowers that Be (look at the newbie, using PPC terms) if I ever get the chance.<br><br>To answer the questions I know you are going to ask: I found you guys on TV Tropes while looking at Protecters of the Multiverse for a potential story I was writing/planing, thought the premise was humorous and noble to say the least, and decided to see if you sporked some Friendship is Magic badfic. You did. KittyNoodles, love your work so far, I loved the sporking of Rainbow Factory. I have to wonder, how would Caroline react to the goodfic Fallout Equestria? Anyway, sidetracking. I already know about the wiki (duh), I have read Da Rules, and got through about a third of the original series. There were only so many &#39;secial gurl join da Felloseep, and has one or mor o the felloshiep fall in wuv wit hur,&#39; with subsequent murdering of said Sue. I intend to finish the seres at some point, but school and new fics/sporkings come first.<br><br>As for the name, it&#39;s in reference to that story I was thinking about making. If you want more information, I would be happy to share, but without some serious changes in his character, I have a Gary Stu on my hands <br>(But I don&#39;t have women falling in droves to woo me! I was not even going to GET a romantic partner!)<br>Sorry, with your powers, you&#39;d STILL be a Stu.<br>(Curses.)<br>I know.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m glad I gathered the courage to finally able to introduce myself, and semi-dedicate myself to this little community.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the belated welcome, but Real Life has decided that for the entire month of December I should have no free time whatsoever. So. Here I am. On with the spiel. <br><br>Welcome a-Board, newbie! I see you&#39;ve already settled yourself into our ranks and added your own brand of crazy to our sanity-free community (well, not really sanity free, just sanity lacking). I can&#39;t say that I share your interest in MLP, but Doctor Who is one of my more recent obsessions, so I will happily chat endlessly with you about such things if you so wish. <br><br>On that note, have some salt, pepper and arsenic shakers.

Wait...<br><br>This is quite the warm welcome, with you self professed grammar Nazis putting up with me and my spelling inefficiency (though I am trying), even giving me things to role-play with.

Still, I feel thankful, and hopefully can find the darn poem. It&#39;s by my friend Jacob, about love, life and depression. It&#39;s very well written, but I semi-ruined it for myself when I thought about how the girl may be a Mary Sue. Argh.</p>

            <p>Hello, World-Jumper! Welcome to our fine Board! Here, have some Bleepnerds. They come in urple and glose!<br><br>Also: Somebody read my sporking before joining up (or at least while they were doing the required reading)? I... hee~<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m glad you liked the sporking - although, since Riese helped me write the second half, I can&#39;t take all the credit for the mission being as good as it is (or for managing to stay sane the whole way through.) Might I suggest you check out WarriorJoe&#39;s sporking of Cupcakes, too? It&#39;s excellently done (and better than mine, really.)<br><br>Since Agent!Caroline is PPC!me, I can safely say that she knows Fallout Equestria exists, but chooses not to read it for the same reasons she wanted to destroy &#39;In which pony juicers kill my soul&#39;. Most likely she&#39;ll end up peeking at it out of curiosity during an interlude, and then we shall see what she/I think/s of it. :)</p>

            <p>I was waiting for you to show up! Even though you&#39;re new compaired to the others, you still make some of the best sporkings (at least that I have read) as well as creating very strong characters. Hope to see more of your work in the future.<br>Now, if you realy want to freak out, I personaly enjoyed reading your two sporks and interludes than the original series. No I&#39;m not kissing up...<br>(Yeah  you are.)<br>Shoosh.<br><br>Yes I did read the Cupcakes spork, as I said earlyer. You can scroll down if you want my opinion on it, but the tl;dr version: I liked it.<br><br>Well, if you DO ever read Fallout Equestria, I would love to read &#39;your&#39; reaction. I will say, it is very dark, but very very well written. The charicters are fairly strong, and the author somehow makes &#39;Equestria post nuciar apocalypse&#39; make sence. Give it a shot, and be sire to read at least five chapters before jugeing TOO hard.<br><br>Ooh, blee...nerds? What in the name of Celestia was Wonka thinking? Oh well, thanks. I&#39;m sure the sweet blast back into sanity will be helpfull.</p>

            <p>...I dont know what to say, other than THANK YOU!!! While I am not usualy a fan of first person shooters, Halflife was one of the best games I have ever played. Gabe, if you don&#39;t make episode three soon... I&#39;ll just wait some more, like we have so far.<br><br>Alright, enough of that silliness. Yes, I&#39;ve read the Cupcakes killing, and I must say, I cheered when Pinkamena&#39;s neck broke and all was well. That was a fantastic sporking, and I loved every moment of it. Actually, I&#39;ve read ALL the MLP:FIM sporkings, because I had a compulsive need to read what agents had to say about my *little* fandom.<br><br>However, for my character OUTSIDE of the PPC, I was presented with a conundrum. You see, Pinkamena was going to be one of his enemies, because he helped create her. He saw the signs in pinkie as a young filly, about three months after she got her cutie mark. While she was great with parties, a rock farm required her to do more work that she just could not do as well as the others. Because rock framing is a very hard lifestyle (pun not really intended, but welcome) her father started to yell at her for not picking up the slack. He never hit her or anything like that, just rough on her. <br>She started to go insane, and scared about one of the dreams she had one night: her standing over the body her father, a bloody knife in her mouth. Jumper, visiting to collect some stones he needed for ...something, tried to prevent Cupcakes from happening. Instead, he split Knife-happy Pinkamena from cannon Pinkie, and fought her, hoof and nail, trying to kill her. All the fics and popularity kept her from dyeing though, so he locked her inside a different grimdark version of Equestria, to be forgotten. <br>Each pony (or person, depending if she found her way into another universe) she killed, he found as his responsibility. The blood may not be on his hands, but the mark rested on his soul. However, I wanted him to interact with the PPC. If you killed the original fic, Pinkamena&#39;s life support essentially failed, and the whole Pinkamena plot line I thought of was useless. Still, I found a solution, I think, but no need to get into that now.<br><br>Oh, so you also sent an agent into the dreaded Factory? Which one, the intelligence report, or the extra agent who was called in in the second half? Either way, I loved it, and you did a good job helping to kill that blasted thing.<br><br>...Yes I like to ramble. Got a problem with that?</p>

            <p>As for what I enjoy, any game made by Valve, The Elder Scrolls (spesificaly oblivion and skyrim), Fable, LOTR (not as much as you lot though), the Inheritance Cycle (deal with it), Doctor Who, Warcraft to an extant, Warehouse 13 though I&#39;ve missed a lot of it, Minecraft, and while it&#39;s not nessicraly what you&#39;re asking for, the SCP-foundation. I&#39;m sure there are more, but that&#39;s all I can think of at the moment. If you were asking for fandoms I am a part of, however, basicaly just the brony fandom, with dabblings in the Portal and Doctor Who fandoms.</p>

            <p>I was a fan of fable for a while, but when I found the moding community for fable one, I was hooked. I was testing so many mods, though I could not make any myself. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve played it though, having moved on to other games. Still, a very fun game. Good times, good times...</p>

            <p>Hey there, Jumper! I&#39;m Sevenswans, and school has eaten my life as well. The last newbie got my vial of antifreeze (distilled from the Lemmings of the Circle of Lemmings,) so you&#39;re going to have to deal with string, a pocket-sized model of the Taj Mahal, three oranges and a roll of Gaff tape as your introductory gift. <br><br>Your name actually makes me think about some stories I wrote, back in the day - and a story I&#39;m still writing, where the multiverse is vast and traveling it is a pain in the ass that people actually do undertake on a fairly regular basis. Also, I&#39;ve co-written or run writing workshops for several years now, so I&#39;m fairly good at rehabbing borderline sue&#39;s and stus, if you wanted to throw any info at someone.<br><br>Welcome to the board! Watch out for the Lemmings, we seem to be flooded in the little beasts...</p>

Oh come on, I travel to worlds represented by fiction, I need the work of fiction to travel there, therefore with a pocket dimension, I have a library that contains every written work, published or not, so I can travel and learn! It&#39;s like the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS, but cooler for me!)<br>...Yeah, either you&#39;re not getting it, or you are going to have to take Apocrypha from Hermaeus Mora by force, which would confirm your status as a Gary Stu.<br>(...We&#39;ll work on it.)<br>Indeed.<br><br>Thanks for the gifts, I know there are plenty of things one can use... Gaff tape? It it like duct tape? Still, perhaps I can MacGyver something with this stuff. Or make orange juice. Whatever.<br>As for the help with the character, I would very much appreciate it. While I don&#39;t have a huge amount of time at the moment, I would be happy to provide more information about who he is, and how I wanted to use him later.</p>

I must admit, I could not get into D&amp;D, table tops just take too long when the entire group is learning how to play. However, RPG video games, expeshaly The Elder Scrolls, are just too much fun. While I almost always play a good, knight-in-shining-armor type character as my main, the Daedric Princes&#39; quests are always worth doing, especially Sheogorath. After becoming a brony though, I wondered what would happen if either Sheogorath and Discord met, or if they switched places. What a perfectly maddening, chaotic prospect that would be...<br><br> Unfortunately, I have not played as much of the elder scrolls as I would like. I beat Oblivion, game of the year edition with my Divine Crusader Paladin, and managed to get fairly well through with my evil and Sheogorath-want-to-be characters, but then I lost the disks and I am sad :(. <br><br>Still, thanks, and I hope to be able to interact with you guys more in the future.</p>

            <p>As I assume a good deal of you know, I have been threatening the board with a second permission attempt for at least a few weeks now.<br><br>Well, after some time to think it over, I&#39;ve decided that I am actually not going to try for permission again.<br><br>This isn&#39;t just some spur of the moment thing to cause unnecessary drama. I&#39;ve thought good and hard on this.<br><br>My reasoning is simple: I lack the maturity in skill, my writing style is too whimsical to accommodate the structured, if wacky nature of mission writing, and I just don&#39;t have the capacity to write missions on my phone.<br><br>With Christmas coming around the bend soon, I could end up with a tech upgrade; but that still leaves me hanging on the other two points. I just can&#39;t make myself think like an Agent - I think too much like SC: cynical, snarky, not-entirely-on-point, always preoccupied with other thoughts, etc.<br><br>However, this doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t write; I love doing MSTs. In fact, part three of my Narnia MST is almost done. So I&#39;ll definitely be doing MSTs whenever I can. <br><br>And hey: the rules do say that I can plug stories as well. I probably won&#39;t do that as much, but definitely keep an eye out if you follow me on DA.<br><br>I felt the need to let people know because I&#39;ve been very talkative about permission and missions and agents for a while now, and this suddenly clicked in my head. I like READING stuff by the PPC, and I enjoy being on the board - but I don&#39;t think I can bring myself to write for the PPC. That&#39;s something for those more apt than I.<br><br>So, to summarize: I&#39;m not going for permission, but by all means, send fics my way to MST, I&#39;m all up for that.</p>

            <p>No, seriously - the Cult Of The Mission-Writer is so strong these days I&#39;m actually impressed to see someone consciously choose not to join it.

            <p>For the record? I applied for permission way back when, and then commenced to write absolutely nothing PPC-related for the better part of five years. <i>At least</i>. There&#39;s no pressure on you whatsoever to write PPC stuff alone - or even at all, to be honest. We don&#39;t kick people out for deciding not to go that route.<br><br>I think I said - I hope so, anyway - that quite a bit of the stuff on your Deviant Art had potential. I don&#39;t make a good agent type, either, and I know I never will. I write stuff like <a href="http://thulcandran.dreamwidth.org/13312.html">this</a>, and I just can&#39;t stomach the idea of ripping someone else&#39;s story apart with an agent. But nobody&#39;s ever tried to force my hand to writing one, or anything like that. There&#39;s no reason why anyone here should feel pressured to write in a way they don&#39;t want to - so stick around, write as you will and never be afraid to plug it here*, and see where the road takes you!<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re sticking around, and glad you don&#39;t feel pressured or upset about this whole deal; I look forward to seeing where your works go in the future.</p>

            <p>Serious question. Because spelling is usually using the <i>wrong</i> letter, not the wrong <i>form</i> of it.

            <p>THIS isn&#39;t an error if it&#39;s done on purpose (and it would be hard to type a solitary word in uppercase any other way), but This could be if you accidentally whacked the Shift key while typing, or something like that. Though, I think capitalization errors are more akin to spelling errors than anything else, even though they aren&#39;t exactly the same. In both cases, it&#39;s the wrong letter <i>character</i>.<br><br>And anyway, improper capitalization does create minis. {= )<br><br>(What is ultratonication?

            <p>I have been following the discussion about the possible change and evolution of missions with interest, and I will definitely try to challenge myself more with future missions. That said, this mission is rather traditional.

            <p>I&#39;ve only ever seen Labyrinth once, but that was enough to know just how horribly OOC this fic was in the majority of particulars. I love the agent dynamic as well - Saxo and James are a delightful antithesis to each other and the bickering was spot-on. :D<br><br>I sort of hope Saxo never runs into my DIC Agent, William Marshall - William&#39;s a half-blood, pro-Muggle Auror and a survivor of both Wizarding Wars. That would probably get very messy indeed. :P (Actually, I think I lied when I said I hope they don&#39;t meet. It would be entertaining. XD)<br><br>My only niggle is that in the charge list I noticed a persistent mistyping. &quot;Mudblood&quot; should be capitalised, as JKR always did it. Other than that, it was a delight to read.</p>

            <p>Oh man, now I&#39;m so tempted to suggest some sort of entertaining interlude where they meet up, possibly in a crowded area, and discover each other&#39;s loyalties, just to see what kind of fallout would occur.

            <p>That was fun. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the agents interact - and was convinced that they were who they were supposed to be. James&#39; semi-quoting and generally Sir-Didymus-y character was particularly eye-catching.<br><br>There were also some lines that really amused me: &quot;Trust Snape to have a well stocked laboratory wherever he goes. Trust him on nothing else, but trust him on this.&quot;<br><br>And the whole thing with Saxo and Lord Tomdemort near the end - that was a brilliant character moment. I applaud you.<br><br>On the flip side, there were some fairly clumsy paragraphs. The following caught my eye:<br><br>&quot;James scooped up the mini-Aragog, slitherin, like he had seen Mittens do many times and tried to place it in the backpack. Apparently he lacked Mittens’ skills, for slitherin wiggled in his arms and when he tried to stuff it in the backpack, it bit him. In the end he had to be content with letting it ride on top of the backpack.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s three instances of &#39;backpack&#39; in as many sentences, and it did break the flow (to the point where I copied it to mention it). But it was the only one which hit me that hard. In general, this is a problem that can be solved by synonyms (&quot;rucksack&quot; or &quot;bag&quot;) or just rewording (&quot;letting it ride on top.&quot;)<br><br>As to the epilogue... that was pretty darn meta. Fun, though. And an interesting way of solving the problem. ;) I also liked the reappearance of James &amp; Saxo at the end - a nice closure to (this piece of) their tale.<br><br>All in all, fun times! Thank you for writing that.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Ah!  You found a perfect crossover for James and Saxo to mission in together!  With parts of each agent&#39;s home canon being defiled, they each had reason to set aside their differences and work together, if only for a little while.  (Also, man, do I love reading their lines in the voices I imagine for them.)<br><br>That perfectly logical reason for teamwork, combined with the shortness of the mission, gave it some real velocity.  This was a good choice, as the sheer idiocy of the canon&#39;s out-of-character natures meant that little evidence was really required by the reader to see that this was a badfic.  That pace really pays off at the end, when the mission seems to be about to end like every other . . . and then you slam your reader with Saxo&#39;s internal plan to off his partner and recast himself as a major shaker in the Potterverse.  It hits with the force of a runaway train, and it really does seem like such an easy thing to do . . . the choice doesn&#39;t seem like it has an obvious solution, so I really was left wondering if Saxo would at least try . . .<br><br>His final realization that he really has nothing to go back to is a major turn in Saxo&#39;s personality.  I suspect he&#39;ll be a bit more into PPC agency, at least for a little while . . . but I have to wonder if he&#39;ll get such an itch again.  Also, whether James will have a similar &quot;moment&quot; where he realizes that his new PPC life really is for life.<br><br>Oh, there&#39;s an epilogue.  I must get to bed now, but I shall read that tomorrow night and comment again, hopefully.  But first!  Errors!<br><br>&quot;&#39;Yes. Then we can go back to ripping each <b>others</b> throats out.&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the fic it turned out, that <b>is</b> was actually Tom Riddle, who wanted the help of Jareth and his goblins in the war against the wizarding world.<br><br>&quot;James scowled at the scene and picked up <b>hogmead</b>, the mini-Aragog.&quot;  <i>Here we are, the true sign of the PPC&#39;s maddening nature: You&#39;ve misspelled the misspelling hogmaed (unless it got copy-pasted wrong in the badfic quote just before this line.)</i><br><br>&quot;<b>The</b> was another mini-Aragog, Wesley.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There’s another mini. <b>It’s</b> must be ‘Deatheaters’.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In desperation, he <b>Apperated</b> to the first location that crossed his mind.&quot;  <i>It&#39;s &quot;Apparated,&quot; with three a&#39;s.</i></p>

            <p>... that something like the short-lived <b>hogmead</b>, as a typo by you for the mini <b>hogmaed</b>, would by a mini-mini-Aragog, and therefore either a very small spider (&#39;regular sized&#39;) or, potentially, a full-sized Aragog (which would explain why it is a very bad idea to make them). A misspelling of the <i>breed of mini</i>, however, is you misnaming a certain class of typo - you made an error in naming &#39;spelling a name wrong&#39;, essentially.

            <p>But for anyone interested in cowriting with me my fandoms are the Tolkienverse, Harry Potter, Narnia, Axis Powers Hetalia, BBC Sherlock (and other Sherlock Holmes adaptations/the ACD canon), and Battlestar Galactica 2003.<br><br>Along with other minor ones like Inception and Gattaca and all those other films but that can probably be figured out on a case-by-case basis.

            <p>1) That people try to sexualize dragons in the first place. Honestly, biology is what, freshman year of high school? Also, Tolkein dragons are <i>not</i> nice. I mean, you could possibly have an excuse in Earthsea, where they can take human form if they want to...<br><br>2) Can you imagine a dragon in Hobbiton? I was actually just reading the Hobbit (again, my mother is using it for her class&#39; English assignment and keeps asking me which dwarf is which,) and a very loose paraphrasis of one of the lines where Bilbo almost decides not to go adventuring basically reads as &quot;he thought of dragons arriving in Hobbiton,&quot; and it wasn&#39;t a good thing. <br><br>3) How haven&#39;t I been reading this? Sherloaf Holmes indeed! (I&#39;ve always been tempted to try writing the Red Leech or the Politician, the Trained Cormorant and the Aluminum Cruch myself - seriously, there&#39;s so much room in this fandom for OC&#39;s if they&#39;re clients...) Also, I like the idea of people attending multiple fandom universities. I mean, it&#39;s kind of sad if you assume that people just don&#39;t learn their lesson, but on the other hand, I&#39;d attend several of them on purpose if I could. (I do have some distinct advantages - since I don&#39;t drool over anyone I wouldn&#39;t get mauled quite so frequently. :) )<br><br>4) You know, your OFUM feeds its students way better than my university does. (Even if Sherlock and John are like college students in that they live on takeout and whatever has taken up residence in the fridge...)<br><br>5) Damn. Now I want to write an Earthsea crossover where Sherlock is able to deduce the true names of things. Very, very useful for a wizard, but on the other hand, they&#39;d both need use-names and I&#39;m terrible at those... I could name Sherlock &quot;Hemlock&quot; or something, but that seems like it would be way too predictable. No clue what John would be yet, besides there and taking it all in stride. :)</p>

            <p>It was a great idea to have Smaug and Bilbo drop in. Not only because it made for genuinely funny scenes, but also because it helps to give a feeling of connection between the different OFUs.<br>On one hand I hope you will be doing more, but on the other hand it was such a great lecture and really set the rules for any kind of crossover, so I understand if this is the only one.<br><br>And now I want Superwholockvengers goodfic ...</p>

            <p>This really is a neat take on the PPC. It makes so much sense that a guy like this is wandering around.

            <p>Well, &quot;found&quot; isn&#39;t the right word. This morning, I got a notice in my inbox that one of my old fics had been added to somebody&#39;s favorites, so I went to scope them out. In their Favorite Stories, there are <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2751357/">1000+ Potterfics</a> that all seem to be about Snape and original characters. I warn you, it&#39;s slightly mind-boggling to look at so many in one place. O.o<br><br>I have no idea what kind of quality we&#39;re really looking at here, since I haven&#39;t had the courage to click on anything. The summaries do seem to be relatively well written at a glance, though. I guess it&#39;s possible that there are that many decent Snape fics with OCs in the world, but knowing the quality of mine, I&#39;d guess mediocre at best. Plus, I&#39;ve just spotted one where the OC is a werecat (&quot;Teacher&#39;s Pet&quot; by MissBlackthorne). That can&#39;t be good...<br><br>On a personal note: I&#39;ve been <i>collected</i>. That&#39;s so weird. O.o<br><br>(Sadly, I&#39;ve only seen the first season of <i>Avatar</i>, and from the other comments, it seems like both seasons are involved.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Considering that there&#39;s been so much damage done to the setting of this - not really the characters, aside from Korra having way too short a lifespan (Avatars usually last centuries, and Aang died young because he spent that century in an iceberg), and Sokka (a nonbender) having strong bender offspring (How is John Watson Sokka&#39;s descendant? They look nothing alike, and - ugh, nevermind.)

            <p>I&#39;m thinking of going for permission eventually, and I&#39;ve been trying to come up with two good, well-developed agents. I have one agent who I think is pretty good, OC wise, but as for Ava.... I&#39;m worried that Ava may be a bit too sue-ish. I don&#39;t know if this is against the rules, but I just want to hear any suggestions that anyone might have for making Ava a better character.<br><br>Name: Ava Brooks (Full Name: Ava Mary Brooks)<br><br>Physical Appearance: Ava is of average weight. She has shoulder length copper ringlets. Big brown eyes, full-ish lips She&#39;s tall. She is fifteen years old. She wears glasses in order to read.<br><br>Personality: Ava is an optimist, very positive. She&#39;s loyal and makes friends easily. She&#39;s of average intelligence. She can be a bit vain, sort of self centered. She can be selfish and very dramatic. Over-reacts VERY easily, hates getting dirty. She wasn&#39;t to be a doctor, loves to read, does ballet and writes as a film critic in her school paper. She&#39;s a potterhead, loves LOTR and has read Twilight as part of a study on Mary Sues, and she hates it. Her favorite color is pink (&quot;I can&#39;t help it that the Sues love it, it&#39;s a nice color!&quot; ~ Ava) Glitter annoys her.<br><br>Back story: She joined the PPC because her cousin, Katie, is a DMS agent, who said she could join when she turned fifteen. Ava is from the real world, Australia, and she has two older brothers and two little sisters.<br><br>Is Ava sue-ish? If so, how can I improve. I don&#39;t want to change her character entirely, but anything anyone can advise?</p>

            <p>I do sort of like that idea. Maybe she could be a frequent visitor to medical, maybe even to the point of transferring if Mary Sues doesn&#39;t work out, not quite sure. But that certainly is an idea, would be some nice development, and I would like that a lot.</p>

            <p>The description &quot;copper ringlets&quot; smells a bit purple to me, as opposed to &quot;curly red hair&quot; or something like that. It&#39;s just one description, and not a problem by itself, but lavish, overblown catalogs of the OC&#39;s appearance is a writing feature commonly associated with Sues. They have orbs where there should be eyes; they have waterfalls where there ought to be hair; they have rosebuds where lips should be; they have porcelain instead of skin; etc. Figurative language is fine now and then, but if it comes up all the time, it adds up to some very impractical and inhuman-looking characters.

If not, why is this important? If so, how come she joins the PPC instead of going to college to study medicine? Is she signing up for Medical, perhaps? We haven&#39;t had too many stories set there, and definitely not from a staff member&#39;s point of view, so that could be fun.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Or maybe you just span off into a bit of unrelated advice... but &#39;copper ringlets&#39; isn&#39;t really figurative language. Ringlets are a specific type of curls, and copper is a specific shade of red.<br><br>I can see that if it was mentioned every time the hair was described, &#39;copper ringlets&#39; or, say, &#39;golden tresses&#39; would get irritating - but then, so would &#39;blonde waves&#39;, &#39;mousey curls&#39; or &#39;straight black hair&#39;.<br><br><i>Agent Remora stood in her Response Centre, running her fingers through her straight black hair. &quot;What&#39;s this all about, then?&quot; she murmured.<br><br>The console didn&#39;t answer. Remora tugged on a lock of her straight black hair thoughtfully. &quot;Well, maybe I should get someone from DoSAT down,&quot; she mused. She shook her head rapidly, her straight black hair flying out. &quot;No, not after the Incident. Oh, well.&quot;<br><br>She reached down to tap the &#39;off&#39; button - and received a massive electric shock which made her straight black hair stand on end. &quot;Owwww...&quot; she muttered.</i><br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter whether I say &#39;generic fibrous head-covering&#39; or &#39;luscious crystal-golden waterfall&#39;, that was a badly-written scene. But &#39;straight black hair&#39; isn&#39;t a bad phrase in and of itself.<br><br>Anyway, straying from the point. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with the description &#39;copper ringlets&#39;, provided the author doesn&#39;t fall in love with it and use it every other paragraph.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that my first thought on reading it was particularly shiny, sleek, metallic, and styled. On the heels of this was my second thought, which was small rings of actual copper instead of hair. But yes, it&#39;s entirely possible that it&#39;s a cultural thing, or maybe I&#39;m the only person on the planet that thinks that way, even.

            <p>It sounds like we have different exposure to the word &#39;ringlets&#39;. Without checking... no, scratch that, I <i>will</i> check.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringlet_(haircut)">Wikipedia</a> claims the style dates back to roughly the burning of the Temple in Jerusalem (AD 70), and has wandered around ever since. For the most part, it seems to evoke a historical look - or a &#39;stuck-up little girl&#39; appearance, probably because of the historical associations.<br><br>So my suspicion is that you and I simply have different enough fields of reading that I&#39;ve come across the word a fair number of times, and you haven&#39;t as much. So I think of it as a normal description, and you see it as unusual. Both of us are right - we&#39;re just right in different contexts.<br><br>As to which context the PPC fits into, I think the only reasonable way to determine that is a duel to the deaf.

This could be a matter of different exposure, too, but my experience has been that it&#39;s mostly Sues that end up with golden tresses or silver waterfalls or whathaveyou, and the metallics do seem to go hand in hand with the more flowery language.

            <p>Springing off the previous discussion about Ava, it&#39;s possible that making her traits more specific will help. Say, she&#39;s loyal to her family, can be a bit vain and selfish, and makes friendly acquiantances easily, but might not have them as really good friends due to the aforementioned vanity and selfishness that shows up. <br><br>As far as her cousin, there are possible ways that you could play that (her idolizing her cousin and being naive to what the job actually entails, more than the cousin actively encouraging her, or possibly that her older cousin introduced her to fanfiction and mary sues before she joined the PPC, igniting a hatred of sues or something,) but as far as the rest of the family, I&#39;d like to know how having the siblings affects her personality and daily life. For example, being the middle child might reinforce the vain and selfish aspects, because she&#39;s looking for more attention. Or perhaps the siblings are why she can affect a cheerful demeanor and get along with people at a very basic acquaintance-type level without having any deeper friendship. <br><br>I have no idea why not wanting to be a doctor was on there. Does someone expect that of her? Was that something she previously wanted before she realized how much she hates messes? (I&#39;m also not sure why her activities are listed under personality, but that&#39;s just a formatting nitpick.) <br><br>It might be interesting if she thinks a lot of the PPCing like she would watching and critiquing a film, and then learns otherwise. Also, given that she&#39;s from world one, it might be convenient to have her be an intern so she wouldn&#39;t miss too much real world and school, like everyone else said. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m also rather iffy on how someone self-centered and vain can make friends easily, unless she&#39;s the sort of popular queen bee cheerleader-type of character who has an army of backstabbing &#39;friends&#39; and acquaintances. And loyalty usually calls for caring for more than the self, so... yeah, selfish might contradict that. <br><br>I&#39;d prefer to see a scenario written out before making any calls, but yeah, I can definitely see it going either way from here. I have an Agent who hates getting dirty, too, but I purposefully paired her with a slob for a partner because it&#39;s funnier that way.<br><br>I didn&#39;t know there was an age requirement for the PPC, to be honest, and having a relative already in the PPC hearkens a little too much towards Suedom - of course, it&#39;s fine to have siblings I suppose, but given that the PPC isn&#39;t exactly the Multiverse&#39;s best workplace, I find Katie encouraging her sister to join a bit questionable.<br><br>Have you considered letting her already be at the PPC as an intern? Cale Serfe, the other intern that I know of, is Ava&#39;s age. It&#39;s a way for her to get some mission experience with other Agent teams and to see exactly what she&#39;s getting into.</p>

            <p>She is selfish to a degree, like not &quot;backstabbing jerk&quot; selfish, but more to an annoying level. I kind of meant that she was a friendly person, very talkative (almost to the point of being annoying). She has a few CLOSE friends, and those are the ones that can deal with her- those are who she is loyal to, a really good friend underneath it all. She&#39;s vain about her looks, never misses the opportunity to look in the mirror, she&#39;s bossy and stuff, she likes to be the center of attention. But she isn&#39;t a mean person, and has a lot of friends, just not super close ones.</p>

            <p>I can see how being selfish, loyal, and friendly at the same is possible. Take RL!me for example. I am, at a very base level, a very, very, very selfish person. If I&#39;d act on instinct I&#39;ll just do what I want. However, I don&#39;t act on instinct. I tend to behave politely toward other people, even in a friendly way, because I believe I can&#39;t really expect other people to behave that way toward me if I don&#39;t behave that way toward them first. Add to that my tendency to stick to my friends through whatever bad things they go through, and you get a selfish but friendly and loyal person.</p>

            <p>I can see your point about selfish-loyal-friendly being possible. My main problem is with a different part of meow&#39;s description:<br><br><i>She&#39;s vain about her looks, never misses the opportunity to look in the mirror, she&#39;s bossy and stuff, she likes to be the center of attention.</i><br><br>I find it hard to believe &#39;she&#39;s bossy and stuff&#39; can be the same person as &#39;has a lot of friends&#39;.

Now, what&#39;s a flaw...?&quot;<br><br>She thought back over the PPC stories she&#39;d read, and nodded firmly. &quot;Liking pink,&quot; she decided. &quot;And, let&#39;s see, she can be vain - that&#39;s a good flaw - and, ooh! Bossy!&quot;<br><br>And so Lacksi crafted Agent Remora, blissfully unaware that her new agent had a completely contradictory personality...</i><br><br>(Note: Lacksidacksical is my Archetypical Newbie Boarder.

            <p>I&#39;m not finding it on a quick wiki-scan, but I seem to recall an article saying that the Flowers aren&#39;t keen on sending children/young teens on assassination missions.

A fifteen-year old Intel agent should be fine, but DMS or DBS might raise whatever the Flowers have as eyebrows.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that we (and by extension, HQ) don&#39;t get as many younger teens. There HAVE been younger agents, though, when we do get them—and they have the required writing chops. That&#39;s really what sets the bar, since older teens and tweens are more likely to have more writing experience, capabilities, and maturity. That&#39;s only most of the time, though. I think the youngest PPCer ever was ten or eleven, both in-universe and out. And this is part of the reason we insist on keeping the Board family-friendly. {= )<br><br>In any case, being fifteen wouldn&#39;t be an issue according to HQ. I don&#39;t think the Flowers actually care how old their employees are as long as they can get the job done. It sounded like it was Ava&#39;s cousin setting that requirement rather than them. I could easily see an older family member who&#39;s already an agent going &quot;Huh, this is actually kinda dangerous.

            <p>…on how you write her. The character profile seems balanced: she does have flaws. The only discrepancy I can see is a tendency to be self-centered while making friends easily. <br>So it all comes down to how you write her, because characters can have flaws and still be Sues. Bella Swan&#39;s clumsiness is a good example. It could be a flaw, but if I remember correctly all it does is allow her to trip in Edward&#39;s arms. As long as Ava&#39;s flaws are shown to actually be hinderances, then she won&#39;t be Sue-y. This has to do with the scenarios you put her in. If she hates getting dirty, and she always gets missions where she stays clean, that would be Sue-y (and also against all the PPC ideas of putting the agents into what will annoy them the most, e.g. Jay and Acacia beng sent into fics where Elrond and Boromir were OOC).<br>I should probably tell you that I do not have Permission myself.

            <p>You managed to nerd-snipe me with the saturn&#39;s rings question - I headed off to look it up, and according to my research, you don&#39;t measure diameter in meters squared. (They are about 73,000 km wide and start at about 7,000 km from Saturn, which is 60,268 km (radius,) so the rings&#39; area is approximately... Specs! I&#39;m supposed to be dun with the semester tomorrow! You made me do math! Bad Specs! [For those of you interested, the area of Saturn&#39;s rings is about 4.76 * 10^10, double that if you are asking about surface area (because the rings have a top and a bottom.]<br><br>And the death of this sue shall be sweet and justified, because <i>I am taking notes</i>. (Once again, I must thank you for going on this journey with me.)<br><br>Vid has something to say to the &quot;If you&#39;re taller you don&#39;t spend your days looking down,&quot; line.<br><br>&quot;Are you kidding? Have you <i>ever</i> tripped over a velociraptor!? I assure you, I have learned to <i>watch where I put my feet.</i>&quot;<br><br>This whole thing... yeah. Just. This. Fic. Needs. To. Die!</p>

            <p>First I get my computer killed, so I switch to our Wii, but then that went on the fritz, at this time I am using my Xbox internet browser and a friend&#39;s profile (my own ran out of live). To make things worse, the heater in my bus broke (I live in a converted city shortbus in my dad&#39;s side driveway) and its mother-Zogin&#39; cold in here. I swear I&#39;m developing a Murphionic Field, cause&#39; electronic things keep breaking around me.</p>

            <p>Some of it is canon, some of it is hypothetical, and some of it is just me squeeing, but Diane Duane is doing an OTP writing prompt month.<br><br>I literally inhaled my tea. Also, finding her journal, she&#39;s nice and funny and not scary at all! (Though I admit to nearly passing out when I checked the stats on my personal journal this morning and found out that she&#39;d showed up to one of my posts which mentioned her aliens as an example of truly alien species...)</p>
