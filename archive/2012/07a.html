            <p>Since the main characters don&#39;t really interact until the Avengers movie, I would say that it would be best to take something from that movie. What would you call those giant snake-like alien things? Because those might make good minis.</p>

            <p>Chitauri is the species, and encompasses everything from the giant things to the foot soldiers. Leviathan is the specific name for the giant space whales. At least, I think that&#39;s how it works.</p>

            <p>What the Avengers is, is basically a giant crossover between a bunch of the Marvel superheroes. Therefore the minis would be dealt with in the same manner as crossovers. I&#39;m not very strong on Marvel knowledge, so I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any constant monster in any of the heroes&#39; particular continua but the Chitauri would probably fit the bill.</p>

            <p>My tendency is to remember specific jokes, so jokes by, say, British characters, I&#39;ll remember distincly with the accent. Take, for example, the movie Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel (&quot;Here&#39;s an idea. Instead of a time machine that runs on karaoke and urine, maybe they could have one with a dial, with dates on it. Something crazy like that?&quot;) or Ferb from Phineas and Ferb (&quot;Well, it occurs to me that perhaps not all of the modifications I made are technically &#39;street legal&#39;.&quot;). Hilarious stuff (that&#39;s the tip of the iceberg, if you ask me), and the accents just sort of come with the humour.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the hat. *Puts it on at a jaunty angle and it promptly falls off again*<br>Eddings is reasonably good. His stories are pretty formula, but have attractions such as witty banter and reasonably interesting variants on generic characters. I prefer the Elenium to the Belgariad and don&#39;t really like The Dreamers, mostly due to a lot of very literal Deus Ex Machina.</p>

            <p>what&#39;s sometimes known as high fantasy; knights in shining armour, chivalry, magic of various sorts, and a hero who has to save the world with his motley companions.<br><br>His books&#39; fans tend to like them because the story is an easily recognisable one, the character archetypes are so strong they&#39;re almost parodies, and there is a lot of banter. Snarking it up is almost a prerequisite for an Eddings character, and even after ten years of re-reading his stuff it gets giggles out of me. :D<br><br>His fantasy books start with <i>The Belgariad</i> (five-book series) and <i>The Malloreon</i> (also five-book series) focusing on a boy called Garion who has a Destiny. There are two prequels, <i>Belgarath the Sorcerer</i> and <i>Polgara the Sorceress</i>, focusing on two of the other central figures in the series. Best to read the main books before you read them, though, as there are a lot of references to things from the main books.<br><br>The second lot of books focus on a knight named Sparhawk; they are two sets of three-book series, <i>The Elenium<i> and <i>The Tamuli</i>.<br><br>There is also a standalone book named <i>The Redemption of Althalus</i>, about the unusual life of a thief named Althalus (surprise :P ).<br><br>I personally recommend them; the Garion books get off to a slow start, but they&#39;re no less enjoyable for that.</i></i></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve heard of David Eddings maybe once, in passing, and I&#39;ve never read his works, but speech not being clearly marked as <i>someone&#39;s</i> drives me up the wall. If it starts out like so:<br><br>&quot;Hey Alice,&quot; Bob said as he stuck his head into his flatmate&#39;s room, &quot;what do you want to eat?&quot;<br><br>Alice waved her hand at him without looking up from her book. &quot;Eh, food.&quot;<br><br>Where not every line has &#39;said&#39; or a variant preceding/succeeding it but it&#39;s obvious because the action tag is relevant to the line of dialogue that shares its paragraph, that&#39;s ok, but if it eventually turns into:<br><br>&quot;No preferences?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not really.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So... takeout still ok?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If I have to eat one more dinner courtesy of McDonalds&#39; I&#39;m going to puke.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That <i>is</i> a preference! And anyway, I don&#39;t see what&#39;s so bad about their stuff.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, you wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br><br>etc etc etc it gets darn aggravating, because I have to check back up to when the dialogue was attributed, then count down every other line to see who&#39;s talking now and that knocks me out of the story like WHOA.

            <p>Some bits can get like that, but mostly it&#39;s possible to work it out. So one character will be arguing a very different point of view to the other, the only times I&#39;ve gotten confused was when I wasn&#39;t paying enough attention.</p>

            <p>Yeah, when it&#39;s back-and-forth arguing it&#39;s not really <i>too</i> hard to figure out. I still think of it as... maybe a bit lazy? Not adding in some action tags to show what the characters are doing, that is. Even if you can tell who&#39;s talking it turns into talking heads and then faceless voices after a while, that&#39;s part of the problem.</p>

            <p>Eh. What&#39;s their facial expression, tone of voice, body language that can be expressed without confusing the horse? What&#39;s their horse doing while the characters talk? What&#39;s around them that catches their eye? Maybe this is down to personal taste because I know I avoid writing too many lines of pure dialogue without action just because I don&#39;t like to read it, but (speaking as someone who&#39;s only seen movies wherein people ride horses) there are a lot of things people can do and notice while talking to someone and also on a moving horse, and I think there are too many to allow more than a couple (herein meant 2-3, 4 is pushing it) lines of dialogue-only paragraphs before an action breaks up the chatter.</p>

            <p>I agree, but I have a problem with using words like said. Normally, I describe an action, then have speech.<br>For example:<br>Alice turned smiling. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting you back so soon, Bob.&quot;<br>Bob steps forward and drops a bag on the floor. &quot;I didn&#39;t think it was that early.&quot;<br><br>This is probably a Bad Habit.</p>

            <p>Nooo, no no no, that is an excellent thing. Certainly better than abusing the various &#39;said&#39; replacements. Using a mix of &#39;&quot;I don&#39;t love you anymore,&quot; Alice said.&#39; and &#39;Bob dropped his mug of fresh coffee in shock. &quot;What?&quot;&#39; is best for variety, as is putting the tags both before and after the dialogue, but when I said &#39;action tags&#39; I meant the things like what you do there and like what I had my Bob doing in this latest example.</p>

            <p>So. I&#39;m almost done with the first story of my spinoff (finally!) and I realized this needed to be asked before I look for betas. <br><br>One of my two agents is a Smoker from L4D. Specifically, a sapient Smoker from a &#39;verse that broke all the L4D rules. (Hapless bit, killed to create angst, one of the agents assigned to his badfic felt sorry for him and rescued him. And, yes, this is loosely based on something I wrote once, though I turned it from mehfic into the baddest of badfics.)<br><br>Now here&#39;s my question. The hapless bits in most of the badfics I&#39;ve read, once they&#39;re rescued, revert to the rules of their own canon. So... I was wondering exactly how much the rules of the Left 4 Deadiverse would aply to him. I&#39;m thinking they should more than not, but... in his badfic of origin, he was as sapient as a human, and I&#39;m wondering how much of that would go away. </p>

            <p>Well, uh.  There are zero sapient zombies in L4D.  As in, not a single canon example, and solid proof that there can&#39;t be, simply by the way you get zombified in that canon.  In fact, I&#39;m fairly sure it&#39;s impossible to have a Smoker.  It would be the same as a random person who got turned into a zombie in Resident Evil holding onto their sapience.  It can&#39;t really be done.  I would recommend rethinking that agent entirely, simply because in the rule of his own canon, he&#39;s a mindless killing machine who strangles people to death and spews poison fumes. </p>

            <p><i>This includes some quotes from other posts in this thread.</i><br><br><br><br><br>AB: <b>So. I&#39;m almost done with the first story of my spinoff (finally!) and I realized this needed to be asked before I look for betas. <br><br>Now here&#39;s my question. The hapless bits in most of the badfics I&#39;ve read, once they&#39;re rescued, revert to the rules of their own canon. So... I was wondering exactly how much the rules of the Left 4 Deadiverse would aply to him. I&#39;m thinking they should more than not, but... in his badfic of origin, he was as sapient as a human, and I&#39;m wondering how much of that would go away.</b><br><br>[If you’ve read my PPC writings, then you’ll know that I do not categorically disapprove of non-human characters, even ones who should be villains. I had some questions that I posted when I started considering using Kelok as a character. WHEN I STARTED CONSIDERING.  Not when I’d almost completed a mission with him in it. By then he was my character, and my responsibility. So, really, this triggered my first concern. This is a fairly large question for Skelter, and it’s not been asked and answered yet.]<br><br><br><br><br>AB:<b> Jack&#39;s bad enough and he&#39;s not even close to canon.</b><br><br>[This tells me that you are aware that it is not easy to write a different kind of character, which is good. Although, I truly have a soft spot for Jack. He’s just completely adorable.]<br><br><br><br><br><br>AB: The problem with Skelter is that he&#39;s from an angstfluffle of a fic, in which the Specials were slowly changing back into normal human beings. (Or, ya know, dying if they were too mutated to revert, re: the Tank.) <b>Unfortunately, their human psyche came back before they reverted all the way, so they still had all the instincts, powers, and urges of an Infected... there was just a very human intelligence trapped inside this monster&#39;s body, having to cope with them. </b>(In retrospect, we&#39;d been writing entirely too much Vampire: the Masquerade at the time, and I think some of that might have seeped in.)<br><br><b>So now, he&#39;s a human intelligence, stuck in a Smoker&#39;s body, thinking of the PPC as his chance to be a superhero, and still with an unholy hunger for human flesh. This is not going to end well, obviously. (Meaning: it will be hilarious.)</b><br><br>[This is the part that I have serious concerns over, and where this character differs markedly from Jack. Jack is an intelligent Hunter that does not have the urge to snack on those around him (tackle and glomp--yes, snack on--no). Not the original personality stuffed into a monstrous body and bombarded with monstrous urges and desires. Anyone dealing with that situation would very quickly--and horrifically--lose their minds. Nothing hilarious about it. As this concept is presented here would represent, to me, one of the worst tortures that could be inflicted on a character. I would raise concerns of torture if someone did this to a Sue, and this is an agent character.]<br><br><br><br><br><br>AB: I think as long as he didn&#39;t get on the recieving end of a Canon Bomb or into the Reality Room, he ought to be okay. And to be honest he tends to stay OUT of his own canon for that very reason. (He doesn&#39;t want to go back to being a regular Smoker when canon fixes itself after the death of a Sue. Can you blame him?)<br><br>[Having a restriction on a character is not a bad thing. It can make them interesting as they try to work around their issues, and you can restrict the canons that a character goes to. As evidence of this: The All-Purpose Department.]<br><br><br><br><br><br>AB: <b>Sorry, friend. I shouldn&#39;t have been as harsh with you.

The subject seems to have been radically shifted, but for what reason I was not immediately sure. My first suspicion was that it had to do with dislike of the suggestion that you examine your characters. However, I have given your response quite a lot of thought before jumping into a reply of my own. <br><br>Firstly, I like slash. I read slash, and I have possibly written more missions dealing with slash than any other member that has posted to the Board within the last year (of course not even close to Trojie and Pads, but speaking of currently active members).  You don’t mention if these characters were canons that were being slashed or your own original characters. Writing good slash with strong male canon characters that have little canonical evidence to support slash, while maintaining that they are strong male canon characters, is a very tricky thing. Looking beyond any hurtful things that were said at this unspecified other site, was it over the slash’s existence, or how the characters were written to enable the story to be slash? <br><br>Are these concerns that others have expressed over Skelter, and that I have put into detail in this post, being said because we are being mean, or because speaking as more experienced writers we have concerns for this character that should be addressed before you continue with him?<br><br>I understand that it is not easy to hear and accept criticism, even criticism that is phrased politely and meant only as constructive. Please consider very carefully before replying to this, and please try not to deflect this question.]</p>

            <h1>1: I was attempting to make sure the PPC rules would accept my character as is. I.E., he wouldn&#39;t revert or anything like that. I&#39;ve answered it to my own satisfaction, the question was simply whether that &#39;answer&#39; was okay for the PPC canon.<br><br>#2: I meant canonically. I absolutely ADORE Jack as a character, he&#39;s adorkable.<br><br>#3: I was referring to what happened to him IN THE FIC. And the hilarity I was referring to was the fact that he&#39;s a ZOMBIE who thinks he&#39;s a SUPERHERO, not the awful part.<br> There are a few ways he gets around his badfic-imposed constraints, now that he&#39;s an agent. <br>First: prescription-strength Bleep-Esteem, while not a cure for ALL ills, helps him both forget most of the Unholy Urges and feel MUCH better about himself. Second: The cafeteria serves Sue for some of the more interestingly dieted agents, and Skel actually *likes* the taste of Sue. (He has a massive sweet tooth. XD) So... it&#39;s not a permanent solution, but there&#39;s no such thing, and he&#39;s fine with things the way they are.<br><br>Re: The slash and examining my characters. <br><br>Actually, they *were* original characters. <br>For the background... character A and character B had massive amounts of chemistry and balanced each other out perfectly. But, because I thought writing slash was wrong at the time, character B was paired off with character C for no good reason. Character B and Character C didn&#39;t like each other so much, there was no real chemistry and it got to the point where they were *both* borderline-abusive to each other, because they just couldn&#39;t stand each other. <br><br>By this time I had gotten over my hangups with slash, so I finally wrote B breaking up with C and A and B getting together. It happened over a period of years, their personalities didn&#39;t alter because of it (much), and B had to get over *HIS* various hang-ups on the subject... in other words, it was goodslash (I hope).   However, one of my Real Life friends started bashing Character A, SIMPLY because he was slashed with Character B, and she didn&#39;t like slash. She started saying he was badly-written and a Gary Stu, JUST because he was slashed with a character SHE liked. As in &#39;he&#39;d be a great character if he wasn&#39;t so gay because ghey is wrong.&#39; <br>Now, this friend is not a very good writer, but at the time, I thought she was okay, and her criticism kinda hurt. Especially because I was still kind of thinking writing yaoi/slash/whatever was wrong, and, well, yeah.<br><br>I know that is not what you are doing. You have legitimate concerns about my character and are trying to help me improve. I am just saying I tend to be... oversensitive because of this. I will try to improve.</h1>

            <p>First, where are you guys getting the idea that an agent being present for a canon-restoring PPCing, in their original universe or another one, will do anything to them? I can think of several reasons I&#39;ve never heard of this before: the fact that the agent&#39;s home universe tends to become the PPC once they leave their story of origin; SEP fields; a canon isolation feature of the uniform that <i>specifically prevents</i> agents from getting sucked back into their canon (not oft mentioned, but described in the Glossary of Useful Technology under &quot;Uniform&quot;); and the fact that preventing agents from working in their continuum of origin would stymie a lot of potential humor and character development; these come to mind. I&#39;m seriously puzzled by this.<br><br>Second, Plat, you said something to the effect that you think this character is a bad idea because he has traits leftover from badfic. I could name many, MANY other agents to which this applies, the top of the list being Dafydd Illian, so this also confuses the heck out of me. Overcoming those things, taking a poorly executed concept out of badfic and reworking it, is part of what makes badfic recruits interesting to read about, IMO, so since when is this automatically a terrible idea?<br><br>Also, for the record, you might have at least read this thread entirely before commenting on it—if you had, you would&#39;ve known about Jack. Telling someone what they should and shouldn&#39;t be doing without informing yourself about the context is just as poor form as issuing demands, so please cool it.<br><br>Let&#39;s all try to be rational and respectful, okay?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A few quotes from people&#39;s responses in this thread:<br><br>Phobos - &quot;Honestly, it is your character, so you should make the final decision on how much this affects them. ... That said, I can&#39;t see a canon-accurate Smoker being recruited, so I would assume they <b>didn&#39;t</b> fully revert.&quot; Emphasis added.<br><br>Myself - &quot;I don&#39;t think there are actually rules about this. In my experience, what happens to recruits once they&#39;re pulled from their badfic is highly dependent on circumstances and author preference.&quot;<br><br>PitViper - &quot;Anyhoo, the best answer to your question that I can think of is: however many rules that will make your spinoff as fun to write and funny as possible. ... Go nuts and have fun. That&#39;s they only rule we have on this kind of thing.&quot;<br><br>I think you and Plat are the only ones in this thread who have said anything about OCs automatically reverting to a canon state, whether pre-, during, or post-recruitment.<br><br>You assumed, all right, but I have to wonder if you didn&#39;t really read the thread you&#39;re basing your assumptions on. The only other possibility is that you misapprehended what you were reading. Either way, choosing not to read or actually not understanding written words, that is a pretty serious problem in this neck of the woods, and it appears to be an ongoing one. What are you going to do about it?—and again, this is not a rhetorical question. I&#39;m serious, because I want you to stop running into trouble so you can have fun. What steps are you going to take? What&#39;s the plan?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think there are actually rules about this. In my experience, what happens to recruits once they&#39;re pulled from their badfic is highly dependent on circumstances and author preference. I tend to take them exactly as they come, and then make them better. For me, that&#39;s the only reason to recruit a character: to take the concept and make something decent out of it. Otherwise, just let &#39;em assimilate into the canon or, if that&#39;s not possible, kill &#39;em.<br><br>For instance, Ilraen at the time of his recruitment was a special case in that bit characters who do pretty much nothing were generally just put out of their misery or left to assimilate, because there&#39;s supposed to be something there to work with already for them to be agent material. Pretty much all he had going for him was being an Andalite, and Twiggy and I didn&#39;t want to pass up the opportunity for an Andalite agent. But anyway, the point is that he was a blank slate in the fic, and he stayed a blank slate upon arriving in HQ. It took a lot of work on FicPsych&#39;s part to get him field-ready (this is why recruiting blank slates is <i>not</i> generally encouraged), and he&#39;s still not really a true Andalite, having missed out on being brought up as one. That&#39;s the concept I wanted to work with for him.<br><br>For Agent Derik, on the other hand, I wanted a messed-up Pernese guy fully aware of what his Sue did to him, not a Stu-faced cardboard cut-out, so I chucked him in the Reality Room to fill in a plausible backstory and provide some actual consequences for taking Thread to the face.<br><br>I don&#39;t recommend throwing your zombie in the Reality Room, for the record.<br><br>Agent Gall is a bit different: she got cut free of the badfic&#39;s narrative early on, by the badfic&#39;s own hand, so when I brought her back it was on the understanding that she turned into a canonical Viking once she was freed. True to my form, though, she still has the rudimentary personality traits and description she started with, just aged up from her last appearance in the story.<br><br>I guess the only &quot;rule&quot; I&#39;d suggest is that whatever you do, you should devote some narrative time to showing how the character gets from his state in the badfic to his state as an agent. If it isn&#39;t going to be part of the story, if it isn&#39;t going to affect him as a person, it might as well not happen at all, IMO.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Honestly, it is your character, so you should make the final decision on how much this affects them.  If you think that having them be a completely canon Smoker would be best, then go with that.  If not, go with something else.<br><br>That said, I can&#39;t see a canon-accurate Smoker being recruited, so I would assume they didn&#39;t fully revert.

            <p>Jack&#39;s bad enough and he&#39;s not even close to canon.Lucky for everyone, if he did somehow revert, the PPC&#39;s fairly, ya know... flat. No ledges to jump on and grab people... thank heavens.<br><br>The problem with Skelter is that he&#39;s from an angstfluffle of a fic, in which the Specials were slowly changing back into normal human beings. (Or, ya know, dying if they were too mutated to revert, re: the Tank.) Unfortunately, their human psyche came back before they reverted all the way, so they still had all the instincts, powers, and urges of an Infected... there was just a very human intelligence trapped inside this monster&#39;s body, having to cope with them. (In retrospect, we&#39;d been writing entirely too much Vampire: the Masquerade at the time, and I think some of that might have seeped in.)<br><br> In the fic I created for him, Skel was the fairly 2-D brother of one of the main characters, who was supposed to have ADHD and be the &#39;comic relief&#39;. In other words: a Smoker running around like Jack on acid, unable to stop. He tried to resist the badness of the fic, though- as with all characters- his attempts ended in failure.<br><br> The party got mobbed by a bunch of non!canon!psychotic!Hunters and he died, for no good reason. One of the agents took pity on him- he *did* try to resist, and she might have had an inexplicable soft spot for some of the Infected.    <br><br>So now, he&#39;s a human intelligence, stuck in a Smoker&#39;s body, thinking of the PPC as his chance to be a superhero, and still with an unholy hunger for human flesh. This is not going to end well, obviously. (Meaning: it will be hilarious.) </p>

            <p>This time with house descriptions and Big Sib names included, because I want us to have a good idea of the itty bitty numbers we&#39;re currently working with and hope more people jump on board as Big Sibs. {= P I&#39;ve tweaked some of the descriptions a little, so let me know if I&#39;ve screwed anything up.<br><br>(ALSO! If your name is Shellfur or LunarHuntress and you haven&#39;t contacted me off-Board yet, I&#39;d love it if you did, just so I know you know how. Thanks!)<br><br>Latest revision of How This Works:<br><br><b>1. PPC Goals</b><br><br>These are the primary goals of any PPCer or group of PPCers.<ol>
<li>To encourage and celebrate good writing, be it by reading and/or writing good stories, by giving concrit, by beta-reading, etc.</li>
<br><li>To have fun with bad writing, be it in the form of missions, MSTs, just talking about it, etc.</li>
<br><li>To celebrate fandom in its many forms, whether in writing, in art, in role-play, in nerdy holidays, etc.</li>
<br><li>To have fun, fulfilling, and safe community interactions with other PPCers, wheresoever you prefer to do so.</li>
<br><li>To do the above with respect for each other, for badfic authors and others, and for our community spaces, so we can all have a good time and not give anyone a justification for calling us big fat annoying stupid meanie-heads.</li>
</ol>
<br><b>2. House Goals</b><br><br>Secondary to the above PPC Goals, these are the specific aims of the system of &quot;houses&quot; for Sibs.<ol>
<li>To make it easier/less scary for newbies to approach and get to know older PPCers.</li>
<br><li>To give newbies a mentor/teacher they can always ask questions and advice.</li>
<br><li>To provide a systematic selection process for Big Sibs and Little Sibs, preventing much flailing and confusion over who should step up.</li>
<br><li>To provide a network of support for Big Sibs in particular, but all members in general, so no one person gets overwhelmed trying to mentor/advise/guide/correct/befriend/whatever all the new people, and so there are clear channels of support open for advice on given topics.</li>
<br><li>To get older PPCers more involved and more personally invested in the PPC Goals by giving them a specific obligation toward other PPCers. In other words, you&#39;re responsible for teaching your Little Sibs and correcting them if they make mistakes, so if they&#39;re consistently driving us up the wall we&#39;re going to come to you to find out why.</li>
<br><li>
<b>Not</b> to become cliques whose members never talk to anyone outside their sibs/house.</li>
<br><li>
<b>Not</b> to devalue the importance of other houses&#39; interests. For instance, just because your group isn&#39;t big on giving concrit doesn&#39;t mean people in it should believe concrit is stupid, since that would contradict the PPC Goals.</li>
</ol>
<br><b>3. House Structure</b><br><br>This is how houses work.<ol>
<li>Houses shall be made up of oldbies willing to be Big Sibs to newbies, with the responsibilities that role entails.</li>
<br><li>Each Big Sib may be in a maximum of two (2) houses, if they feel up to keeping track of two sets of fellow Big Sibs and two sets of potential Little Sibs. No more are allowed in order to prevent overzealous oldbies from overreaching themselves, and also to keep things relatively uncomplicated in line with House Goal 3.</li>
<br><li>All Big Sibs shall have a working knowledge of PPC in-universe canon and PPC rules, policies, social mores and folkways, etc., and be willing and able to teach their Little Sibs about the same.</li>
<br><li>Each house shall have a stated area of expertise that sets it apart from other houses, to provide newbies with something to identify as a particular (but not exclusive) personal interest and thus efficiently narrow the field of potential Big Sibs—House Goal 3 again. However, this area of expertise should not be too specific (i.e. <i>Lord of the Rings</i> humorfic concrit in the IRC), because that would just get really silly really fast and leave us open for too many <i>Clue</i> jokes. But seriously, basing a house on a specific fandom or PPC hangout is right out.</li>
<br><li>Each house shall have a silly name that doesn&#39;t necessarily bear any relation to its area of expertise.</li>
<br><li>Upon introducing themselves to the PPC, newbies shall be given a list of houses and their descriptions, and asked to select one (1) and only one. In order to prevent popularity/intimidation from becoming a factor, this list shall not include names of Big Sibs. Anybody should feel free to do this for newbies, so if you want to help out but don&#39;t feel up to being a Big Sib yourself, go for it!</li>
<br><li>A Big Sib from the newbie&#39;s chosen house will then elect to adopt that newbie as their Little Sib, according to availability and/or compatibility; considerations may include fandoms in common, interest in the IRC or wiki, and other matters too specific to be covered in house descriptions.</li>
<br><li>Each Big Sib may adopt as many Little Sibs as they are comfortable with.</li>
<br><li>Little Sibs may &quot;graduate&quot; without ceremony when both the Little Sib and Big Sib agree that they are functional members of the community without needing frequent help from their Big Sib. At this point, Little Sibs may become Big Sibs to the next generation of newbies if they so desire, and join any house (or two) that they feel confident about.</li>
</ol>
<br><b>4. Existing Houses</b><br><br>Listed in alphabetical order.<br><br><ul>
<li>House Darjeeling: This house is steeped in the history, lore, and traditions of the PPC. Also delicious with scones. Current Big Sibs: 3. (Neshomeh, July, hS)</li>
<br><li>House Grave Energy Initiative: This house has an emphasis on original writing, working on not just PPCing but the mechanics of fiction in general. Worldbuilding, proper description, character building and motivation, the whole nine yards. Grave Energy Initiative&#39;s ultimate goal is to produce more authors of original universes, thus ensuring that the PPC has a steady supply of authors revolving in graves for eons to come. Current Big Sibs: 1. (Tungsten Monk)</li>
<br><li>House Kind Words and a Two-by-Four: This house is big on giving constructive criticism. This house is made up of Boarders who are interested in improving their writing skills, in general, and helping other people improve as well. Current Big Sibs: 2. (Phobos, PoorCynic)</li>
<br><li>House Parmandili (Quenya <i>Book-friends</i>): This house is for those utterly obsessed with their fandom (to the point where they, say, learn the languages). Of course that doesn&#39;t mean all of us can answer every question about every canon ever—but we can help you find someone who can, and discuss how much enthusing is appropriate in the community. Current Big Sibs: 2. (hS, Elcalion)</li>
<br><li>House Skull Goblet: This house is for those who are mainly interested in the PPC&#39;s community aspect. Goals include teaching newbies how to hang out and have fun in various ways without leaving others so frustrated they want to turn the newbies&#39; skulls into goblets. Current Big Sibs: 1. (Data Junkie)</li>
</ul>
<br><br>You may observe that I didn&#39;t list a couple that were proposed, but I didn&#39;t forget them. I suggest that proposed Houses Fruitbat (VM) and Tryforce Area (Artic Blade) consider expanding their directives somewhat. Perhaps Fruitbat could cover mission-writing and the PPC spirit in general as opposed to just Rule of Funny, and Tryforce Area could handle fic-writing generally with an eye for converting concepts from various media into words, rather than just video game fic?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That sounds like a better directive for a house Nesh. I was also contemplating an emphasis on Crossovers as well, since a lot of people tend to have issues with joining those up in a cohesive way, but my brain am not thinking good with stuff right now.</p>

            <p>House Rubberglue, which is dedicated to helping the creative process, regardless of whether it is original or fanfic. For example, if you want to include a certain element in your story, you could go to this house to sorta thrash out the idea and get some other opinions. I do see this potentially clashing a little with House Kind Words and a Two-by-Four, though this house would differ in that it&#39;s involved during the process, as opposed to after, which the description for House Kind Word and a Two-By-Four seems to imply.</p>

            <p>That also overlaps more with Grave Energy Initiative, since they&#39;ve got original writing cornered. I&#39;d still encourage a fanfic-in-general direction. It, like PPC writing, has some special concerns that set it apart from other types of writing, IMO. Plus it&#39;s easier to point to something like fanfic and go &quot;Yes, I am interested in that.&quot; Being easily identifiable is a good thing when it comes to attracting members.<br><br>That said, though, it almost sounds like you&#39;re talking about beta-reading, which might work. Editing is different enough from critiquing, I think, and it&#39;s a good thing to encourage new people to learn to do well. You really have to have pretty beefy writing chops in order to be good at it, since if all you&#39;re doing is checking for SPaG, the author might as well just stick to spell-check.<br><br>I still think &quot;fanfic house&quot; is likely to be more attractive to potential newbie initiates, but that&#39;s my two cents.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Anyway, I&#39;m still a little concerned that comedy is a bit specific and yet also overlaps Grave Energy if it includes original writing and maybe Tryforce Area if it includes fanfic, whereas mission-writing definitely includes everything you said, but has other aspects, too, and isn&#39;t really covered yet, and probably should be.

            <p>Er, it all makes a great deal of sense. But the caveat is that I would be about the exact wrong person to start a humor-mission-centric house; as you may recall, the number of Actual Real Complete Total Missions I have finished is exactly zero. (Cafeteria missions are fun, but they really aren&#39;t at all what most people are looking for.)<br><br>Maybe I could broaden by talking about tone in general, instead of humor? How to achieve specific feelings with word choice and sentence structure and the like? That seems a bit general too, but it also seems a bit more useful - IIRC, the issues with some of the more serious-aiming newbies isn&#39;t so much that they want to be more serious as how they go about it. Likewise dark humor does take a more subtle touch than slapstick, and so on.<br><br>(If none of this works out, I can always join another house, too. I just think tone in writing is something that comes very naturally to some of us, and thus gets neglected as a Taught Thing, leading people to be probably be quite confused about why their permission piece didn&#39;t go over so well.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve managed to miss the bit on &quot;how to become one&quot;, but I&#39;d like to join House Parmandili as a Big Sib.

            <p>First: Are houses absolutely mandatory? If you aren&#39;t in a house, is this bad?<br><br>Second: What about the people who are neither newbie&#39;s nor oldbies? Should we sign up for a house in the same way that a newbie would I.E. create a thread saying &quot;Hey guys! I would like to join House x!&quot; Or could we do it in this thread as to not create unnecessary ones?<br><br>Third: Can we ask our Big Sibs about topics that aren&#39;t covered in our house? Or should we go to the house that specializes in that thing? For example, if I were in House Kind Words and a Two-By-Four, could I ask PC stuff about the PPC&#39;s canon?

            <p>Also: can we join a house but not be assigned a Little Sib? I&#39;m interested in joining House Parmandili but only to hang around and talk about fandoms and stuff.

            <p>No.  You cannot join a house and not be assigned a Little Sib.  The point of the houses is to pair up oldbies and newbies.  This would be the important bit of Nesh&#39;s post:<br><br>&quot;<b>3. House Structure</b><br><br>This is how houses work.<br><br>     1.

            <p>First: No, houses are not mandatory. It&#39;s just a system to help with big sib and newbie distribution so we don&#39;t have a pileup on popular people and to help with the variety of interests we might have so we can have something to narrow it down from.<br><br>That said, newbies are going to be strongly <i>encouraged</i> to have a big sib, considering how much of an issue things have been to have us come t this idea in the first place. <br><br>Second: No. You&#39;re only in a house if you&#39;re a Big Sib. Newbies get asked in their newbie thread. If you feel you still need a mentor and want one, you can ask any time, including right in this thread if you feel. <br><br>Third: Yes. You are supposed to ask your Big Sib anything and everything with regards to the PPC. If a Big Sib can&#39;t answer most questions about the PPC on their own, they shouldn&#39;t be one.<br><br>The Houses are there to provide a sort of orientation for how to pair people up, so we don&#39;t have people who have little in common shoved together. </p>

            <p>First, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back and willing to work on your behavior. That&#39;s awesome. Now, let me help you out with some advice:<br><br>Please don&#39;t go rushing headlong into trying to get permission. It will not work if you rush. For the foreseeable future, try just hanging out and joining in a conversation every now and then. We need to know we can trust you with our toys before we give you the key to the playground, so we need plenty of time to get to know you. Make sense?<br><br>We do have several tools available to help you, though. First and foremost, we&#39;ve been working on a Big Sibs/Little Sibs program, to give newbies someone they can always ask questions and bounce ideas off of and stuff. So, let us know what sort of Big Sib you&#39;d like by picking ONE of the following houses:<br><blockquote>
<b>House Darjeeling:</b> This house is steeped in the history, lore, and traditions of the PPC. Also delicious with scones.<br><br><b>House Fruitbat:</b> This house was founded particularly to teach comedy, comedic timing, Rule of Funny, etc., especially as applies to the PPC and PPC stories.<br><br><b>House Grave Energy Initiative:</b> This house has an emphasis on original writing, working on not just PPCing but the mechanics of fiction in general. Worldbuilding, proper description, character building and motivation, the whole nine yards.

            <p>This <i>is</i> the thread for discussing/choosing houses, but you are not being asked to join and write for them. Houses are not mission-teams, or writer-teams, or any such thing. The reason houses exist is to provide newbies (such as yourself) with Big Sibs, whose job it is to help guide you through the beginnings of being a PPCer-- what not to do, what to definitely do, what to read first, what behaviors are welcomed or not welcomed, how people can be contacted, how to find a beta (and how not to find a beta)... all very important things to learn, and all much easier with someone around to help you learn them.<br><br>So... technically you don&#39;t have to choose one. But considering that you seem to have a lot of trouble navigating this place without issue, I&#39;d <i>highly</i> recommend it. As in, a lot. As in, if you are serious about becoming a member of the community and writing with us and suchlike, you really really should do this. Please.</p>

            <p>There is very little that makes grammatical nitpickers (like most PPCers) twitch as much as leetspeak. Typing the full word takes approximately one second longer - maybe ten seconds, if you&#39;re a hunt-and-peck typist. Still, please take the extra seconds. It will spare many of us an early, neurotic grave.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t really fan beyond reading/watching/playing the show/book/game in question and reading the occasional fic. The closest I&#39;ve come to producing fan content was when I was part of a band that played video game music, but it fell through when our pianist got an actual gig. I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of writing fanfiction, but I honestly find it more interesting to write my own characters than to play with other people&#39;s. Long term, I hope to program a MLP game of some sort, but I&#39;m just a beginner in Java at the moment, so don&#39;t hold your breath.</p>

            <p>I have a fairly good idea of what I&#39;m doing. I have a lot of friends who are hobbyist coders, and they&#39;ve been helping me learn Java for about three months now.  This will be my first attempt at coding a substantial game from scratch- I&#39;ve made games before, but they&#39;ve all been primitive stuff like Pong or Asteroids. </p>

            <p>I consider myself pretty well-read in ACD and BBC Sherlock, but I guess it couldn&#39;t help to cross-reference indeed.

            <p>You&#39;ve got some good responses already, but I wanna clarify what &quot;speshul&quot; actually means.<br><br>The thing is, you can have any kind of character whatsoever and make it not speshul, it just depends on how you write it. Let&#39;s take the ever-popular Sue trait of beauty.<br><br>Beauty + speshulness gives you a character whose beauty causes others to instantly love them, regardless of any other circumstances that would normally lead them to react otherwise, such as the fact that she&#39;s written as a spoiled teenager, or perhaps she&#39;s just wandered into someplace she has no business being and started demanding attention. But that&#39;s okay, because her surreal loveliness means others can instantly tell she&#39;s a good person! Speshul beauty means all the men want her, all the women want to be her, and anyone who <i>doesn&#39;t</i> love her is obviously evil. Mr. Right will always fall for her eventually, and they&#39;ll live happily ever after because she&#39;s just so pretty.<br><br>Beauty - speshulness is entirely possible, though. In this case, her looks won&#39;t save her from getting into trouble if she waltzes into the Council of Elrond and insists on being sent with the Fellowship, which hasn&#39;t even been decided on yet. If she&#39;s human, all the elves are prettier than she is, and they don&#39;t care—she&#39;s in trouble, period. If she acts like a spoiled teenager, other people will treat her like a spoiled teenager. If she actually <i>is</i> a good person, she&#39;ll need to learn to act like one before people will treat her like one. If all the men want her, that might be pretty annoying or even dangerous when it turns out some of <i>them</i> are bad people, and she&#39;s going to have to contend with the fact that they only want her for superficial reasons. (Some speshul characters angst about this, too, but don&#39;t be misled—it has no impact on them as people, they won&#39;t learn anything from it, and it&#39;s only in the story in a shallow attempt force the audience to feel sympathy for them.)<br><br>Or maybe she&#39;s okay with that—maybe she&#39;s a man-eating megab*tch and loves it, and the audience is allowed to dislike her for it rather than having the narrative insist that this is right and good behavior and anyone who doesn&#39;t like it (and her) is an idiot.<br><br>In a nutshell, speshulness is all about whether the people and the environment around the character react appropriately to them, regardless of whatever traits they possess, and whether the traits are there to advance the story and make the character <i>grow</i> rather than to make the character more awesome. Speshulness means the character doesn&#39;t have to work for her achievements; they&#39;re inevitable.<br><br>So, if you&#39;re picking character traits <i>just</i> because they&#39;re cool, or they let your character do cool stuff, you&#39;re going to want to step back and re-think that. Instead, pick character traits because you want to tell a story about them—pick traits that will give your character something to overcome. Character growth makes awesome characters. Giving them cool abilities/traits to make their life easier to start with makes them boring, and yes, maybe speshul.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m not the PPC&#39;s expert on LotR either (that&#39;d be, as far as I know, Huinesoron, as the name -- Quenya for &#39;Eagleshadow&#39; -- suggests), but aside from the Istari which are heavily hinted to be Maiar, the only magic you have is some Elvish stuff (healing, mostly, but there&#39;s also that other world thing Glorfindel does at the Ford of Bruinen) and the trickery of the Enemy.<br>Also, regarding Agents: there are, as far as I&#39;m aware, two maxims:<br>1) If you think it&#39;s overpowered then it probably is;<br>and 2) context is everything.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re referring to there.<br><br>Anyway, as a bit of a Tolkien nut myself, I&#39;m pretty sure the Istari are in fact Maiar, so they have demigodly powers.<br><br>What the elves do is a little more vague—they tend to be amused when other people (such as hobbits) call it magic, and just sort of tolerate it. I don&#39;t have my book with me to find quotes right now, but I&#39;m pretty sure either Elrond or Galadriel refers to it as &quot;what you call magic&quot; at some point. It&#39;s also unclear (at least to me) whether the powers we know about (Elrond&#39;s healing, Galadriel&#39;s Mirror and mind-reading, some sort of hinted-at telepathy between them) aren&#39;t to do with their rings, or if the rings just enhance the abilities they already have, or what.<br><br>That said, it&#39;s definitely <i>not</i> the same as <i>Harry Potter</i> magic and the like, whatever the badficcers think.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s best to limit the agents to what inhabitants of the canon they&#39;re in could/would do.  The Magician agent can definitely do missions in Middle-earth.  Could s/he use a bit of magic in an empty cave in Moria, where no one would observe the spell or its effects?  Certainly!  Could s/he use a spell to assassinate a Sue if no canons are around to see?  maybe, as long as the Magician and his partner dispose of the body so no canons come across it, and the signs of being killed by an uncanonical spell.  Could the Magician use spells in the middle of the Prancing Pony in the broad light of day?  Hell, no.  (Unless it was accidental bad luck screwing over the agents, but in that case, they&#39;d better whip out the neuralyzer pretty damn fast.)<br><br>(I&#39;m assuming that by Magician you mean some kind of magic-user, and not an entertainer who performs at children&#39;s birthday parties.  Although that would be pretty fun, too.)<br><br>Plus, don&#39;t forget!  This Magician will probably be disguised as something different in Middle-earth.  So he&#39;ll have the appearance of a native helping him to stay off the radar.</p>

            <p>While that was the most stinging response out of them, it was also the most helpful. I will not write a character that has magical powers unless(and even then, possibly not) it is in a setting where the ability to use magic is common. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m not the world expert on LotR myself, but I am aware that there are magic users (Gandalf, for example) that exist in Middle-earth. If your agent is or is disguised as a canonical magic user, I don&#39;t see the problem with using one.<br><br>If you plan on using, say, a protoss High Templar that will psi storm the living daylights out of an area and hack foes to bits with psi blades well... not so much.</p>

            <p>For example, one of my agents is an elemental mage, but she really only tends to use her magical abilities in places where it&#39;s not uncanon for magic users to be or in HQ. It&#39;s personal choice, at the end, but I think as long as the agent&#39;s not a Maia or other equally uber-powerful magic user, you should be all right. <br><br>Also, you&#39;d have to think about how well the use of magic fits in with the mission you&#39;re writing. Is it necessary for magic to be used, or can they get by with using more mundane methods to gank the Sue?</p>

            <p>Back when there was the discussion thread on Aging started by Neshomeh, I had suggested starting a thread where we can all share our favourite fandoms with each other. Huinesoron suggested that the structure be as follows:<br><br>quote<br>&quot;Fandom Favourites thread - hS<br>&gt;Lord of the Rings (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;My LotR favourites - hS<br>&gt;&gt;My LotR favourites - person2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey, that sounds really interesting; tell me more - person3<br>&gt;My Little Pony (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;My MLP favourites - person2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Wow, really? Mine too! - person4<br><br>etc etc. Where you don&#39;t just say &#39;I love Boromir and Aragorn and Legolas and Galadriel and Eowyn!&#39; but actually give interesting whys as well - and then people can, as you say, browse the buffet and comment on what they want to.&quot;<br>/quote<br><br>So I just thought that it would be worth it to give this idea a go to see what comes out of it. It would generate discussion and maybe help us understand what our fellow Boarders like and why. We might even pick up a new book series/webcomic/video game/yougettheidea after asking around about it! I&#39;ll start this thread with two of my favourite fandoms, The Legend of Zelda and StarCraft, but please feel free to add many more!<br><br>PS: sorry about stealing your thunder, hS. I know you said that you wanted to start it but it&#39;s been over a month since the tread pretty much ended and I really wanted to get this started...</p>

            <p>Basically, it&#39;s a... different look at the Magical Girl genre.<br><br>Modoka Kaname is your average schoolgirl, with a fairly normal life... until a mysterious transfer student by the name of Akemi Homura arrives, and seems to know her. Shortly afterwards, she and her friend, Miki Sayaka, run across a weasel-like creature named Kyubey, who says he can grant them any wish... but in return, they have to become magical girls to fight eldritch creatures called Witches. <br><br>From there, Modoka&#39;s life will never be the same, as she and Sayaka are drawn further and further into the conflict between Magical Girls and Witches, meeting other Magical Girls as they go and surviving Witch attacks. But who is this mysterious Homura? And what are Kyubey&#39;s real goals?<br><br>...Hope I made this sound interesting, &#39;cause it&#39;s a good series... but be warned, there&#39;s a considerable amount of Nightmare Fuel involved. You have been warned.</p>

            <p>Mainly because it&#39;s a sequel done RIGHT. Transformers G1 was all kinds of awesome and it&#39;s nice to see a series that introduced NEW characters instead of just rehashing the old ones - and it had Rampage and Tarantulas, two of the most EVIL characters in the entire franchise, hands down. <br><br>And it had Waspinator. &#39;Nuff said. </p>

            <p>Part of my love for this series comes from its worldbuilding - the monetary system, strange and interesting magical animals, new sports (or, well, <i>a</i> new sport), and most of all, the experience as shown through the eyes of a boy who, despite being an iconic figure to this world, experiences it for the first time as a pre-adolescent. The setting is a fascinating place to explore.<br><br>My favourite characters are too many to list in full, but top of the list is Hermione Granger. She&#39;s an incredibly intelligent young woman - and has the ability to back it up - who clearly enjoys her studying, but sometimes at the cost of a social life. Winding up making friends with Harry and Ron, who seem to attract danger like a magnet, definitely seems to&#39;ve expanded her horizons during the adventures she has with them. By the end of the series, she&#39;s developed into a self-confident, courageous and quick-thinking young woman who will come through for her friends no matter what.<br><br>So yeah, what do you guys know or like about Harry Potter?</p>

            <p>Ah, Harry Potter. That series is so well written, with plenty of plot twists and turns to keep reader and characters alike on their toes. The descriptions also enable the reader to visualise the world beautifully and in detail. Quiddich is amazing, all the more so because I know from experience that fast-paced action sequences are NOT easy to write and J. K. Rowling manages it so very effectively.</p>

            <p>The Dresden Files was created by Jim Butcher, way back in 2000. The series is set in Chicago, narrated in first-person by Harry Dresden, a wizard and private detective.<br><br>The series covers just about every fantasy and/or magical element in the history of the known universe, and even touches on the idea of eldritch abominations--like Cthulu, but nastier. Harry&#39;s encountered them before and survived.<br><br>On the other side of the coin is the short-lived tv show, which aired on SciFy. While it lasted, it was immensely popular with those who watched it. The major divergence from the book series included Harry living in his place of business, having a lot more sex than his book counterpart, and ghost!Bob. (In the book, Bob was a spirit of Air and Intellect, and a major perv. Although ghost!Bob picked that trait up, just...not as much.)<br><br>Overall, both series are a lot of fun. For those of you in the right area, the tv show is on Hulu. The books are available just about everywhere (I know they&#39;re in Spain for sure).<br><br>I can&#39;t really say I&#39;ve got a definitive list of favorites from either series, but Butters (an ME in the book) is definitely on there.<br><br>Polka never dies!</p>

            <p>Murphy kind of reminds me of some of the PPC agents.

            <p>For those that do not know about Gundam, it is a franchise created by Yoshiyuki Tomino revolving around people fighting wars with each other in giant robots. The entire series started in 1979, with the original Mobile Suit Gundam, possibly the series that, forgive my Trope-speak, codified the entire Real Robot Genre, which means that everything tries to be as realistic as possible, discounting the psychic advanced humans and giant robots of course.<br><br>Mobile Suit Gundam, despite having to be shortened, was immensely popular, with children all wanting to buy toy models of either the titular robot, the antagonistic mook robots, or the allied mook robots. It was surprisingly a commercial success, and spawned an entire franchise based around it.<br><br>Ever since 1979, there have been many sequels, prequels, side-stories and spin-offs from the main series, with some being set in different universes. To list them all would be immensely difficult, but with the help of Tvtropes, I can get the major ones in.<br><br>The &#39;main&#39; universe of the series would probably be the Universal Century, in which the original and its sequels/prequels/side-quels all take place in. It is one of the darker universes in the Gundam franchise, which probably stems from Tomino&#39;s depression during the creation of the earlier series in this universe.<br><br>List of Major UC Series:<br>- Mobile Suit Gundam: The original, focuses on the war between the Federation and Zeon.<br>- 08th MS Team: Set during the time of the original. Very real-robot.<br>- Gundam 0080: Set near the end of the original. Follows a young boy&#39;s traumatic experience with the war.<br>- Stardust Memory: Set four years after the original. Involves the Federation fighting against the remnants of Zeon who have stolen a Gundam with nuclear weapons.<br>- Zeta Gundam: Sequel to the original, set eight years after, focusing on the conflict between the AEUG and Titans taskforce of the Federation, later pulling in Axis Zeon. Much darker than the original.<br>- ZZ Gundam: A Direct Sequel to Zeta, deals with the fallout of the the end of Zeta. Lighter than its predecessor. Highly divisive among the fandom.<br>- Char&#39;s Counterattack: A movie set six years after ZZ Gundam. Neo Zeon attempts to drop an asteroid colony on Earth. Is the end of the character arc between Amuro Ray and Char Aznable.<br>- Gundam F91: Originally supposed to be a series, got turned into a movie. Set thirty-four years after CC. The Earth Federation fights against the Crossbone Vanguard.<br>- Crossbone Gundam: A manga that bridges the time between F91 and Victory. Very popular. Involves the MS Pilot version of Chuck Norris.<br>- Victory Gundam: The Zanscare Empire tries to take over Earth. The Federation is basically a failure, requiring the League Militaire, which is basically a somewhat badly funded resistance movement, to fight off the Empire. MUCH, MUCH darker than any other series in UC.<br>- Gundam Unicorn: Most recent UC Gundam series. Set three years after CC. Involves a fight against the remnant of Neo Zeon.<br><br>G Gundam: Set during the Future Century, G Gundam is a standalone series which, unlike the others, is straight-up Super Robot. It&#39;s also a fighting series, but there are secret government conspiracies and demonic giant robots of doom as well. Includes zombies.<br><br>Gundam Wing: Set during the After Colony universe. Follows the exploits of five teenagers in Gundams sent to fight Earth for the space colonies. First series to be dubbed into English. Has a movie sequel known as Endless Waltz set a year after.<br><br>Gundam X: Set in a post-apocalyptic future. Fifteen years prior, the colonies and Earth nearly killed each other off forever. Follows the tale of some scavengers trying to protect psychic Newtypes.<br><br>∀ Gundam: Set in the Correct Century. Supposedly the far future of EVERY SINGLE GUNDAM SERIES. Follows the tale of the People of the Moon fighting against Earth&#39;s people.<br><br>Cosmic Era: This era consists of SEED, SEED Destiny, SEED Astray and Stargazer. Gundam SEED is basically the original Gundam rebooted for modern audiences. After the first part, it takes a different turn from the original. Introduced many children to the Gundam series. Its sequel, Destiny, takes place a few years later. Very controversial and disliked by many. Astray is a manga that is set at the same time as SEED. Stargazer is set around the time of Destiny, follows the adventures of members of Phantom Pain, part of the Earth Federation.<br><br>Gundam 00: Set in the far future of 2307 AD, 00 follows the tale of Celestial Being, a group that attempts to prevent war by killing everyone who starts one. With Gundams. It&#39;s very popular, and has a movie with aliens.<br><br>Gundam AGE: Newest series. Darkest series since the UC Era. Follows the 100 Years War. Not related to the English-French conflict something years back.<br><br>It is difficult to choose my favourite parts of the franchise, but I would say that the Crossbone manga was my favourite series due to the awesomeness of Tobia Arronax, the Stargazer Gundam being my favourite mecha due to it being created for peaceful purposes, and &#39;The Eternal Captain&#39; Bright Noa as my favourite character.</p>

            <p>I believe that my favorite character on Stargate Atlantis is Todd the Wraith, because he is a very complicated and interesting character. <br><br>Though he is a villain, and always, always has an agenda, he is a very open minded villain with an agenda. He is perfectly willing to work for or against any side, so long as it will benefit his goals, as opposed to a standard villain that is always opposed to the heroes.<br><br>He is incredibly good at getting himself put in charge. The first time he is seen on the show, he is dropped off on a planet full of his people, half-starved, wearing rags, with nothing to aide his standing, and in less than a year, he is in charge of a small fleet.<br><br>He has a sense of humor, a sense of honor, and great dignity. </p>

            <p>Hetalia is a manga/anime about personified countries. It acts out events in history, mostly for the laughs, but it can also be educational (if not occasionally wrong).<br><br>The countries are all overly stereotypical, for example, America is hyper and loud, and eats nothing but hamburgers... and England is grumpy, sarcastic, can&#39;t cook and sees faeries. And has huge eyebrows. (And I mean <b>HUGE</b>.)<br><br>It&#39;s quite a funny series, so I suggest you at least watch a few episodes. They&#39;re only 5 minutes each so it&#39;s quite nice. And the sub is on YouTube (rated MA for no apparent reason).<br>Oh, but don&#39;t judge it by the first episode, that one&#39;s much more fast paced than the rest.</p>

            <p>I think that one of the best things about Hetalia is that there are so many characters that it&#39;s hard not to find at least one you like. Even though some of them (like France) are somewhat shunned by the fandom they all have their redeeming qualities. Hetalia has always been my favorite canon to read fanfiction for because the series doesn&#39;t have much plot-wise, so there are endless things you could write about that don&#39;t go against canon. <br>Also, a bit of a word of warning: watching the dub for the first time can be a bit too much for some people. Along with ridiculously stereotyped accents, the narrator is a bit less informative and a bit more ... out there.</p>

            <p>I tend to stick with subs as well. I feel like a lot of the dubs don&#39;t get the voices right according to what I was imagining and with Hetalia in particular, all sense of a plot-line was substituted for crack, as well as most of the educational stuff which I prefer to cheap jokes.<br><br>As for Hetalia itself, almost all the fanfiction I read and probably all the fanfiction I will ever write will be for that continuum. This is for a number of reasons, mainly because the only canon it has is history and I hate it when a fic deviates from canon, unless it is specified as a full AU. Having history as canon also leaves a lot of things that can be explored with the characters that hasn&#39;t yet been explored in canon. Another reason is that there are tons of characters, as TheMadHatteress said, so everyone can find a character they like. <br><br>One of the topics I love to read about alternate history, for example, how the nation/characters would act if America hadn&#39;t won his freedom in 1776. This also includes speculation on future disasters and how they would affect the countries.<br><br>High School AUs are also very popular in Hetalia but are very overdone and not many are very good as they all seem to have the same plot-line after a while. Character A and Character B have crushes on each other and get together with the help of characters C and D. A and B tend to be popular canon or fanon couples like Germany and Italy or England and America. C and D are almost always Japan and Hungary if it&#39;s a slash couple (which it is 99% of the time). An author I&#39;ve found that avoids these cliches is Black.Rose.Authoress on ff.net. She keeps all the characters in character and her OC&#39;s are well balanced.<br><br>As I said before, Hetalia is filled with slash. Pick a random Hetalia fic off ff.net and it will probably include some element of slash, even if it&#39;s not a romance fic. This is a combination of having a mostly male cast and because the dub has added a ton of slash to the conversations. There&#39;s also a ton of fighting among shippers because there are only three confirmed pairings: Germany and Italy, Sweden and Finland, and Austria and Hungary. Most of the fights are between the USUK and FrUK (America&amp; England and France&amp; England respectively) and in those fics the unpaired characters are sometimes warped to show that that pairing is the right one.<br><br>And so to end my overly long rant, I salute you Hetalia fans for embracing stereotypes and digging up history books to write slash. If you haven&#39;t watched, please begin with the sub, as it is much more accurate to the original webcomic and remember that it&#39;s not supposed to be taken seriously so don&#39;t get mad if your country&#39;s made fun of, it happens to everyone&#39;s sooner or later. Arrivederci Hetalians!</p>

            <p><b>What is it? </b><br><br>Daria is an animated slice of life/dramedy series about the Morgendorffer family, and in particular the oldest daughter, Daria. Her mother, Helen, is a workaholic who neglects her family; her father, Jake, is childish, immature and unable to manage most problems without throwing tantrums, and her sister, Quinn, is a superficial fashion and popularity-obsessed teenager. Daria, in contrast, is intelligent, cynical and unpopular. This state changes slightly when the family moves to Lawndale- Daria meets her (probably) first real friend, the just-as-cynical artist Jane Lane, and the two of them spend the series mainly dealing with high school and getting thrown into situations they don&#39;t like and dealing with them in their own rebellious style.<br><br><b>Why do I like it?</b><br><br>I grew up watching two taped episodes of Daria (&#39;Write Where It Hurts&#39; and &#39;Depth Takes A Holiday&#39;, in case you were wondering) and whatever I could randomly catch on TV. I loved it, but it wasn&#39;t until I got the DVD series that my love for the series really cemented. Daria appealed to me in a way no other character had before- like me, Daria was cynical, unpopular, and constantly frustrated at the world around her. The show never failed to mock the popular kids and show how shallow and unlikeable they were. The episodes were hilarious, the jokes never failed to amuse, and I could always relate to Daria and Jane. The show also progressed quite well- the second movie, which was the end of the series, focused on the characters&#39; attempts to get into college, and there were a couple of quite significant changes character-wise.<br><br><b>Favourite things</b><br><br>Favourite episode: Probably either &#39;Arts &#39;N&#39; Crass&#39; or &#39;Write Where It Hurts&#39;. The former has some brilliant scenes of rebellion, and the latter has some really touching and thoughtful insights into Daria&#39;s character.<br><br>Favourite character: Either Daria or Jane. Daria&#39;s smart, cynical, principled and stands by her principles. She&#39;s not afraid to stand up against something that&#39;s wrong and she&#39;ll help out those who she thinks need the assistance. Jane matches Daria&#39;s cynicism, but she has a definite personality and goes outside being &#39;Daria&#39;s best friend&#39;. <br><br>Favourite character to hate: Quinn. Mainly because she closely resembles some RL people I never liked. That, and she&#39;s one of the most superficial and unlikeable characters I&#39;ve ever watched.<br><br>In short: I utterly adore this show.</p>

            <p>My overall favorite thing about <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and Tolkien in general is that he writes beautifully. Yeah, he goes on a bit sometimes, but when a master linguist wants to talk, I don&#39;t mind listening. I admit I struggled when I was younger and didn&#39;t really understand these things, but my appreciation for his writing has only deepened as I&#39;ve grown. I fell in love all over again when I learned in college that alliterative verse was a thing and finally understood what was going on with the Rohirric songs. <i>Genius.</i><br><br>Y&#39;know what, let&#39;s start with:<br><br><b>Favorite Song</b><br><br>... Actually not one of the Rohirric ones. Sorry! My favorite is actually the one that Sam sings in Minas Morgul when he&#39;s got the Ring and the orcs are convinced he&#39;s a big scary elf warrior, but they&#39;ve all panicked and basically killed each other off, and now he&#39;s lost, and he&#39;s trying to find and rescue Frodo, and the only way to do that is to keep making noise because the last guard standing thinks Sam is Frodo (because who else could it be, everyone else is dead or fled), and will lead the way:<br><br>In western lands beneath the Sun<br>   the flowers may rise in Spring,<br>the trees may bud, the waters run,<br>  the merry finches sing.<br>Or there maybe &#39;tis cloudless night<br>  and swaying beeches bear<br>the Elven-stars as jewels white<br>  amid their branching hair.<br><br>Though here at journey&#39;s end I lie<br>  in darkness buried deep,<br>beyond all towers strong and high,<br>  beyond all mountains steep,<br>above all shadows rides the Sun<br>  and Stars forever dwell:<br>I will not say the Day is done,<br>  nor bid the Stars farewell.<br><br>Truthfully some of this probably comes from the tune used in the BBC radio play version, but it&#39;s just so sweet and so hopeful, this simple little song standing up to one of the darkest, scariest places in the world and fact that the most important person in the world is in serious danger of his life... It brings tears to my eyes, and I&#39;m not just saying that.<br><br>Pretty much everything Rohirric is a close second, though. For instance:<br><br>Out of dark, out of doubt, to the day&#39;s rising<br>I came, singing in the sun, sword unsheathing<br>To hope&#39;s end I rode, and to heart&#39;s breaking<br>Now for wrath! Now for ruin! And a red nightfall...<br><br>Stirring! (See the alliteration, guys? See how it tells you where the emphasis goes? Isn&#39;t it cool? {= D )<br><br><b>Favorite Character</b><br><br>Y&#39;know, it changes, because it&#39;s pretty much a three-way tie between Aragorn, Sam, and Faramir. Two of things that most pissed me off about the Peter Jackson movies were things that screwed around with the latter two for no good reason, and Aragorn&#39;s treatment was pretty annoying at times, too. He didn&#39;t <i>need</i> angst, thanks very much, he already had enough on his plate to be going on with—but no. Gotta have self-doubt and angst, &#39;cause we have to get the lowest common teenage denominator to relate. -_-*<br><br>Okay, so maybe Aragorn is my favorite character. To be fair, there is a kernel of self-doubting and concern about his worthiness there, but part of the reason I like him so much is that he&#39;s capable of putting that aside to do what needs to be done, because it <i>needs to be done</i> and he&#39;s the only person around who can do it. This is a man who has the strength of character to love a woman for <i>decades</i> without being able to be with her, and to go on fighting the good fight because not only is it right, not only is he really the only man for the job, but also it is the only way he will ever have any hope of being with Arwen. And then he <i>still has to be King</i>.<br><br>And what&#39;s more, he never bitches about it, unlike some characters from other series I could name who are stuck in positions of life-or-death, world-shaking importance. I think he mentions like once to the hobbits that his is a pretty lonely life, and then it&#39;s back to business. Aragorn is a guy who&#39;s old enough to know that moaning and complaining doesn&#39;t improve things, so he doesn&#39;t waste his energy on it. He focuses on getting the job done. And he&#39;s good at his job.<br><br>Oh, and did I mention patience? Compassion? Fairness? Hands that wield both life and death?<br><br>I wanted to be Aragorn&#39;s sidekick as a kid. I still wouldn&#39;t mind. I could toughen up, I swear. I&#39;d work really hard. Just teach me, please.<br><br><b>Favorite Scene</b><br><br>I think I agree with hS here: when the Rohirrim turn up at the very last minute to break the siege of Minas Tirith, it&#39;s just one of the greatest things ever (see above totally cool alliterative verse—a lot of it happens in this scene). The arrival of the ships a bit later is slightly diminished because they&#39;re following such a great act—although by then things are even more desperate, because <i>oh god how are they still losing after all the badassery we just witnessed!?</i> So that&#39;s a pretty amazing moment, too.<br><br><b>Favorite Person to Hate</b><br><br>The Mouth of Sauron. Man, I hate that guy. He shows up all of maybe twice, if that, but he&#39;s just such an arrogant, lying scumbucket. He is a lying liar who lies, and it&#39;s a good thing he&#39;s got so much mouth, so there&#39;s more to punch. Jerk.<br><br>But, to end on a good note:<br><br><b>Favorite Location</b><br><br>Middle-earth is full of really cool settings, some beautiful, some awe-inspiring, some just plain scary, and I want to see all of them (well, maybe not the really scary ones), but I think I&#39;d start with the Great River, because I love rivers and water in general. I wanna visit the Falls of Rauros, and the Rapids of Sarn Gebir, and go see the Argonath, and climb up Amon Lhaw and Amon Hen and maybe even Tol Brandir if it looked like I could get away with it without falling off and dying. The view from any of those places would be intense. Maybe I&#39;d pick my next destination from there.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(I didn&#39;t need my thunder anyway. No problems ;))<br><br><b>What is Middle-earth?</b><br><br>In short, the Saga of the Jewels and the Rings - roughly seven thousand years of fully integrated and cohesive mythology, plus an unknown length of time before that going back to The Beginning. It&#39;s not just a story - it&#39;s a world, where most of the stories and poems are written by people within the stories (hence LotR is almost entirely written from a Hobbitty PoV - and where it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s from a people-telling-things-to-Hobbits PoV) - it&#39;s a huge toy, really, with some awesome stories about real(istic) people.<br><br><b>Why do I like it?</b><br><br>Basically that. :P Partly because there&#39;s just <i>so much there</i> - if you&#39;ve read LotR, The Hobbit and Silm, there&#39;s still Unfinished Tales and Children of Hurin to go - and after that there&#39;s 12 volumes of the Histories, and then Letters (which contains some things not otherwise mentioned), and The Road Goes Ever On (Tolkien-approved tunes for the songs!), and the Atlas, and just <i>everything</i>.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the unofficial things like <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a>, where you can find out everything about an aspect of the world (in this case, the languages - did I mention he made fully-working languages?), and it&#39;s just <i>fun</i>. <i>And</i> the story and writing style are captivating - the arrival of the Rohirrim at Minas Tirith is still my favourite piece of writing ever.<br><br>Oh, and I think there were a couple of films at some point.<br><br><b>My Favourites</b><br><br>(Since this was where I was originally going with the idea...)<br><br><i>Favourite Character?</i><br><br>Finrod Felagund, hands down. The Elvenking of Nargothrond who ruled over half of Beleriand (back in the First Age, the Elder Days some 7000 years before the War of the Ring) and (which is more) made the other half get along with each other by sheer force of personality - but still found time to debate the nature of mortality with a human woman and expound his vision of What Happens After. One of the few Kings of the Eldar to actually <i>listen</i> to the Valar (he was guided by Ulmo to set up one of the longest-lasting Elven strongholds, which only fell because of Turin - but more on <i>him</i> later), who was named <i>Wisdom</i> by the mortals (not to mention his mother)... and who gave up everything, realm, friends, freedom and ultimately his life, to help the mortal Beren achieve the Quest of the Silmaril. Awesome fellow.<br><br><i>Favourite Character You&#39;ve Heard Of?</i><br><br>Well that&#39;s far more difficult. Probably Galadriel - who incidentally is Finrod&#39;s younger sister, and a lot like him. Ludicrously powerful, but able and willing to step into the background and <i>not</i> overshadow Celeborn (except in the films) - this despite the fact that she was one of the most enthusiastic about the whole &#39;Go to Middle-earth and get stuff to rule&#39; thing. She&#39;s the one who resisted Feanor, Sauron and the Ring - and the summons of the Valar to go home, for more than six thousand years.<br><br><i>Favourite Scene?</i><br><br>I said this already: the coming of the Rohirrim to Minas Tirith in RotK. <a href="http://pastebin.com/RSnyiRqr">This scene</a>. It has a fantastic emotional flow - and the actual writing is amazing.<br><br><i>Favourite Person To Hate?</i><br><br>Turin. Oh dear Valar I dislike that man. How does one man manage to cause the destruction of <i>two</i> ancient realms (and then his dad made the first chink in the armour of the third)? And, y&#39;know, how does he manage to be <i>such an idiot</i> about it? Hint: if they&#39;re bringing a message from the only Vala who wants anything to do with you (Ulmo), your response should not be &#39;But I like my bridge too much to tear it down&#39;.<br><br>The release of <i>The Children of Hurin</i> is a cause of both disappointment and hope.

On the other hand, if Christopher can cobble together <i>one</i> novel from the Silm legends, who&#39;s to say he won&#39;t pull out the Lay of Leithian or Fall of Gondolin some day? Well, as I say, I live in hope.<br><br>(I think I&#39;ll stop here)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>LunarHuntress: Describe Homestuck.<br><br>Homestuck is a webcomic that broke down conventional storytelling, tossed it in the cosmic trash can, and came up with something totally new.  Even the medium it&#39;s told in is a never-before-seen mix of art, writing, animation, interactive game, meta-puzzle, and a sort of audience participation.<br><br>Though as a story and a fandom has only been in existence for three years, has grown to encompass nearly everything I like in a story.  Honestly, it&#39;s become one of my absolute favorite stories.  It has all the science-fantasy staples - aliens, AIs, apocalypses, reality-altering computer games, multiple universes, time travel, robots, ghosts, psychic powers, magic, wizards, dream shenanigans, vampires, Cthulhu-esque eldritch abominations - but under its surface of silliness and nearly insane complexity are actually deep themes of love, loyalty, and growing up.  It&#39;s a coming-of-age story, a saving-the-world story, a survival story.  Its plot is incredibly intricate and convoluted - what began as a story about four friends playing a computer game for the fate of the world has become so, so much more - but everything is coming together and nothing is done without a reason.<br><br>I especially love characters in Homestuck.  Every one of them, even the side characters, are complex and relateable and feel so real.  Everyone has problems to overcome; everyone has moments that make you love them, and moments that make you hate them, and even the characters that inflict the worst damage on the others you can&#39;t help but feel compassion for.<br><br>It&#39;s at times heartwarming, heart-wrenching, terrifying, awe-inspiring, stupidly silly, and <i>wickedly</i> funny.<br><br>I can honestly say that I have never seen anything remotely like it before.<br><br><br>It&#39;s also very, very long, and still ongoing.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see why everyone loves it so much. My friends keep telling me to skip the first three acts but that goes against my strict code of always reading everything in order without skipping so I really can&#39;t. So far I&#39;ve found the characters somewhat dull, the art not up to snuff, and RPG stuff randomly thrown in irritating. The only incentive I have to keep reading is that my friends rave about it, so tell me what is it that makes it so much better than everything else I&#39;ve ever read that has aliens and AI and apocalypses?</p>

            <p>I liked them a lot.  They were cute and funny and happy... but maybe that&#39;s just me.  However, you&#39;re doing the right thing - under no circumstances skip <i>anything</i> in Homestuck (not even the intermission), because <i>everything</i> will come back as an important plot point later on.  Acts 1 and 2 introduce you to the characters and their relationships and explain basic things that you really need to know for later, like kernelsprites and capchaloguing and alchemization and, well, the entire point of Sburb.<br><br>And though the beginning is sort of slow, it does pick up very quickly around Act 3, and by Acts 4 and 5 it is an epic of mind-blowing proportions.  Homestuck now is nothing like how it was in the beginning.</p>

            <p><b>What is it? (to me)</b><br><br>It&#39;s a tale of good and evil, darkness and light. It&#39;s a tale of fantastical elemental powers being used to stave off the menace of an everpresent evil that is cunning, and smart, and wins sometimes, and above all he&#39;s unrelentingly nasty under all his smooth talk so you can hate him without remorse. It&#39;s people being strong, and people failing, and epic awesome mask powers and stupid jokes and hilarious insults and <i>really good animation</i> wait that&#39;s just the first three years I haven&#39;t even gotten into everything post Mask of Light!<br><br><b>Why do I like it?</b><br><br>It&#39;s my childhood, pretty much, so I love it for all the things it was when I was eight. The Toa Mata/Nuva&#39;s fights against the infected Rahi in 2001 and the original Mata Nui Online Game that took Takua to the six villages in a first person view that hid his identity until he found it out himself and watched the Toa confront <i>the</i> Makuta, not to mention the multiple awesome minigames. 2002 and the Bohrok, with the reports written &#39;by Takua&#39; on the various attacks, the Bohrok animations that showed the story to someone playing catch-up, and the transformation of the Toa into their Nuva forms. 2003 and the Bohrok-Kal with more animations, then Naming Day when I found this glorious thing, and then the second MNOG that followed Hahli across the island as she trained for Kohlii, and then the unrelentingly evil Sons of Makuta also known as Rahkshi appeared and the Toa of Light was prophesied and the Herald went to find him and Takua was transformed into a Toa and then came the discovery of Metru Nui!<br><br>Ahem. I like 2004 on too, especially 2004 when it revealed that any Matoran could become a Toa with the application of Toa stone to Suva since this opened up a whole world of canonical fanficcy opportunities, but 2001-2003 will forever have a special place in my heart. Whichever year had the reveal that Lightning was an element and the Matoran with it were female was pretty awesome too.<br><br><b>Specific favorites</b><br><br><i>Favorite character</i><br>The Makuta Teridax, for all his slimy world-dominatey viciousness, is a pretty awesome character, but I&#39;d have to say my absolute favorite is... drumroll please while I try to pick <i>just one</i> ... drumroll...<br><br>Ma! Ta! Nu! <i>Eeeeeeee</i>!<br><br>Ahem. <br><br>Mata Nui! The guy who&#39;s got an island named after him, the guy who&#39;s got a religion based around worshipping him, the guy who was a giant robot with people in, the guy who was voiced by Michael Dorn, the guy who was snoozing until the last story arc... is probably my favorite character of them all. He&#39;s compassionate and noble and a bit stilted in the &#39;figuring out how to be short where short means not 40 million feet tall and detached from people&#39; way but he figures it out, and one of the first things he does in a new Toa-sized body is <i>not</i> step on a Scarabax beetle. Who then goes on to be his travelling companion and occasionally literal shield, so there you go.<br><br>Mata Nui also made probably one of the more romantic gestures of first promising to take Kiina to a new planet and then taking the new planet to her. Okay so 1, it was his job anyway and even if he hadn&#39;t promised that to Kiina he would have reformed Spherus Magna and used the Mask of Life&#39;s power to give it new life anyway, and 2, I have my shipping goggles on so tight they&#39;re cutting off circulation, <i>but that scene was what tightened them in the first place so blah.</i> It&#39;s not even impossible as canon so long as it&#39;s only a one-way thing Kiina has and Mata Nui only reciprocates close friendship!<br><br>Honorable mentions go to Kopaka, my first crush on a fictional character and setting of one of my types to frosty and silent but also protective and very duty-bound, to Matoro, whose death was the first time I cried about something in Bionicle without it being tears of laughter, to Click and Pewku, for being the best non-humanoid and non-speaking characters I know of, and finally to <i>the</i> Makuta Teridax for being an unrelentingly excellent villain.<br><br><i>Favorite part of favorite era</i><br><br>My squeeing up above probably made it obvious I really like the 2001-2003 era, but my favorite part has got to be the Bohrok(-Kal) Animations made by Templar Studios, and the MNOGs made by same. Watching the characters, and being the characters, was the. Freaking. Best. Is the best, since I can relive them any time I want due to having the games on my hard drive and the flash animations on the BIOsector01 wiki. I think my favorite of those is MNOG1 and the Animations, since while MNOG2 was fun once I finally got to play it all the way through without glitches it&#39;ll always be tainted with the memory of it being taken off the Bionicle site in early 2004 and then being returned in 2006 with glitches galore. Also, training the six stats needed for Kohlii is a giant boring grind that I couldn&#39;t stand enough to not go into the text-save document the version of the MNOG2 I had and boost all the stats to 99, so sailing through the Kohlii matches was a bit boring. And the ending was a letdown after <i>nearly eight years</i> of waiting.</p>

            <p>BIONICLE. A brilliant line of toys that helped keep LEGO alive during the early 21st century. With its build-able action figures and fun story, the series probably captured the hearts of many young children, and some of them may still be engrossed in it, no matter the fact that the toyline was cancelled in 2010.<br><br>Yet despite my love for the toys themselves, my interest was more in the beautifully crafted story. For something that was made to sell toys, the story was magnificent in my eyes. From the original six Toa fighting against the Rahi and the dark Makuta in order to wake the Great Spirit, Mata Nui, to the final battle between two giant robots on a desert planet, it kept most of its charm, no matter how rushed the ending was.<br><br>Although some may have disliked the transition from a tribal fantasy feel to the science-fantasy of the later years, I found the action and adventure still incredibly interesting, along with the greater emotional depth later years gave to the characters.<br><br>In all, it was an epic tale of good triumphing over evil, no matter how long it would take, and to craft a better future for everyone.<br><br>The writers have no sense of scale though.<br><br>(Seriously LEGO? Mata Nui being a 40 million feet tall robot? And able to land on Bara Magna?)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m one of the people who disliked the fantasy elements being shooed out, buuut that&#39;s what fanfic is for. Prophetic constellations that are actually real stars kind of stop being allowed to make sense when everything else is all sci-fi and ~techy~? Nixie<s>&#39;s a cross-wired freak who has weird dreams</s> sees visions when she looks up at the stars, so she&#39;s the only one who can &#39;decipher&#39; them because she&#39;s the only one who <i>can get meaning</i> from them, so that&#39;s why she&#39;s the Astrologer when in Metru Nui deciphering the prophesies was the job of the Ko-Matoran. Also, otherwise dragging the wizards back in.<br><br>40 million foot tall robots, though? No, GregF, I&#39;m sorry, I know too much about logic and physics and <i>sense</i> to let that number slide. I&#39;ll be over there with a calculator, a mechanical pencil, and about half a ream of paper, trying to make this thing reasonable. I&#39;ll probably use the other half-ream on making what&#39;s <i>inside</i> the robot be reasonable, including that whole &#39;glitchy AI&#39; <i>thing</i>...</p>

            <p>(sorry about the double post- I intended to return to the forum and familiarize myself with the format, but I accidentally posted my message.)<br><br>What is it?<br><br>A series of fantasy novels written by Terry Pratchett. The books take place on the fictional Disc, a flat planet carried on the backs of four elephants which in turn are supported by a massive turtle.<br><br>Why do I like it?<br><br>Ooh, where to start? First off, it&#39;s funny. Discworld is governed by different rules than our reality, and the Laws of Narrative Comedy reigns supreme in practically everything. The events and forces in the Discworld books all feel genuine while being completely absurd, as if Discworld was what our universe might have amounted to had it been created by someone with a sense of humor, like what reality OUGHT to be. Although I&#39;ve read the phrase in hundreds of glowing book reviews, Discworld is one the few series I would EVER refer to as &quot;uproariously funny.&quot; <br><br>Secondly, every character (and there are a great many of them) is a pleasure to read about. Pratchett has a talent for writing compelling personas that are easy to invest yourself in. Very few of his characters feel forced archetypes, and almost every one has some quirk that serves to differentiate them from the typical type-cast roles of fiction. Dukes who grow up as hard-knock cops and two-bit con men put in charge of government agencies are relatively normal compared to some of the outlandish characters featured in the books.<br><br>Finally, Pratchett is not afraid to tackle difficult themes and real-world controversies with his series. Snuff, the latest Discworld book, explores the history of slavery. Although the names and the dates may be different and the slaves may be goblins, it is impossible to read Snuff without being reminded of the atrocities that took place in the real world. Incredibly, Snuff remains funny while dealing with such dark subject matter, switching seamlessly between somber allegory and absurd comedy.<br><br>You can really start the Discworld series anywhere. Although they do have a chronological order, the books are not heavily dependent on one another. However, the series does cover several different sets of characters, and I would recommend starting with a Night Watch book.</p>

            <p>Somewhere deep in space, in an entirely different universe, a disc of land is borne through space by the Great A&#39;Tuin, the space turtle. On its shell stands four massive elephants, who carry the Discworld on their backs. A sun and a moon orbit the entire system as the elephants move round and round like the hands of a clock, giving the Disc a spin. <br><br>Now on the Discworld itself, there are many different story arcs you can follow. You can visit Ankh-Morpork, the oldest and grubbiest of cities (cut in half by the River Ankh which is so polluted one does not drown in it; one suffocates to death) and follow the City Watch as they crack down on crime in the city. The wizards at the Unseen Univesity also have their own stories, as well as arch-swindler Moist von Lipwig. <br><br>Rincewind the cowardly wizzard (yes, it is spelled that way)  also has his own (unwanted) adventures, accompanied by a homicidal trunk known as the Luggage. Made of sapient pearwood, it is completely loyal to its master and will not hesitate to violently attack all those which it perceives as a threat to its owner.<br><br>If there are wizards, there must be witches too. They don&#39;t use magic in the same way as wizards do, instead choosing to rely on common sense to get things done. I haven&#39;t read their stories yet, but they feature Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg as well as Tiffany Aching.  <br><br>If you&#39;re considering picking up Discworld, I&#39;d like to suggest <i>Guards! Guards!</i> as a starting point. It is the first novel in the Watch series and gives a good introduction to the Disc. I&#39;d follow it up with <i>The Colour of Magic</i> and <i>The Light Fantastic</i>, the two first Rincewind novels.</p>

            <p>Because I can&#39;t pass up a chance to plug it.<br><br>It&#39;s a sci-fi TV series, and it is vastly under-appreciated. I&#39;m not complaining that the drooling fanbrats mostly haven&#39;t heard of it, mind you, but still.<br><br>Basically, it&#39;s about an astronaut, John Crichton, who gets sucked down a wormhole in the process of a test flight and ends up... somewhere else... right in the middle of a space battle. He gets hauled on board the fleeing living ship, Moya, just before she and her crew of escaped prisoners Starburst the heck away from their captors, the Peacekeepers. John&#39;s now stuck with these people, and he has to try to work out a way to get back to Earth while keeping away from the Peacekeepers and trying to cope with culture shock, conflicts of interests, other people besides the PKs trying to screw the crew over, various members of the crew trying to screw each other over, etc. It&#39;s so much fun, you guys.<br><br>I love <i>Farscape</i> because it&#39;s so quirky, yet so deep; so silly, yet so intelligent. It&#39;s not afraid to have fun, and it&#39;s equally not afraid to stab you right in the heart and <i>twist</i> every so often. It can be a little cheesy, especially in earlier episodes, but it has incredible heart.<br><br>It&#39;s got an amazing cast of characters. I have my favorites, of course, but there are very few I can truly say I don&#39;t like. Even some of the ones I raised my eyebrow at the first time around grew on me in subsequent viewings of the series. They&#39;ve <i>all</i> grown on me, in fact: the ones I loved to begin with, I just love even more. The bad guys are as awesome as the good guys. Everybody gets a character arc here.<br><br>It has absolutely fantastic settings and creatures. I mean, the Henson Creature Shop did all the non-humanoid aliens. Of course they&#39;re fantastic. Two of the main cast are extremely complex, wonderful puppets, only one of which is even bipedal. You&#39;d never mistake them for humans with makeup, and yet the puppeteering and voice acting, not to mention the acting of their co-stars, are so good that they come across just as alive and real as the humanoids.<br><br>I can&#39;t recommend this series enough. It&#39;s one of the best sci-fi shows out there. Unfortunately, it suffered the same fate as <i>Firefly</i> and got cancelled unexpectedly after its fourth season. (We were promised five. Jerks.) The fans banded together and protested like mad, and we got a miniseries out of it to tie things up. It does a pretty good job, too, so you won&#39;t be left hanging.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Or, &quot;In which Neshomeh overuses the word &#39;awesome&#39; and depletes her quota for the rest of the month.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Favorite Character&quot; is a bit complicated, so I&#39;m going to have to break it up.<br><br><b>First Favorite Character</b><br><br>The character I first fell in love with is Pilot. That&#39;s not his actual name—it&#39;s never explicitly stated that he has a name—but since it would probably be a gazillion syllables long if he does have one, he&#39;s called Pilot. He is, in fact, Moya&#39;s pilot, but he&#39;s a lot more than that. Leviathans and Pilots share a symbiotic relationship, so he&#39;s also her companion and translator, and he&#39;s the one who makes sure all the life-support systems (which Moya does not need to live) keep working in addition to regulating everything else. He&#39;s a pretty important dude.<br><br>Unfortunately, he&#39;s also pretty much the last guy who should have his job. He&#39;s young (for his species—creatively also referred to as Pilots), has very little experience, and boy oh boy, the baggage. Everybody on <i>Farscape</i> has baggage, but his is pretty epic. I can&#39;t say any more, because that would be spoiling.<br><br>Generally speaking, Pilot is mild-mannered (save the occasional snippy remark) and works hard to do well by Moya and the crew, but there&#39;s only so much one person can take, and when he gets fed up you&#39;d better watch out. It&#39;s not a good idea to piss off the guy who controls the ship. The rare moments when Pilot totally flips his lid are some of the most dramatic due to how bad it has to get for that to happen, and how much <i>worse</i> he can make it when he has a mind to.<br><br>So, there&#39;s all that personality and character arc stuff—though he doesn&#39;t get nearly enough screen time, IMO. What there is is awesome, but... ah, never mind. <br><br>Also, he&#39;s one of the Henson creatures I mentioned, so he&#39;s just amazing to look at. He&#39;s about as far from humanoid as you can get. He&#39;s got a head with two eyes and a mouth, but the similarities end there. I can&#39;t describe him adequately, so <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Farscape+Pilot&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=hj8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WLH7T4rYMYbCrQGSscSLCQ&amp;ved=0CEQQsAQ&amp;biw=1278&amp;bih=679">have some pictures!</a><br><br>Even those only help so much. Most of them don&#39;t really show that he&#39;s got four arms. They also don&#39;t show that he&#39;s huge: his body stretches way down, and ends in tendrils that are biologically bonded to Moya and run pretty far throughout. In real-life context, a puppeteer fits inside his upper body to do large turning movements and such; there are at least five guys who operate him. He&#39;s just really, really cool all around.<br><br><b>Second Favorite Character</b><br><br>Not second-place, just... second. The one who&#39;s grown on me most over the years, basically: Ka D&#39;Argo, the Luxan warrior. His growth over the course of the show is really, really beautiful. He fills out the obligatory tough guy archetype, and he does it well, he&#39;s very macho and all that. He&#39;s also a simple guy with simple dreams, and you can&#39;t help but sympathize with him as you start to see all the crap goes through for them. D&#39;Argo carries important themes of prejudice and racism on his big, muscly shoulders. These themes abound, considering that the Peacekeepers have a thing about not mixing with other species, but I&#39;d say D&#39;Argo&#39;s the one whose arc most highlights them.<br><br>He is also hilarious. He is the best at trying and failing to understand John&#39;s human idioms, and his own humor is surprising and awesome. It&#39;s a bit black, and a bit sarcastic, and a bit self-aware. It&#39;s one reason I started paying more attention to him.<br><br><b>Also, Scorpius.</b><br><br>Scorpius. Phobos already talked about Scorpius, but let me just take a moment to heartily second him. Scorpius is freaking awesome in every possible way and he gets my number one spot. (That Malfoy kid is gonna have to work damn hard to even scratch worthiness to share the name.)<br><br><br>... I am noticing that my top three are all dudes, so let me just add that the female characters all kick ass, too. Not one lady on this show is weak in any sense whatsoever. Oddly enough, my least favorite is the healery one—her writing is not quite as strong as the others&#39;, I think—but she still kicks ass. You don&#39;t want to mess with Zhaan.<br><br><b>Favorite female character</b> is the lead, Aeryn, though. This might have to do with the fact that she has a great relationship with Pilot (that, like him, does not get enough screen time). And Chiana is v. v. fun, as Phobos said.<br><br>... I could tell you why almost every single <i>Farscape</i> character is awesome, but I have to wrap this up because it&#39;s past my bedtime.<br><br><b>Favorite Episode</b><br><br>Oh god... uh... well, the second season&#39;s ninth episode, &quot;Out of Their Minds,&quot; has a special place in my heart because it&#39;s the first one I ever saw, and it hooked me. It&#39;s a body-swapping episode, so I had no idea who these people were or what was going on except I think a friend had told me about the show once months previously, but really no clue. And it was awesome. <i>Farscape</i> boldly goes where other shows fear to tread, so my first exposure to the show and the characters involved working out how to pee (and properly stow the equipment afterward), a man&#39;s shameless and juvenile response finding himself in a body with boobs, and why it&#39;s a bad idea to swap an extremely complex, multitasking-capable mind into a relatively limited biped brain, and vice versa.<br><br>(Also red acid vomit that can creep <i>upward</i>, but that&#39;s unrelated.)<br><br>&quot;Crackers Don&#39;t Matter&quot; is a fantastic cracked-out episode. Another great cracked-out ep is &quot;Revenging Angel,&quot; though (season 3, ep 16). It&#39;s the result of the show&#39;s producers sitting around and discussing why doing an animated episode would never work, and then deciding to go ahead and do it anyway. And frell me if it doesn&#39;t work.<br><br>Season 1&#39;s &quot;DNA Mad Scientist&quot; is pretty high up, too. It&#39;s one of the darker, more serious ones, wherein some pretty horrific stuff goes on. It&#39;s about Pilot and Aeryn and how the crew can be utter bastards to each other when a chance to serve themselves comes along. This decreases as they spend more time stuck together and dependent on each other, but in the first season they&#39;re almost as dangerous to themselves as the actual bad guys.<br><br><br>I totally failed at wrapping this up. Oh well.<br><br>~Neshomeh, gonna go pass out now.</p>

            <p><b>Favorite Character</b><br><br>This is a tough one.  There are so many great characters in this show.  But I think I have to give it to Chiana.  She is energetic, vibrant (despite being grey), overtly sexual, and always looking out for her self first.  She has a unique way of talking and moving that physically sets her apart from other characters.  She, like the rest of Moya&#39;s crew, is an escaped criminal, and is not quick to trust anyone.  Once she does trust you, you have a friend and ally for life...or at least until the next crisis, in which case it&#39;s every sentient being for itself.<br><br>In the end, Chiana really is a good person.  It&#39;s just buried under all of her survival instincts, distrust, and fear.<br><br><b>Favorite Episode</b><br><br>I&#39;ve got to go with Crackers Don&#39;t Matter (season 2).  It is one of the episodes that you should not, under any circumstances, play for someone who doesn&#39;t know anything about the series, yet.  It is 10 pounds of crack in a 5 pound bag.  It is so much fun, though.  <br><br>Basic synopsis is, the crew stops for supplies (crates full of crackers) and finds an alien who can upgrade their ship to make them harder for Peacekeepers to find.  The only problem is that they have to go through a cluster of pulsars to get to his shipyard, and the pulsars give off a radiation that has a tendency to affect lesser life-forms in interesting ways.  Shouldn&#39;t be a problem for the highly developed crew of Moya, though, right?<br><br>Honorable mention goes to two other cracked out episodes: John Quixote (season 4) and Won&#39;t Get Fooled Again (season 2).<br><br><b>Favorite Villain</b><br><br>Scorpius.  Hands down, there is not a better bad guy in just about anything.  He is the kind of guy that is so creepy, so ruthless, and so cunning that you can&#39;t help but be in awe of him.  His level of badass knows no bounds.<br><br>Scorpius is a Scarran/Sebacean half-breed.  Due to the Scarran race&#39;s tendency to radiate extreme heat, and the Sebacean race&#39;s intolerance for heat, Scorpius has to wear a thermal control suit so his own body doesn&#39;t kill him.  He also has a cooling rod inserted directly into his brain.<br><br><b>Favorite Character to Hate</b><br><br>There is no lack of characters worthy of dislike.  Commandant Grayza, though, takes the cake for me.  She not only does terrible things to the heroes, but she even goes out of her way to absolutely humiliate Scorpius, who is technically on her side.  Just about everything she does makes me feel like I need to take a shower.<br><br><b>Closing Thoughts</b><br><br>I would highly recommend this show to anyone.  It isn&#39;t afraid to go into some pretty dark territory, but it also doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously to have some fun.  I keeps a nice balance of drama and levity.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Well, let&#39;s jump on the bandwagon, shall we?<br>For some reason, I can&#39;t stand usual Magical Girl anime -- <i>Sailor Moon</i> causes me either to face-palm or laugh uproariously, depending on my mood, and I ran away from <i>Card Captor Sakura</i> after hearing its opening.<br>What I do like are subversions and deconstructions of the genre, and that&#39;s why I like MGLN. It starts as a fairly typical MG -- young girl finds a talking animal who gives her magical powers (or, in this case, a Device and tells her that she&#39;s got some -- read, unheard-of amount of power -- magical potential), and for the first four episodes it pretty much stays close to the usual once-per-episode-monster collect-all-MacGuffins formula. Then Fate appears and the series changes completely. Now, instead of a fluffy Magical Girl series, it becomes a character-driven drama... with giant magical lasers. Both Nanoha and Fate get large amounts of character development, and the visuals are simply awesome.<br>Another big plus is the soundtrack -- it is simply awesome, and serves its purpose (enhance the audience&#39;s identification with the setting and the characters) well.<br>Despite not being your average Magical Girl, the series manages to stay pretty idealistic, too, which is nice -- unlike, for example, Puella Magi Madoka Magica (another deconstruction of the genre) which is pretty dark and rather depressing (not that I have anything against PMMM).</p>

            <p>The first two seasons have been dubbed, so the DVDs should be avaible somewhere. (Although I would recommend subs, as the dub isn&#39;t that good)<br><br>The only way to watch the third series is subs, as it was never released outside Japan.</p>

            <p>Funny thing is, Nanoha is NOT the most powerful person in the show. All told, that&#39;d be Reinforce Eins, who died after three episodes. Then it&#39;s Hayate, who spends her first season as a wheelchair-bound sick girl, then barely gets to show her stuff in Season 3. That&#39;s another thing about Nanoha--it shows some consequences of the magical-girling;<br><br>For example, Hayate&#39;s power is on the level of a nuclear warhead. As such, the brass never allow her to use her power in the same situations as our heroes do, since that&#39;d be like using a tactical warhead on a fly. She only gets to use magic on a large scale a) out to sea, on a bunch of drones, and b) when a giant warship and robot army are taking over the city.<br><br>In addition, it shows what might ACTUALLY happen if a character went with the training-from-hell routine. Nanoha gets stronger, yeah, but in the longterm it ends up with her getting almost killed because she worked so unreasonably hard.<br><br>A third thing: By the second season, most of the conventional magical girl tropes are gone. Our heroes now have magical weapons which use cartridges, serve under a government agency (headed by the local Reasonable Authority Figure) and every villain has a REASON for what they&#39;re doing. There are no monster-of-the-weeks, and a significant portion of time is spent developing the &#39;villains&#39; and their motivations. It gets to the point where you honestly don&#39;t want anyone to lose, and wish that the circumstances would let them sit down and talk things out. </p>

            <p>What is it?<br><br>A series of Real-time-strategy games made by Blizzard Entertainment, perhaps a bit more famous for making World of Warcraft. And despite what many might tell you, it is not Warcraft in space! <br><br>Why do I like it so much?<br><br>I’ve always liked sci-fi settings, and StarCraft delivers everything that I want in a game: a superb storyline (if cheesy at times but still enjoyable), an awesome setting, and the best PvP action I’ve seen in a game since BF2. Multiplayer mode is a true game of skill and tactics. You have to learn how to read your opponent’s moves by elaborate guesswork and subtle scouting all while keeping your economy strong, foiling enemy scouting attempts, and building an army designed to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses. You have to react quickly when you opponent decides to push and, in my humble opinion, there is no greater satisfaction than outplaying your opponent with a well-placed drop or ingenious unit micro. Each race is fun to play (except for Zerg), each race has its own special tactics (except for Zerg, which is pure cheese), and each race has its special mechanics to help achieve victory (even Zerg, but it’s a pain in the neck to master).  <br></p>

            <p>What is it?<br><br>A long-running series of video games produced by Nintendo featuring a green-clad hero named Link who usually fights against the forces of evil in the land of Hyrule in order to rescue princess Zelda. <br><br>Why do I like it so much?<br><br>Ever since I first slotted the GBA version of A Link to the Past into my Gameboy Advance, I fell in love with this epic series. Even if the plot is always along the lines of “rescue the princess, slay monsters, defeat Ganondorf”, each game is filled with unique and memorable characters, awesome musical soundtracks with catchy songs, and a gripping storyline. Gameplay is always improved title after title and the developers always find a way to spice things up: the three-game-day limit in Majora’s Mask or the sailing component in Wind Waker added quite a lot of variety to the feel of each game. Combat itself is always entertaining and ranges from the old button-mashing style of the button controllers to the motion-sensitive swordplay of the Wii. <br><br>All in all, it’s an awesome adventure/fantasy series that I heartily recommend to anyone who’s interested. <br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been playing the Legend of Zelda games since I got my NES back in the late 80&#39;s.  I&#39;ve never gotten tired of this series.  I&#39;ve played most of the games.  The only ones I haven&#39;t played are on the DS or Wii.<br><br>My favorite game in the series is actually the game that some fans didn&#39;t like.  Majora&#39;s Mask is my favorite.  There is just so much going on in that game, with the journal, the time-travel, and the fact that things actually <i>change</i> if you do something.  I love it.  One of my favorite things, though, was the Bomb Mask.  You can act like a bomb if you run out of them.  Loved it.<br><br>Legend of Zelda is one of the reasons I go for the Nintendo consoles before anything else.  I even still have my NES, though someone walked off with my gold cartridge of the original Legend of Zelda.  They left a second copy of Adventure of Link in its place.  Not a fair trade, honestly.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>There&#39;s nothing quite like the feeling that you get when standing at the base of the Clock Tower during the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e056R97svz8"> final hour</a> and watching the moon come bearing down on you.<br><br>The <i>eyes</i>, man, the <i>eyes</i>...<br><br>My all-time favourite Zelda title has to be Skyward Sword. In my opinion, the combination of swordplay, item use, music, plot, and flying around make it the greatest in the series yet. If you have a Wii and don&#39;t play Zelda, Skyward Sword is a great introduction to one of Nintendo&#39;s finest series.<br></p>

            <p>Just so you all know, I finally broke down and went through the Unclaimed and Claimed Badfic lists. Anything older than 18 months on the Claimed Badfic list has been moved to Unclaimed; anything older than 18 months on the Unclaimed list is gone.<br><br>If you&#39;d like to re-claim something, please do, and make sure you put today&#39;s date on it for future reference. Please also update any existing claims that weren&#39;t moved.<br><br>Please refrain from re-reporting anything that got taken off the Unclaimed list, though, at least not right away. If it sat there without being touched for 18 months and more, it&#39;s not likely anyone is interested in taking it.<br><br>In other news, this all started thanks to Wikia deciding they need to upset my apple cart and make formatting done to section headers reflect in the page Table of Contents. This is annoying, because I&#39;ve spent quite some time bolding section headers since they decided not to do it automatically some time ago, and bolding in the TOC looks really stupid.<br><br>The good news is that I figured out how to make section headers automatically bold again, without it showing up in the TOC. The bad news is there&#39;s a crapton of bolded stuff still floating around. I&#39;d really appreciate it if all wiki editors chipped in to remove extraneous bolding when you see it. I&#39;ve already gotten started on some of the more important/high-traffic pages (such as the Claimed/Unclaimed Badfic lists), but every little bit means less work for me and a nicer-looking wiki. {= )<br><br>Also, the old HTML is out, and HTML5 is in. This means, among other things, that the &lt;font&gt; tag is no longer allowed. &lt;span style=&quot;(your CSS here)&quot;&gt; is preferred for that sort of thing.

I suspect the Sirius and Snape may be replacements, but I&#39;m not sure about Harry yet because there&#39;s so far no proof of Harry being this Raven kid but the babblings of Sirius and Snape, so it could be the probably!replacements pulling one over on him.<br><br>Oh, and -tosses a bottle of Bleeprin over- Here ya go. </p>

            <p>You can add:<br>1) Run-on sentences. Lots and lots of &#39;em.<br>2) Lack of capitalisation (not sure if this is a mini though).<br>3) Using Merlin as a God-replacement (&#39;Severus asked whilst inside he was praying to Merlin that the boy in front of him could somehow be his baby boy.&#39;)<br>4) You already have this, but: Snape is so OOC that he can&#39;t touch the canon with a ten-foot pole.<br>5) Harry is at the very least very, very OOC.

            <p>Mine were all from the first chapter, which I didn&#39;t even finish, so I can&#39;t say much on whether Harry&#39;s OOC enough to be a replacement.

I have a sneaking suspicion that <i>that is not something Severus Snape would do</i>.<br>7) Hmmm. That&#39;d be an uncanon nickname, which I think wouldn&#39;t create a mini-Aragog but would be a charge.<br>8) That&#39;s a pretty common thing in HP fanfic, actually, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s canon but it&#39;s pretty much accepted fanon.<br>9) -twitchtwitchtwitch-</p>

Sending a bunch of untrained recruits is a good way to not get the job done, and to lose a bunch of recruits in the process.<br><br>There is a method to the madness.

            <p>&#39;Course, three of the three of us had some clue what were were doing on that one, and had all been around a while, even if my actual PPC writing experience was close to non-existent at the time (a few false starts not really counting for much). And it still dragged on for... what, years, wasn&#39;t it? And never got finished properly, nor edited much. It&#39;s really kind of a terrible mess, if we&#39;re being honest. Totally fun to do, those times when actual writing was happening, but pretty messy all the way through. (I wouldn&#39;t mind going back and fixing that at some point, actually. I have a draft I&#39;d started cleaning up back when it was still in progress, somewhere.)<br><br>Erm. Ahem. Anyway.<br><br>Point is, I don&#39;t want to misrepresent how easy it is to pull off things like this even with experienced writers on board, since given the history of other such group projects, it&#39;s a feat that we even got as far as we did with &quot;Brown DragonRider.&quot; I agree it&#39;s important to remember the Rule of Funny, and that Team Newbie vs. Terrible Badfic could be done well (because anything <i>can</i> be done well), but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good idea for these writers right now. &quot;Wait until you have some experience first&quot; is good advice, and &quot;Wait until all of you have Permission&quot; is even better.<br><br>(In the meantime, for a really good example of Team Tryhard vs. Stacked Odds of Doom, try Andy and Saphie&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://www.misssandman.com/Suedom/index.html">Suedom</a>.&quot; It is unfinished, alas, but worth reading anyway.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Both as a writer and both for my characters. I started off with rather &quot;bland&quot; badfics, using moderately experienced Agents (one was supposed to have been in the PPC for about one year, the other had some months), and the only recruit I have now is being paired up with an Agent with a couple years experience (my fourth mission, &quot;A Very Awkward Exorcism&quot;, is probably a good example of newbye shakedown)<br><br>In the past years, there were some examples of complete newbyes sent into missions with so support - they survived by pure luck. Besides, every Agent that trained a recruit and got attached to him/her (Agent!Sergio Turbo, Keily Shinra and Laura Dukes + Danny Richardson are some of the best examples) would probably want to have a talk with the Marquis if they discover that a newbye duo was slaughtered during their first mission.<br><br>Well, Sergio would.</p>
