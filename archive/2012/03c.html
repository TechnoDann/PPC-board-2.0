            <p>Please welcome the agents of Response Center 15b: Department of Floaters~!<br><br>Agent #1- Robert Vernet, formerly known as Sherlock Holmes<br><br>Appearance: Wild, shaggy brown hair, dark eyes, and a faint stubble across his chin. Facial expression can best be described as &#39;pensive&#39;, unless you&#39;re in the Harry Potter continuum, where &#39;thoughtful&#39; will have to do. Tends to have a meerschaum pipe clenched between his teeth, full of Longbottom Leaf. Tall and bony. Wears the black uniform of an average PPC agent, with a Floater flash patch on his right shoulder... and a dark brown deerstalker hat and a long blue scarf. If asked about these accoutrements, he simply laughs.<br><br>Personality: Brilliant, arrogant, and just a leetle too self-confident. Vain, when it comes to his mental capacities, and responds a little TOO well to flattery. He&#39;s originally from the Victorian era, and was originally one of the &#39;leading men&#39; in a piece of slash. He has a number of hang-ups related to this. Has a highly addictive personality, though his addictions tend to be to ward off boredom. Before coming to the PPC, he smoked like a chimney, drank too much, did cocaine and morphine, played World of Warcraft, and watched entirely too much bad daytime TV. Now, he doesn&#39;t really get bored, so he mostly restrains himself to the wide, WIDE array of bleeproducts available to agents. Doesn&#39;t make friends easily. A bit of a loner. Tries to be coolly logical, like his (original) namesake. Some days he is better at this than others. Has inherited his namesake&#39;s deductive skills, and tastes in most areas. Talks like a book, and never uses a one dollar word where a ten-dollar word would do. Oh, and his RC looks like it&#39;s a mess, but he&#39;s got an &#39;idiosyncratic&#39; (read- completely batsh*t) system of keeping everything where it goes.<br><br>History: Robert comes from an Implausible Crossover RP- South Park/Sherlock Holmes. In this fic, instead of barely surviving his plunge from the Reichenbacher Falls, Holmes fell through a portal into South Park. General hilarity and some slash-y romance ensued. When the PPC came to clean things up, they found themselves with a problem, in the form of one Sherlock Holmes. In canon, Holmes is repeatedly stated to be rather sexless, and almost emotionless. However, while this Holmes was more than capable of emotion, and had fallen in love with (an adult version of) a South Parkian, he wasn&#39;t a Gary Stu. He was like Paddlebrains- a legitimate, functional Character Replacement. Long story short, he decided to work with the PPC rather than die. His name&#39;s Robert in homage to Robert Downey Jr., and Vernet because he always liked the name. (It was a relative of his.) He&#39;s at the PPC for almost a year now, and has already driven two partners off (they couldn&#39;t handle his &#39;quirks&#39;.)<br><br>Weapons: A sword-cane, which he can use as either a sword or a singlestick, and a revolver. He&#39;s an accomplished boxer, and has trained- but is not very good- at the Japanese art of Baritsu.<br><br>Lust Objects: John Watson and Irene Adler, from Sherlock Holmes; Christophe &#39;ze Mole&#39; DeLorne from South Park; L from Death Note; Charlie Epps from Numb3rs; River Tam from Firefly.<br><br>Fandoms: Anything remotely Sherlock Holmes related, Death Note, Numb3rs, Lie to Me, South Park, Firefly, Ender&#39;s Game, and Lord of the Rings. He enjoys any canon that&#39;s big and complicated and has well-defined rules. He really loathes bad Holmes adaptations, and HATES Psych.<br><br>~~~<br><br>Character #2: Mundar o&#39; the Five Hills (A.K.A. Mr. Fivehills)<br><br>Appearance: Mundar&#39;s a dwarf. As such, he&#39;s short, squat, and thick-boned. His beard&#39;s long, thick, ruddy, dirty, and beer-soaked red. He TRIES to braid it, but ends up leaving it half-done and/or coming apart. He&#39;s also got a full head of thick, wild, dirty ginger hair. His skin&#39;s tanned, almost weatherbeaten, and also dirty, he seems to have a permanent layer of grime about him. He&#39;s got twinkling, dark eyes, and a merry, cunning look to his face. He&#39;s bare-chested and barefoot, though he wears a black kilt with the Floater flash patch on it. He refuses to wear any other clothing. Unfortunately for the rest of the PPC, he&#39;s discovered Jayne&#39;s Hat, and wears a replica of it, as often as Vernet will permit.<br><br>Personality: Mundar is cunning, shrewd, and a wee bit of an anarchist. He&#39;s obsessed with his own personal freedom, and will do anything to flaunt the fact that he&#39;s &#39;free-er&#39; than you. In fact, he is the freest dwarf ever. Any who dare to challenge this claim are met with a first-hand view of what lies under his kilt, until they require large amounts of bleeprin. If Mundar&#39;s life is threatened, he&#39;ll announce that he&#39;ll die a free dwarf and rip off his kilt. He&#39;s hearty, laughing, and fond of drink and song. Usually all of those together at once. He&#39;s extremely gay- his straight, male creator made him so for the LOLs- but is firmly in the closet, and won&#39;t admit to any of his LOs. He has a bad habit of using any piece of paper in reach as a towel/toilet paper. Vernet has taken to leaving a copy of &#39;New Moon&#39; out for him to use for the purpose. Mundar is having some trouble adjusting to PPC life, for three reasons: First, he is having some trouble adjusting to the idea of following the rules/charging Sues instead of killing them on sight/not being able to drink 24/7. After a few run-ins with the Flowers that Be, he&#39;s grudgingly following the rules he needs to follow, and ignoring the rest. Secondly, he can&#39;t read. Vernet is teaching him, and he&#39;s learning Canon from books on tape, but until then, it puts him at a disadvantage when it comes to the Words. Thirdly, he clashes with his partner a lot. Vernet likes stability and order, and is less than patient with people who break the rules; Mundar is nothing if not chaotic and unruly. Their arguments are legendary.<br><br>History: Mundar is a minor character from an original Dungeons and Dragons campaign setting named &#39;Erythos&#39;. He was supposed to be a friendly NPC, assisting the heroes. Once his role in the campaign was up, his author had no idea of what to do with him. He let an authoress adopt him. Said authoress promptly stuck him in the PPC, where he&#39;s been languishing ever since. <br><br>Weapons: He&#39;d prefer his axe; failing that, pretty much any heavy weapon. He&#39;s not averse to using his fists either.<br><br>Fandoms: Lord of the Rings, Firefly, Pokemon, Order of the Stick, and Artemis Fowl. He has a guilty weakness for Twilight, though he&#39;d never admit this to any of the other agents.<br><br>LOs: Gimli, son of Gloin, from LOTR; Mulch Diggums, from Artemis Fowl, Jayne Cobb from Firefly; Jacob Black, from Twilight. Of course, he won&#39;t admit to any of these.<br><br>Writing Sample:<br>[From Axis Powers: Hetalia canon.]<br>The Rules of War<br><br>  A chill hung in the air, seeping its way through the tears in England&#39;s red uniform.  He watched the land retreat from the deck of the Indomitable, a sick knot of fear twisting in his guts. Carrion birds circled high in the cloudy, gray sky. Blood hung in the water of the Mississippi River, and corpses in red and blue sprawled along its banks. The cold, salt smell of the sea lingered in the air, sending a shiver down his spine.<br> It was sunset, January eighth, in the year of the Lord 1814. The Battle of New Orleans was over. <br>   He had lost. <br>   America had made a fool of him again. It wasn&#39;t enough that England had had to lose the first bloody war, oh, no. America had to torment him again. All because he wouldn&#39;t see reason. It was no use expecting Alfred to be reasonable,  but Arthur had to try, if only because he didn&#39;t want to give up on the brat. <br>    England bit his lower lip and paced the deck, letting himself wallow in self-pity for a while. A cool breeze whipped his bangs back and made his massive eyebrows bunch together for warmth. Images of the battle hovered behind his closed eyes.<br>   He saw America leading the charge over the redoubt he&#39;d captured. In his mind&#39;s eye, Alfred&#39;s face was gashed, dripping blood down his cheek. His face was pale, pale as a ghost&#39;s, and his eyes were wild. His dingy blue uniform hung off him like a torn sack, and he waved a howitzer in the air, swaggering like a common thug.<br>    “C&#39;mon, boys, let&#39;s get &#39;em!” he&#39;d yelled. <br> England couldn&#39;t think of Alfred as anything but a sweetheart, but in that moment, he&#39;d seemed to be a demon. <br>  He saw other images, too. All around him, his men fell to the ground. Legions and legions of redcoats dying like so many flies, and a sharp pain in his gut every time one of them fell. The blue-coated Americans moving like monsters in the fog. A gout of  fire coming from America&#39;s flamethrower-<br>     /Wait a second.../<br>  England snorted. <br>   /He cheated! That little git cheated!/<br>  He opened his eyes, waking from his reverie, and strode over to the bright red switch on the Indomitable&#39;s cabin wall. It looked hideously out of place- it was made of plastic, and its smooth curves fitted the thirtieth century far better than the nineteenth. Yet, oddly enough, none of the crew seemed to notice.<br>   There was no good reason why they should. After all, they weren&#39;t real.<br>     England pulled the switch and the world faded around him. One second, he seemed to be standing on the swaying deck of a ship that hadn&#39;t existed for a thousand years, and the next, he was lying on his back, in the deceleration chamber of the Diana&#39;s games room. The artificial gravity made him feel ill, as always.<br>  America lounged on the other couch, looking over at him. The bigger nation&#39;s blond hair was a tousled mess, and his eyes were bright with amusement.<br>    “Have a good nap, Iggy?”</p>

            <p>As a general rule, as long as the permission givers can verify that your writing sample is reasonably within the bounds of canon, it&#39;s no big deal which canon it is. So if you&#39;re into Hetalia, posting that is fine. It just means whoever is reviewing your application needs to ask someone who follows Hetalia and is reasonably trustworthy about it. We&#39;ve got quite a few fans around here, as I recall, so that shouldn&#39;t be a problem. It&#39;s one of the benefits of being an absurdly widespread group-- name a fandom, and we&#39;ll have someone around who knows it.<br><br>As for being pedantic, definitely don&#39;t worry about that. We&#39;re pedants to a one, here, generally about different things. Again, diversity-- name a subject, obscure as you like, and I assure you we have someone here who is very, very picky about the accurate details.<br><br>(I don&#39;t think you come off as immature or annoying, either, for the record. Excitable, perhaps, but certainly nothing to worry about. You just haven&#39;t been around for very long, is all.)</p>

            <p>VM said <i>why</i> you haven&#39;t gotten permission and how can can get permission, but I have some further concerns.<br><br>While you are trying to meet the various &#39;steps&#39; you aren&#39;t really encouraging us to give you permission. <br><br>Your initial permission showed little apparent effort to it. The writing- spelling and grammar- was sloppy, and you used shortcuts to make and tell us about your characters rather than show us. (I also looked back, checked and discovered that your writing sample there that &#39;parodies&#39; a RvB PSA was also plagiarism.) You even figured it was likely to fail. While it might not have been your intent, it can look like you were figuring that would excuse the slack standards you held yourself to for that writing sample and the characters. Expecting failure doesn&#39;t really impress or put confidence into others in your work or yourself, especially when it is what you gave us.<br><br>Your second permission attempt didn&#39;t really show much thought put into what you were presenting either. Again, it was a plagiarized piece, for the writing sample, and your characters went in concerning ways; as Neshomeh noted they&#39;re more interested in insulting and making cruel comments than in actually doing anything for canon, and your writing was also dismissive of both canon and of your readers. Beyond that, there&#39;s also the item I had mentioned there, with regards to one of your agents having Lust Objects that are both very young in comparison to his given age.  That, as I mentioned, can be creepy- it&#39;s also something that can be discomforting to some people.<br><br>When people brought up that it was plagiarized, you basically waved it off, giving an incorrect definition. While you might not have understood the meaning of &#39;plagiarization&#39;, learning to not copy the works of others and passing it off as your own- especially in terms of creative works- is something that everyone learns early in school and has drummed into their heads throughout their education.  As I said in this thread already, dismissing that isn&#39;t impressive, and when you treat it as being alarmist, that&#39;s also not something that encourages us- as Permission Givers- to consider giving you permission, even in the future.<br><br>Being sound technically doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be granted permission. We care about the PPC canon as it is; about our reputations as writers- plagiarism is a huge deal. Putting no effort or care into your works is, too. We care about what we write. We care about not being bullies. Our reputuation is important to us; when you write something that is actually bad, or is plagiarized, it reflects badly upon all of us. <br><br>So far your attempts have been contradictory to most of those points. No or little effort, cribbing, outright mean comments. These are things that are important, too. These are things that I take into consideration, as do others. And it&#39;s also something we consider for later attempts.<br><br>While VM&#39;s response was technically correct, I&#39;m going to put it straight to the point: Our constitution very explicitly states we do not approve of plagiarists. A lot of the stuff you&#39;ve done for your attempts doesn&#39;t secure in our minds that you&#39;re someone who&#39;ll not plagiarize again, and that you won&#39;t go for mean, low effort missions.<br><br>Show us that you&#39;re making moves to improve your writing and actually working care and effort into it. Chat on the board, in the chatroom. Do things that are actually community-building. <br><br>While I can&#39;t order or demand you to do anything, I heavily suggest that you hold off on asking for permission again until you&#39;re able to do that sort of thing and it doesn&#39;t raise suspicions on our parts.<br></p>

            <p>First off, you <i>have</i> joined the PPC. You&#39;re in. You&#39;re One of Us. You post on the &#39;Board and you talk to people and join conversations, ergo you are a PPCer.<br><br>Now, as to your actual question, how to get permission... that&#39;s a bit trickier. I&#39;m trying to remember what the issues were with your previous attempts, and the first thing that comes to mind is that you didn&#39;t wait very long at all between them. Give it some time - do some reading, some thinking, some drawing-board-time, and, <i>very</i> importantly, send your stuff to betas for review. I can&#39;t recommend that enough - it is very, very important that you get your stuff proofread and beta&#39;d.<br><br>There&#39;s no limit to the amount of times you apply for Permission, but if you keep throwing yourself against the door every week or so, you&#39;re going to more annoy people than increase your chance of a positive response.<br><br>Just... proofread your stuff. Submit an original writing sample that you&#39;ve taken good care of (because we&#39;ll expect you to be taking good care of <i>all</i> your writings), and look around for agents that work. There&#39;s no Winning Formula-- just do your best, and the key to that is making sure it <i>is</i> your best. As in, you&#39;ve worked hard and spent time on it, and cared about the quality enough to put it through the ringer of editing.</p>

            <p>Before I say anything else, let me just say this...<br><br>Cut it out. I defer to much of what VM said in her recent post about how disclaimers don&#39;t exactly cover that, especially when you&#39;re copying entire things of better, more well known series.<br><br>Now, here&#39;s the thing that bugs me about this only slightly less than the fact that it&#39;s plagiarism:<br><br>You say that it&#39;s a parody of something from a different source material. But here&#39;s the thing: simply transcribing things doesn&#39;t make it funny. There has to be a spin on it that you add that pokes fun at how the source material uses it. From what I&#39;ve heard around here, there&#39;s nothing of the sort in either of your writing samples.<br><br>So let&#39;s dispell this notion that you have that you&#39;re parodying something here, because when we get to the nitty gritty of it, you&#39;re really not parodying anything at all. The context apparently was only changed superficially: for a &quot;parody&quot; to work, it needs to involve more than that. I may point out that this kind of &#39;I&#39;m copying something directly, look, laugh at it&#39; is one part of the biggest mistake that Seltzerberg movies frequently make. The pop culture references that are littered throughout those movies are incredibly unfunny for the reason I just mentioned above, and simply copying and pasting something for the sake of &quot;parody&quot; is both incredibly lazy and not cool.<br><br>*groan*<br><br>Honestly, GR? I have to say I&#39;m pretty disappointed in you. I take you for a rather reasonable guy most of the time: the  fact that you&#39;re brushing off the fact that you&#39;ve plagiarized something doesn&#39;t sit well with me.<br><br>I find it <i>especially</i> alarming that you&#39;re brushing off these concerns of plagiarism, since you were pretty vocal about how angry you were about an entirely different case of plagiarism elsewhere. The fact that you got mad about the plagiarized Assassin&#39;s Creed/Mass Effect fanfic I mentioned in one of my DA journals and now the fact that you&#39;re plagiarizing Red Vs. Blue...<br><br>I hate to say it, but it kind of paints you as a <i>hypocrite</i>.</p>

            <p>(Yes, you are allowed to use a link to get to the writing sample.) There are other issues, which were mainly covered in the responses to your application directly - mainly, your writing samples, to be honest, looked slap-dash, hasty, and sloppy. As Neshomeh pointed out, your piece mostly consisted of a few characters being crude and insulting - and your dialogue was plagiarized. There were also July&#39;s concerns about your agents. But what I&#39;d like to focus on, what I feel you really are not grasping the depth of, is the plagiarism aspect.<br><br>Putting up a disclaimer does not change the facts. Plagiarism is plagiarism. A disclaimer can &#39;cover&#39; things like &quot;I took a few story elements from this &#39;fic,&quot; or &quot;This was inspired by an AU that started with the same idea,&quot; or the like.<br><br>For example, the following is acceptable: <i>I got the idea for this story from &quot;Patching Through,&quot; by Snarksaysgo, but it goes in a different direction, as I have a different take on the characters.</i><br><br>This is what you wrote for your first writing sample: <i>Here&#39;s an expert from a Glee fanfic I made that parodies a Red vs Blue PSA:</i> You didn&#39;t parody the episode. You wrote something directly transcribing the dialogue (or copy-pasted it from a transcript) and put it in your own characters&#39; mouths. That&#39;s plagiarism. The disclaimer cannot cover it, because there is no way to cover &quot;I copy-pasted the majority of this text from someone else&#39;s stuff.&quot;<br><br>Then you did the same thing with your second writing sample. Your disclaimer there might be more clear: &quot;<i>with yet another PSA from the minds at Rooster Teeth.</i>&quot; But again, what you need to say is &quot;All the dialogue in this writing sample is directly taken from Rooster Teeth.&quot; Which makes it <i>plagiarism</i>. Which is <i>wrong</i>. You&#39;re not adapting parts of a story, you&#39;re facelifting it and changing the names of the speaking characters. That&#39;s not fanfic, it&#39;s not good writing, and, again, it&#39;s <i>plagiarism</i>.<br><br>You&#39;re sort of acting like nothing is wrong, or brushing off concerns, which is not exactly reassuring to those of us you&#39;re asking for permission. Please try to look at this from our point of view - you posted a copy-pasted &#39;parody,&#39; didn&#39;t get called on that aspect of it, and then did the same thing again, and did. When people told you it was plagiarism, you insisted that it wasn&#39;t, and never really backed down or apologized. As a permission giver, this does not exactly fill me with confidence that you won&#39;t do the same thing with your PPC agents.</p>

            <p>It was absolutely horrific, my six Mary Sues &quot;fell&quot; into the Naruto universe and had senseless, Mary-Sue-esque adventures, and one was the &quot;six-tailed cat&quot; Jinchuuriki (I was eleven, shut up). I rewrote it a bunch, making it a more surreal type of thing with believable (I hope) characters (AND NO SONGFIC CHAPTERS, still can&#39;t believe I thought that was a good idea), but then I forgot to save the old version... too bad, because I really, really wanted to request a sporking of it.

            <p>I honestly can&#39;t remember my own fanfic, but my first effort at an original story was a monster containing nearly ten Mary Sues, dozens of plot points pulled from various undesirable places, and more self-inserts than you can poke a stick at (I went around asking various friends and fellow students if they wanted to be in it). It was terrible, and I&#39;m sorry I ever thought of it.</p>

            <p>I have, however, been monitoring a situation with an individual calling themselves &quot;Sonic Rhymeboom&quot;, a name which I can only assume was taken from a conversation I had in the IRC. Said person (referred to as &quot;Sonic&quot; from now on) has been going around and reporting PPC missions to the subjects of said missions. So far Sonic has hit Tray and Guvnor&#39;s pokemon/zombie crossover mission, Herr&#39;s &quot;Rainbow Dash goes to the Mushroom Kinkdom&quot; mission, Miah&#39;s &quot;Sateda&quot; and &quot;Burn Notice: Season 8&quot; mission, Nesh&#39;s &quot;Magic World&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Love&quot; missions, Firemagic&#39;s &quot;Saigo no Tanjoobi&quot; mission, Ellipsis Flood&#39;s &quot;Comic to Fruition&quot; mission, and July&#39;s &quot;The Forgotten Child&quot; mission. It is, of course, entirely possible that a few missions have been missed, but I think that gets the point across.<br><br>Thus far, all of the comments/reviews/whatever you want to call them have been almost direct copies of one another, with minor alterations here and there. The first one, Tray and Guv&#39;s mission, was done as an anonymous review under the name &quot;A Fan&quot;, but it&#39;s clearly the same person. As far as I know, the only thing to come of it so far is that the authors of the fic Tray and Guv tackled wrote a revenge fic, in which their Sue and Stu killed Tray and Guv&#39;s agent. Not sure if anything more came of that.</p>

            <p>We should be listening to authors after their stories have been sporked. Yes, the person who responded to Tray and Guv was petty and juvenile, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can blanket-ignore everyone we please. Sometimes, people make good points; although we never intend to be bullies, <s>I bloody well hope,</s> that line can get fuzzy, and it can be crossed. And if someone comes to us and goes &quot;Hey, that line of bullying? You just crossed it,&quot; we&#39;d better be willing to listen. For example, when a bunch of people began to write essays about why the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; was sexist (and, yes, why the PPC was a bunch of bullies), most of us disagreed... but because as a community, we listened to their criticisms and thought about what they had to say, a very productive discussion about bullying, and that line we try not to cross, came up. I think we&#39;ve been a lot more aware of potentially sexist terminology and tropes since then, and I&#39;m glad the whole thing happened.<br><br>Also, to be honest, my response to people going &quot;You did <i>what</i> to my story?!&quot; is to think &quot;...Wait, nobody told you?&quot; I seriously think we should be giving concrit on stories before we go after them - doing that kind of pretty much takes all the wind out of jerks like Rhymeboom&#39;s sails, and keeps us from looking like hypocrites. After all, if we do care more about goodfic and writing quality than simply blasting things we don&#39;t like, concrit should be our first response anyway. If people ignore the concrit, or respond with the typical response of upset children everywhere, then... it&#39;s different. But it seems like our standards really should be to try to help before going in for the kill - we concrit each other, we should give fanfic authors that chance, too.<br><br>So I&#39;m sorta opposed to responding to angry badfic authors with various comically oversized weapons; I think as a community we can do a lot better than the people we complain about by responding to criticisms, instead of attacking them.<br><br>*climbs off soapbox*<br><br>...er, carry on.</p>

            <p>Remember, folks, we&#39;re anti-badfic, not anti-author. If any authors do show up here to complain, our best defense is to welcome them like we would anyone else and treat them with civility.<br><br>Also, listen to VM, she is wise. I&#39;ve been making more of an effort to leave reviews myself because of all the stuff she mentioned. So far nothing has come of it except that it makes Sonic Rhymeboom look like a spiteful idiot, but that suits me well in itself. Having thought it through, there are really very few good reasons <i>not</i> to leave reviews in the face of all the reasons to do it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Just like the Star Trek one, except this one is inspired by Power Rangers and the general super sentai genre. Pick a role that isn&#39;t taken and jump in. I will be playing the role of Evilatrix Sparklesa. Boarders and Agents are both allowed in, and in multiples; but please try to let people pick a ranger role, and don&#39;t populate a team by yourself! If they all fill up, feel free to come up with a Sixth Ranger type following one of the styles for the three ranks, or join in on the side of evil!<br><br><br><br>For those of you not aware of how super sentai show or Power Rangers episodes normally go, it usually goes:<br> a) characters have some sort of unrelated dilemna<br> b) characters encounter one of the head villain&#39;s plans in action or are alerted to one in action by whoever is their leader/mentor figure <br>c) characters begin fighting- physical attacks only, no weapons.<br>d) the monster/villain of the week shows up; the protagonists pull out their weapons, which usually involves long attack names<br>e) This doesn&#39;t work, monster/villain of the week either gets really huge or jumps into a giant mecha<br>f) Characters jump into their own mecha- these are usually animal themed and shaped<br>g) Characters are not successful in fighting monster/villain like this separately<br>h) Characters combine their mecha into a giant fighting robot with a joined bridge/cockpit<br>i) Awesome robot fight<br>j) Explosions<br>k) Heroes win]<br></p>

            <p>Lessee, as for video games, I love the Zelda franchise and am a  casual fan of Phoenix Wright.  I say casual since I&#39;ve only played those games a little but have liked what I&#39;ve seen.  Show wise, I&#39;m new to Walking Dead having only read the first trade and seeing the second half of season 2 but am really excited about it.<br>Lessee, I also loved Jeremiah.  You may or may not know what that show was but if anyone does, I will love them for it.</p>

            <p>Dawn:<br>It&#39;s about a &quot;shadow priest&quot; who is in Middle Earth to find her broken necklace. Why the necklace is so important I don&#39;t know. Also, she hates everything in the story. Elves, Rivendell (or as she says: rivindell), sunlight, even the air itself. Also, Gandalf is &quot;a hippie&quot;, and not very bright (like all hippies). Finally, the character claims that grammar is useless, and thus ignores it&#39;s rules (and spelling). Finally, she reminds me a lot of Ebony (of My Immortal), with her name (Rraven or Raven, it changes back and forth), her shadow powers (which include invincibility, shapechange into a raven, and healing anything (the sword that the ringwraiths use, which could only be cured by Elrond himself.)

            <p>Since we are all sharing really bad fanfics, here&#39;s one that makes me just want to bash my head up against a wall and never stop : <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3540868/1/">The Power of Magic and Elves</a><br>It&#39;s a brain breaking crossover between LOTR and Harry Potter, in which Harry is uncanonicly tortured by Voldemort and is then teleported to Middle Earth, where he is transformed into an eleven child. He is accompanied by his pet griffin which has a stupid name.He is then found by Aragorn and shit only gets worse from there.</p>

            <p>Well I stumbled onto the PPC through TV Tropes, and after reading through the Original Series and bouncing around the wiki for a couple of days I thought I&#39;d come over here and introduce myself.<br><br>Reading (mostly Sci Fi and Fantasy) has been a passion of mine ever since I can remember, and several years ago I started writing an original work, which a couple of years ago basically collapsed under its own weight. Recently I thought about doing some short stories to try and ease my way back into writing, and the PPC seems like a brilliant place to do that; I just love the concept of Agents going in a fixing the problems badfic can cause. My first foray into &#39;the Pit&#39; has left me with a healthy respect for what that stuff can do to your brain. <br><br>My fanons are far, far to numerous to list (partly because I feel that I&#39;ve rambled enough already, mostly because I doubt I could list them all from memory anyway. Picking a few at random; Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, Old Kingdon/Abhorsen, Ghost in the Shell, Star Wars and James Bond. <br><br>So, yeah... hello everyone *waves*   <br><br></p>

            <p>As many of you know, the Hunger Games movie came out yesterday, and was met with much enthusiasm. This excitement will most definitely result in a fanfic explosion of epic proportions. We at the PPC should prepare ourselves for the inevitable badfic as best we can. Good luck to all agents working in this continuum.</p>

            <p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, there was too much bad fanfiction in that fandom to begin with. Now. . . *shudder* I&#39;m especially scared, because the advertisers are trying to pass off the hunger games as the next Twilight, so we may see an influx of those fans.<br>Oh well. The only thing we can do is prepare for the oncoming rush and hope that the movie attracted as many good writers as bad ones.<br>The movie was awesome though.

            <p>What&#39;s this? A good movie that adheres to the source material faithfully? Why, I never!<br><br>So my thoughts, in a nutshell:<br><br>It was faithful to the book, everything was exactly how I imagined it would look from when I read the books, Jennifer Lawrence was great, the acting was great, it covered pretty much everything, I cried when Rue died, and overall I liked it.<br><br>If there&#39;s one complaint I could level at it... well, I&#39;d wonder where some of the world-building went. Also, it was quite clumsily edited, and Gary Ross could <i>really</i> use some lessons in how to direct an action scene.<br><br>But everything else was so good I found I could forgive those issues. </p>

            <p>It did go along with the book much more than I expected *having flashbacks to the Percy Jackson movie*. The only things that bothered me was that they didn&#39;t include Madge, and that they didn&#39;t fully explain her background story. However, seeing as it was a two and a half hour movie I think they just sacrificed the details for the sake of time. Plus, there were some little added bits that I liked<br>&quot;Caesar, do I smell like roses?&quot;</p>

            <p>I read this fanfiction and have to say that I really like it.<br>I don&#39;t really get what your problem is. I don&#39;t see any &quot;screwing up relationships&quot; or &quot;not being satisfied with the entire heartwarming ending&quot;. I also don&#39;t really get what exactly should be called heartwarming about the anime&#39;s ending even Gen Urobuchi says that he was too cruel. Homura never gets to physically see Madoka again after retrying to save her friend again and again she ends up all alone again. Looks like you didn&#39;t see Homura&#39;s gaze after the ending in the last episode, she didn&#39;t look too happy then after all... The only real heartwarming part of this episode is when Homura and Madoka are together in space but the rest is cruel to Homura and not &quot;heartwarming&quot; at all. After trying so hard all the time she just gets to fight alone again. And I don&#39;t think she&#39;d get very close to Mami and Kyoko, maybe a little bit closer to Kyoko but that&#39;s it, in the end she&#39;s all alone again.<br><br>Also about the &quot;screwing up&quot; relationships all I see is a fanfic that tries to give the character&#39;s a (happy) yuri end where all of them are together. And writing a yuri fanfiction is not &quot;screwing up relationships&quot;. Many parts of the anime can be interpreted as yuri. Or why else do you think is this anime so popular among yuri fans? If you don&#39;t get what I mean go and watch Kannazuki no Miko. In my opinion you pretty much look like someone who hates yuri and doesn&#39;t understand it. I am not saying that everyone needs to like yuri but if you aren&#39;t tolerant enough to let others be the way they&#39;re then you&#39;re pretty retarded.<br>For Homura and Madoka as a couple I would exactly display them how the author did. I&#39;d imagine them having a deep, strong love for each other where only feelings matter. (Although Homura seems to be a bit of a pervert after all, considering that she &quot;knows the value of used underwear&quot;.)<br>I&#39;d imagine Kyoko and Sayaka would have a relationship where both are a bit shy and have problems showing their feelings for each other though forming slowly a strong bond with each other.<br><br>I also don&#39;t get why you mean by saying &quot;giving characters abilities they shouldn&#39;t have&quot;...<br><br>And I don&#39;t think that the author does what he/she wants. The author rather tries to  give (as I already mentioned before) the character&#39;s the end he/she would have liked in my opinion and doesn&#39;t srew anything up and I think he/she really did very well when trying to portray the character&#39;s feelings. It feels kinda a bit as if the dialogues came from the anime itself. An author is still allowed to put their own ideas and feelings in a fanfiction, too. Or why do you think exist fanfictions at all? This fanfiction&#39;s purpose seems to be some kind of continuation with a proposed shoujo-ai end. (it&#39;s obvious to see what kind of end this fanfiction will have after all)<br><br>(I know my English isn&#39;t very good, I&#39;m French.)</p>

            <p>Anyways... One, I liked the ending, but anyways that&#39;s beside the point. This completely messes up the ending, as in it gives Madoka and Homura powers they shouldn&#39;t have. For example, after the end, I don&#39;t think Homura can go back in time. Even if she COULD, that shouldn&#39;t allow Madoka to appear on Earth. Also, why did Madoka going back in time make Sayaka appear in an explosion? Why could Sayaka remember being in Puella Magi heaven? <br><br>The screwing up relationships--no, I&#39;m not referring to the yuri, I&#39;m talking about the relations between Homura and Sayaka. And I quote:<br><br>&quot;I  grunt quietly, she&#39;s the one I did never really like too much because she was the one who ended up being the closest to Madoka, after a few times of time revision, and she was also often very rude to me&quot;<br><br>No, that&#39;s not why Homura disliked Sayaka. Homura&#39;s not possessive, and she wants Madoka to be happy. She&#39;s become DETACHED from Sayaka because she knows she will become a witch or die, not because she was stealing Madoka from her.<br><br>I don&#39;t hate yuri. I love the yuri relationships between Madoka and Homura, Sayaka and Kyoko, and in other animes. It&#39;s just that this fanfic messes up the other relationships between characters in the anime, the friendships. <br><br>Oh, and one more thing: &quot;It had really been great to see my parents again after such an extremely long time, since Akemi-san had been able to save this world from getting destroyed for long 1000 years, even when the last human was killed and no other Puella Magis except her existed, she still fought, hoping to save Madoka from becoming a witch. She and Madoka had been talking, again and again when Madoka had found a way to talk to her. But after sometime Akemi-san&#39;s Soul Gem had turned black but she didn&#39;t die, she cried, tried to make Madoka kill her but Madoka would never kill her, she just told her that Akemi-san had become an angel and even a corrupted Soul Gem, couldn&#39;t kill her, in fact all wounds of the world wouldn&#39;t kill her, she had become immortal.<br>As she didn&#39;t need to clean her soul gem anymore, she fought more and she nearly became mad, like I had so often in the old universe, but Madoka was always able to keep her sane, cheer her up and make her fight on.&quot;<br><br>What a wonderful idea, except for a) it was never established in previous chapters that Homura was anything but a regular Puella, b) the demons apparently destroyed the world a short time after Madoka&#39;s wish, not a thousand years later (and even then, if human civilization was gone, why did Madoka wait that long?) and most egregiously, c) that is all apparently taken from the goodfic A History of Magic, which takes the time to establish the Angels and makes it work with good writing. This fic seems to have plagiarized it without doing anything that made the original good.<br><br>Also, please read the Board Constitution--specifically rules 2 and 4.</p>

            <p>... is that this is plausible. In a sick, twisted, horrible way, the whole trilogy has a viable plot. We&#39;ve all seen Fluttershy&#39;s alternate self- she can be absolutely vicious if need be. Remember what happened to the dragon and the Royal Gardens&#39; fauna? So why not a monstrosity like this hidden away in Celestia? Everyone else seems fairly in-character for the most part. There&#39;s not even much bad biology, aside from the whole horn-as-a-phallus thing.<br><br> A monster hidden away in an otherwise wonderful pony is totally workable. It&#39;s just that our pervy Streak took it in the wrong direction and wrote clop. Honestly, he&#39;d be really good if he&#39;d just take the time to stop and ask himself whether he really needs to be able to fap to his writing. His grammar and spelling are good and he sure has a handle on the characters, at least in the trilogy. Not so much in his other fics. Like that AppleSpike grapefruit monstrosity of a rapefic. I guess it&#39;s sort of like hentai. There&#39;s totally a plot, but it revolves almost entirely around sex scenes. Being able to make that work is actually kind of disgusting and amazing at the same time.<br><br> I might spork the AppleSpike fic when I get my Permit. It&#39;s legitimately bad writing, entirely OOC, and with no plot.<br><br> Honestly, I can totally accept the cloppers. Am I grossed out? Buck yes. Am I going to make fun of them? Relentlessly. Does it deserve to be sporked? Yes. Do I hate them? No. They just have a weird fetish is all. If I hated the cloppers, I wouldn&#39;t be much of a Brony, considering that, you know, the whole fandom sort of revolves around love and tolerance. It&#39;s just that... Well, the explicit stuff needs to go to the Über Pit of Voles and stay there. That&#39;s what the place is for. The regular Pit isn&#39;t the place for it is all.<br><br> Honestly, I&#39;m thinking of adapting the &quot;monster locked away in Celestia&quot; plot for a fic of my own. But this monster shall be no rapist. It will be a killer. Tell me now if this is a bad idea. The deaths will be confined to background characters and OCs, but I don&#39;t want to go over the edge here.</p>

            <p>None of this makes SENSE! You&#39;re basing justification on one pony having a darker side, which doesn&#39;t mean that all of them do.<br><br>Just because the characters snap in comedic manner sometimes is not justification for crazed pornography or Saw-style bloodfics--that&#39;s escalation to a point where it doesn&#39;t fit the setting or the characters anymore. I mean, seriously--&quot;Remember what happened to the dragon and the Royal Gardens&#39; fauna?&quot; Yeah, they got screamed at a bit. She got frustrated, she lost her temper. She didn&#39;t HURT either of them!<br><br>This kind of thing is what produces atrocities like Cupcakes or Rainbow Factory, and I haven&#39;t seen anything in Celestia&#39;s character so far that would remotely suggest support for some kind of murderous rampage. You would have to stretch a LONG way to make that work, and I sincerely doubt you could.<br><br>Writing something like that might really hurt your chances of getting Permission, too--it tends to reflect badly on a potential PPCer if they&#39;re writing the sort of things we normally target.</p>

            <p>*adjusts glasses*<br><br> Yes, but... Well, Celestia has to have some sort of psych issues. It&#39;s difficult to be alive for that long and not go at least a little nutty. Banishing Luna surely took a toll. Then there&#39;s the loss of so many generations of friends- some maybe closer than others. Not to mention the stress of ruling a country and basically being a goddess. Some people have been known to just snap under the strain. She may be immortal, but her mind is clearly shown to have the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities as anyone else&#39;s. Anger isn&#39;t always the cause of murder.<br><br> I assure you that, were I to write something of that sort, it would be more in the vein of Death Note, where we focus on the investigation, the rush to find the killer, and the dangerous duel between minds, and the scheming and plotting on both sides. No &quot;Saw&quot; antics for me. The fandom has had enough of that between Cupcakes and Sweet Apple Massacre. As to what happens in Streak&#39;s fics... Well, I wouldn&#39;t write clop. I don&#39;t hate them, but I&#39;m not one of them either.<br><br> I don&#39;t mind telling you I double and even triple check my work. I like to be thorough and ensure my writing isn&#39;t straying into badfic. Joe, you know I love the fandom. I love all my fandoms. I wouldn&#39;t do anything I know would be bad for it. It&#39;s like I said. Split-personality monster/good person can be good. Streak had a good foundation, but then he screwed up the roof and walls. He has the potential to write some truly good fanfiction, and he&#39;s ignoring it in favor of clop. He frustrates me so.<br><br> Believe me, I could do it. It would take a long time, and I would have to place each and every thread of the huge, complex web one at a time and with absolute precision, lest it should fall apart. But I could do it. I&#39;m not as foolish as I seem. I may appear to be special with a capital &quot;R&quot;, but there&#39;s more to me. I&#39;m hurt that you&#39;d expect mindless clop and gore from me, actually! I may be absolutely in love with Fluttershy, but love/romance does not equal sex. The attraction is psychological, not physical. And that is the key reason that I&#39;m not a clopficcer. And I&#39;ve never been big on blood and gore unless it was originally a Sue.<br><br> I won&#39;t try it, though. Not yet. Not until I have a more solid handle on writing the characters myself and have had a chance to really put it all together. No, I think I&#39;ll stick with my little oneshots for now...</p>

            <p>In the show, we have not seen any violent or homicidal (or should it be ponycidal?) tendencies in Celestia, nor has it ever been hinted that she hides a sinister side. She is shown to be a responsible and caring leader and I just can&#39;t see her plotting the murder of several of her subjects. To address your points:<br><br>Concerning the princess&#39; immortality: I think she&#39;s able to overcome the sadness associated with losing friends though outliving them. Besides, the show isn&#39;t about death, it&#39;s about friendship. <br><br>Need I remind you that she did make amends with Luna by the second episode of the series? That&#39;s a massive load off her shoulders.<br><br>There are plenty of people in positions of power that aren&#39;t insane. I&#39;m not saying that ruling a country isn&#39;t stressful, but just think about this: how many presidents/prime ministers/kings/queens/big cheeses have snapped under pressure and personally plotted the murder of their people?<br><br>In short, grimdark or clop stories don&#39;t mesh at all with the show&#39;s original messages or values.</p>

            <p>You make good points. But, remember, ponycidal tendencies could be locked away with magic as the Molestia side was.<br><br> Celestia is a good, capable leader, yes. But... Ooh, there&#39;s another idea. Remember King George? He use to be great. Then, he took a blow to the head and he was never quite the same. Went totally insane. Became very violent. But also absolutely stupid, so there goes any &quot;clever&quot; plotting.<br><br> I can&#39;t think of any specific examples, but I&#39;m sure plenty have snapped. Not necessarily violently. Sometimes people just give out, I guess.<br><br> Well, not easily. I know one man who could do it, but he probably wouldn&#39;t have the time. He&#39;s more of a Redwaller anyway. But it&#39;s not a project for me, and I&#39;m starting to see why. Thanks for bringing me around. I wasn&#39;t quite in my right mind when I said all that. Well, less in it than I usually am.

            <p>Alright, so the the story I shall ask a question about is called <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7585262/1/NARUTO_VEANGANCE_REVELAITONS_3rd_Repost">Naruto Veangance Revelaitons</a>. It is awful, horrible, perhaps the worst fic I have ever read. It is the  My Immortal of the Naruto fandom. It star Ronan Beelzub as he moves to Konoha, blurts out long author tracts disguised as dialogue and has sex with every female in the series. Yes, every single one.This goes on for 69 chapters, so you at least have to give him credit for perseverance. <br>But, like the light at them end of the extremely disturbing and badly spelled tunnel, chapter 70 comes.In it, his step brother, Benji, who the author has whined about constantly actually writes an extended ending in which the Stu is killed and the world is set back to rights by a Stu hunter called Edfred and the canon characters.<br>My question: What should be done to this fic? Because I really want to either MST or spork it, but it was kind of already sporked in the actual story. Or should the last chapter not count as part of the actual fic?</p>

            <p>&quot;7. One thing to remember when sending in a report: &#39;Do not meddle in the affairs of assassins, for they are heavily armed and quick to anger. And not noticeably subtle.&#39; Send your reports in when you have at least a few plotholes between yourself and any agents intended to receive your missive with mission specs.

            <p>I&#39;ve been reading a few fics essentially at random, trying to find one to use for my first mission, and they&#39;ve thrown up a few questions about the creation of minis:<br><br>1) What if a character deliberately mispronounces another character&#39;s name, in order to wind them up or something? I know that for &quot;Every name spelled wrong in &#39;Rings&#39;, a mini-Balrog gets its wings&quot;, but does it still count if it&#39;s not actually a typo?<br><br>2) Is a mini created if the only mistake is a lack of capitalisation? I guess it probably should have some effect, but I&#39;m not sure if it is considered enough to invoke a mini. <br><br>3) Following on from 2, I&#39;ve spotted OCs using nouns for names, sometimes lacking in capitalisation. If an OC is called &#39;Rain&#39; for example, then the sentences &#39;Rain fell down...&#39; and &#39;rain fell down...&#39; will obviously be interpreted differently in the Word Worlds, but I&#39;m just curious as to whether you more experienced and knowledgeable people think that the second case should cause it to start randomly raining, or have a mini-Sue appear. <br><br>I&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts.<br><br>Apologies if any of these have been covered before, but I’ve had a look on the wiki and couldn’t find anything addressing those points specifically. <br></p>

            <p>Yes, I am indeed an Old Kingdom fan; I think the stories are fantastic and I really love how unique the setting is, but most of all I love the concept of the Abhorsen. <br><br>I&#39;ve always thought it a bit odd that in most typical generic fantasy settings (most of which I&#39;ve encountered are games that seem to have their roots in early editions of D&amp;D, but there have been a few books as well), necromancers are universally reviled as evil, but the heroes are quite happy to take a resurrection spell whenever they need it. I know the term &#39;necromancer&#39; actually has more to do with communicating with the dead rather than necessarily raising them, but it seems to be that second part that necromancers in fiction concentrate on. And &#39;resurrection&#39; and &#39;raise dead&#39; always seemed like they had a lot in common to me, despite being associated with opposite ends of the moral spectrum. I actually have a vaguely half-defined idea for a fantasy setting where all the best healers are actually necromancers, but currently have no plot for it. <br><br>That ended up going slighty more off topic at the end there than I&#39;d originally intended, oh well.</p>

            <p>I guess that the most important things regarding point 3 are to make it funny/entertaining, and maintain consistency with myself? So if I have both happen the first time that (admittedly rather specific) circumstance shows up, that&#39;s how I should always play it, rather than just making it up on the spot.  <br><br>I think I&#39;d be tempted to have my agents be unsure of what to expect, at least the first time it happens.

            <p>The writing itself is king (or queen), of course.  Whatever keeps the flow of the story moving in the most entertaining way is the option you should take, and that might not always be the same option.  The example you used happened to cause two things that worked together well, leading a to a mini-Sue battle under a stormy sky.<br><br>(Yo, dawg, we heard you liked rain, so we put some rain in yo rain so you can fight rain in the rain.)<br><br>But sometimes you might have to give up one or the other to keep the story moving along.  If Batman got misspelled Ratman, it would probably be funniest to just focus on the rat-themed super hero (or villain?) created by that, and not bog the scene down with a mini-whatever-gets-decided-on-in-the-post-up-above.  (That mini should still be listed on the appropriate wiki page afterwords for anyone who wants to adopt it.)<br><br>Anyone disagree?</p>

            <p>It all depends. I&#39;m actually no more sure on the first point than you are- its something I&#39;ve never seen before.<br><br>On the second point, it is if its the lack of capitalization of a name. Improper punctuation (see the various Middle-earths) can also cause minis.<br><br>On the third point, that all depends on what the author of that mission wants to do.

            <p>Uh, no. Kyubey DOES take the form of a cat-rabbit-ferret thing, it&#39;s just there&#39;s a ton of him.

            <p>Neuralyzing hive-minds is considered to be nearly impossible - it is even said that any powerful enough hive-mind discovering the PPC would cause an Emergency. Then again, as it has been already said, QB would probably find the PPC useful.<br><br>About getting rid of QB, the plan is simple:<br><br>- Kill one with sniper rifle. (PSG-1 or SVD recommended. M82A1 if he is discovered to be resilient to gunfire)<br>- Wait for another one to teleport in.<br>- Kill that one too.<br>- Rinse and repeat.<br><br>In the eventuality that QB discovers the plan and a swarm of them starts chasing you, use of rapid-fire shotguns (AA-12, Pancor Jackhammer, Saiga 12) is recommended.<br>If he turns the Puella Magi against you, knock them out with tranquilizer guns first (M9 from Metal Gear Solid 2 recommended. MGS3&#39;s Mosing Nagant if they are distant.)<br><br>As Team Fortress 2&#39;s Sniper would say, prioritize you targets, be efficient, and have a plan to kill everyone you meet.</p>

            <p>But there&#39;s an unlimited number of Kyubeys.

            <p>Hm... Well, Homura basically stole the entire Japanese military. It would not surprise me if she tried your exact plan at some point. But still, the basic problem with your plan is that no matter what you do, Kyubey can either a) make a new body, which he apparently can do an unlimited number of times, or b) just go to a different continent. And considering the whole meat-puppet thing, I have no idea if the Puella can be affected by any tranqs. All things considered, did they NEED to eat, sleep, or anything? <br><br>Also, I think that if Kyubey was ever replaced, I don&#39;t think it would be able to respawn unless that ability was ever shown off in the fic.

            <p>Well, if he could just eat the grief as it accumulates, then yes, it would be slower than the &#39;fall into despair, become witch, get defeated, eat the grief seed once it&#39;s been used up by a Puella&#39; but it might be more efficient, since you can keep eating despair as a Puella Magi continues to live, so with, say, Sayaka, who didn&#39;t even last a month, he could have  a) eaten the despair after she had become a witch and died, therefore getting rid of a producer of energy, or b) eat her despair directly from the soul gem, which means there&#39;d be less amounts per eating, but she&#39;d last much longer and therefore produce more grief total. </p>

            <p>Well, yes, but what I meant was that in broader terms Oktavia could potentially have netted him exponentially more grief from innumerable Puella Magi than he could possibly have gotten from just one, if Kyouko and Homura hadn&#39;t beat her up before she could eat anyone and bud off familiars.<br><br>Alternately, there&#39;s a theory that he wanted Sayaka out of the way in order to decrease the number of people available to fight Walpurgisnacht, in which case he was just being himself and not mentioning important details like, &quot;I can clear that thing up for you, y&#39;know.&quot; This way, he got rid of two of the remaining three Puella Magi in the area in one stroke by misleading Kyouko into thinking it was possible to save Sayaka.<br><br>Alternately alternately, maybe he&#39;s familiar enough with Puella Magi who decide they want to be heroes of justice that he figures it&#39;s not worth trying to string her along, because she&#39;ll probably just get herself killed if she continues and her witchification is more profitable to him than her death.<br><br>Alternately alternately alternately, whoever writes the manga is not Gen Urobochi, and the two of them have different ideas about how it should work. ;)<br><br>[/wild mass guessing]</p>

            <p>Strangely, I can&#39;t remember if I have ever had PPC dreams, but I feel like I did. I don&#39;t normally remember dreams, but the ones I do remember are weird. The sanest, most recent one involved a bunch of teenage genius-girls trying to get to the moon, in a space-ship that had a bomb thrown in through the window. Somehow, replacing the shards of glass kept the bomb from exploding. And there was a sort of bean-shaped air-kayak thing... my subconscious can get really weird sometimes.</p>

            <p>Alright, here we go. Time for (hopefully) my moment of triumph :)<br><br>Name: Percy<br><br>Age:17<br><br>Height: 6’4”<br><br>Species: Humanish<br><br>Home Continuum: Original story<br><br>Lust Objects: Master Chief, Tali (list ongoing)<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Fandoms: Spyro the Dragon, Halo, Mass Effect, AVP, Adventure Time, MLP, Fallout, Elder Scrolls (so far)<br><br>Weapon(s):  M6G Magnum.<br><br>Percy was a character from an original story that was scrapped in its early stages. In his home continuum, humans had decided that genetic manipulation was the next big social craze(right up there next to facebook and skinny jeans). Due to this, future generations were born with these traits, leading to the whole human race becoming not so human. With these changes came diseases, one of which affected Percy since he was born and would later be the catalyst in his unique appearance. He suffers from an advanced form of Bi-Polar disorder, dubbed Jekyll and Hyde syndrome in his homeverse, which affects the mental as well as the physical characteristics of the sufferer. Most sufferers do not live more than an average of 25 years, as the strain from the changes deteriorates their body and mind and leaves scars, and so Percy’s parents made use of a highly illegal attempt at a cure. In the process the features he sports today occurred, an unexpected reaction to the treatment. His condition is active, it is just stabilized, and In other words it won’t kill him. He is a relaxed and generally outgoing person and instead of getting angry, he just gets pitiful and whiny. Unless, he is pushed to breaking point. Slightly cowardly, he is still loyal to his friends.<br><br>He chooses to be purposely oblivious as he believes the world is far more exciting when you can’t see it coming. This has led to a few arguments with his partner and best friend, Vorce. He is also fairly intelligent in areas that he enjoys and is not stupid, even if he acts like it. He found his way to the PPC after his word world began collapsing around him, as he was the main character in the story, from a lack of storyline and plot. As the world collapses, Percy and Vorce began to argue over the best thing to do and as they argued, fell through a plothole. After stumbling through the multiverse and several badfics, they fell into HQ where they were initially separated until meeting once again at the office of the Marquis De Sod.<br><br><br>Name: Vorce<br><br>Age:17<br><br>Height: 5’6”<br><br>Species: Humanish/Bunnyboy<br><br>Home continuum: Original story<br><br>Lust Objects: Unknown<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Fandoms: Mass Effect, Discworld, JSRF, MLP, Oddworld, Elder Scrolls,  9<br><br>Weapons: Nothing so far.<br><br>Vorce was a character in an original story that was created to be Percy’s friend. However, he was given very little personality beyond being grumpy or easily angered, this means he is constantly one of these two until his personality properly develops, he is slowly improving.  He met Percy when being attacked by a group of street punks. Percy accidentally wandered in without noticing and got beat up as well. This led to them helping each other back to Vorce’s place, where they became friends, Percy’s unique view on life capturing Vorce’s curiosity. They weren’t without their pitfalls however, when the story began to collapse, arguing broke out and things got physical, causing them to fall through a plothole. Adventures through the multiverse ensued.<br><br>He is a grumpy individual that is desperate for change in his personality. This leads to frustration when at people he cares about for no reason other than he can’t help it. He is a genuinely caring person, he just can’t show it. He also respects authority even if he doesn’t agree or like them, this won’t stop him from breaking rules if his friends are involved.  Some tension still resides between him and Percy around their argument leading to falling through a plothole, but neither will say what it was about. While still a steadfast friend, he sometimes questions if he is truly doing the right thing by standing by Percy.<br><br>Vorce is not one to hold back the truth, even when the bluntness of his comments will hurt someone. He is very opinionated and will strongly defend what he believes in and cares about. This makes him a sort of double-edged blade, he will defend you vehemently, but might also condemn you just as strongly. <br><br>Permission Piece: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Es4GMzqhKAF_lKGOy3ZBHmx1AQ6RISAbelpjFIJKJr0/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Es4GMzqhKAF_lKGOy3ZBHmx1AQ6RISAbelpjFIJKJr0/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Es4GMzqhKAF_lKGOy3ZBHmx1AQ6RISAbelpjFIJKJr0/edit</a></a><br><br></p>

            <p>Alright... You&#39;ve got some ongoing punctuation issues that I sort of remember pointing out last time - and you don&#39;t seem to have changed your writing sample or agents much from the last time you applied. I still have some issues with your characterization of Luxury. I&#39;d also like to see a more detailed description of Vorce&#39;s personality - he obviously has more going on than &#39;grumpy and stubborn&#39; in your writing sample. (Which is good! Just, go into that.)<br><br>I&#39;m just a bit concerned at the fact that you didn&#39;t really seem to change much about your writing sample from the last time I saw it. If you&#39;d like to go over it in more detail, I&#39;ll be happy to add some comments in a pm or e-mail. However, for now, I&#39;m going to say no to this particular request-- you are, of course, welcome to reapply. I&#39;d just like to see more careful proofreading in the grammar, and a bit more attention to your agents&#39; backgrounds.<br><br>(I should point out, as an aside, that I <i>strongly</i> advise you to either call Percy&#39;s disease something else, or do some research on Bipolar Disorder. (Among other things, Jekyll and Hyde alludes, however faintly, more to Split or Multiple Personality Disorder than Bipolar.) Bipolar folk aren&#39;t Jekyll and Hyde, and we&#39;re not unstable people who suffer constant mood whiplash.)</p>

            <p>... with, I hasten to add (although the thought of letting you all think an All-Out PG Brawl was coming was <i>very</i> tempting) consultation with VM.<br><br>So, permission granted, with the following provisos:<br><br>-Make sure your characters are fully-realised and not constrained by their summaries. I noticed that Percy&#39;s J&amp;H didn&#39;t really impact on the sample, and I approve - the idea of not instantly using every idea you have is a very tricky one to master. But make sure you also continue to let your characters grow - their initial summaries are not their be-all and end-all. Agent Dafydd wasn&#39;t originally an elf, let alone... everything else. :P (This is more by way of advice than a proviso)<br><br>-Don&#39;t say bipolar. Very simple request, that. It has the potential to make some people uncomfortable, and, well, it&#39;s unnecessary. It&#39;d be okay in a lecture/essay on J&amp;H Syndrome (if it&#39;s an actual modified form rather than supposed to be just a serious case - I&#39;m thinking the OCD-type disorder in the Ender&#39;s Game books, here), but as a general identifier, go with the interesting-sounding J&amp;H - or something else - rather than bipolar.<br><br>-And the real proviso: write your first story, get it <b>thoroughly</b> beta&#39;d... and then please send it to me, Huinesoron, before publishing. VM&#39;s concern is that your betas aren&#39;t doing quite as good a job as is needed, and I want to see that that&#39;s changed. I <i>don&#39;t</i> want you to hand me something that still needs editing - I want to be able to simply email back &#39;Good job - go ahead&#39;. My email should be shown above.<br><br>So congratulations! Welcome to the shared universe of the PPC. Please don&#39;t break our toys - we&#39;ve all been through a lot together.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That&#39;s... wow. Well, thank you all so much! Especially the people willingly to go through my story in the first place :p<br><br>And about the provisos. I probably could have made it clearer with a few of them, such as Percy&#39;s J&amp;H and Vorce&#39;s lack of a true personality, and how I had already planned how it would affect them in later stories. I never planned on having anything to do with J&amp;H come up until quite a few missions in.<br><br>I also apologize about the bipolar thing, It was just as an example, as I would have always used J&amp;H when refering to it. Turns out bipolar was wrong to begin with, so sorry.<br><br>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be sure to do that.

            <p>A friend and I are going to visit Chicago for a couple days in late June to see the MythBusters exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry.

            <p>As July noted, Neshomeh and I live in Chicago.<br><br>As far as how to get to the Museum, a car is probably your best bet.  The Metra trains pretty much all go into Union Station, and none of them really go near the Museum, as far as I know.  If you took Metra, you&#39;d have to switch over to another, more local train and then a bus.<br><br>As for the Museum itself, everything they do there is ridiculously awesome.  Do everything.<br><br>On a side note: the Chicago Public Library rents out passes that are good for up to four people.  They let you in for free, with the exception of special tours and whatnot which have the usual costs.  Still, great value.  You&#39;d just need to have someone with a CPL card to get the pass for you.<br><br>But where would you find someone who could do that?  *cough cough*  &gt;.&gt;  (Translation: We love the MoSaI and would love to go with you, if you are interested.)</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m no PG, but I could give you some pointers.<br><br>First of all, yes, the &quot;spazzy fangirl&quot; aspect should really be taken down a couple of notches - we all enjoy a good discussion about our favorite fandoms and characters, but it could be a little too much for some people if it&#39;s taken to the extreme. You do not need to emphasize that you have an embarassing RP or use capslock in subject headers to show you&#39;re excited, if you catch my drift, Li&#39;l Pink Ranger =P<br><br>On the topic of Fanon, please do keep in mind that not everyone may know what you&#39;re referring to (as is the nature of most in-jokes), and that in most cases, we will refer to the canon instead of the fanon, as there can be many different kinds of fans and fanons of a franchise, some more extreme than the others. Please respect the fans who are not interested in fan theories.<br><br>Now, something that might sound less like scolding and finger-waggling is that you should probably read a couple of different PPCers&#39; spinoffs - TOS is a good place to start, but since then, a lot has changed in the PPC&#39;s own canon: New rules have been established, new characters have been introduced, new tools have been invented, and missions might be approached differently (depending on the author).<br><br>Your characters have really improved from the last attempts, so you might want to experiment with how they work together (you might want to play it out in a document you keep to yourself until you&#39;ve figured out where you want to take each of them in the sense of character arcs), and try to get a &quot;feel&quot; for them, so you can automatically recall how to write them - maybe you could even make your Permission piece something pertaining to how your agents met, or detailing the backstory of one of the two.<br><br>If you&#39;re successful and get Permission, please don&#39;t just jump at the first mission you encounter. Depending on the fanfic you target, you will need a lot of planning and perhaps even have to do some research into the canon. You can always try asking here or in the IRC for some advice if you get stuck, nobody will be mad at you if you aren&#39;t able to do your first mission all by yourself (and nobody really expects this from you, either - that&#39;s what a community is for!).<br><br>So just stick around for a while, talk, make some friends, and enjoy what the other PPCers have already written first.<br><br>I hope this helps you a little, and good luck on your next attempt - but please don&#39;t rush things and run your sample by a beta reader before posting it. We don&#39;t have deadlines, and while the above might sound a bit strict, we do want you to have fun doing this, after all! =D<br><br>(This Wall of Text was brought to you by Wall of Text, Inc.)</p>

            <p>*waves*<br><br>So, I dunno how many people here will remember me. I hung out here back in 2007/2008. Wrote a few missions, all in the Fullmetal Alchemist continuum. Then Real Life hit and I kinda dropped off the face of the earth.<br><br>In the past year, I&#39;ve become the beta for Karen Elaine DuLay&#39;s <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6795085/1/Official_Fanfiction_University_OFUATLA">Official Fanfiction University of Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>. Since that kinda makes me part of the Canon Protection Initiative again, I figured I should reintroduce myself here. OFUs and the PPC being somewhat related, I might have to ask for advice sometime.<br><br>Like, say, right now. I completely forget--are there any rules for creating new bleeproducts? Karen and I noticed that there&#39;s nothing along the lines of bleeprin and tea. Since tea is such a major part of the Avatarverse, we figured it&#39;d make sense if bleeptea was created at OFUA:TLA. Is that alright?<br><br>Anyways. I don&#39;t plan on writing any more missions, though I might work on some short stories with my agents or something if the right mood hits. I tend to spend my time writing actual fanfiction these days, though, so I probably won&#39;t write much about my agents. As far as I know, Singsong and Joyce are still serving the FMA-verse in the Department of Floaters. Brenden, I like to think, got a transfer to DOGA, where he can burn things to his heart&#39;s content with a new partner who is, quite probably, a pyromaniac G1 My Little Pony unicorn.<br><br>As for Anjilly Ka, she&#39;s retired from the PPC and is now a staff member at OFUA:TLA, where she spends much of her time headdesking and refraining from killing the students.<br><br>So, yes. If you remember me, hi! Good to see you again! And if you don&#39;t, hi! Nice to meet you! And if you&#39;re a Permission Giver or something of the sort, what do you think of bleeptea?</p>

            <p>This mission felt very lightweight to me. Normally, I wouldn&#39;t have much of a problem with this - not every mission can or should be a big dramatic production. Having a fic where the agents can metaphorically catch their breath and relax can help pace out a longer story arc, not to mention provide some good humor-centric moments.<br><br>What bothered me in this case was the pairing of a lightweight &quot;breather&quot; mission with some major character development with your agents. It doesn&#39;t feel like enough importance is being granted to the relationship upgrade between Ian and Lee. Coming from the opposite direction, the light romantic scenes feel somewhat out of place during a mission. <br><br>The culmination of the romantic buildup also feels a bit unrefined. I would say that it comes out of nowhere, but there is enough hinted at in this and previous stories to set it up. However, it doesn&#39;t feel like it was set up enough and the whole thing comes together without major conflict or tension.<br><br>I feel like this could have been greatly improved had the mission been separated from the romance and both given their own full stories. More focus could have been given to both, thus making both an entertaining mission and a character-driven romance in bloom. As it stands, however, the whole thing just feels too convenient to enjoy.</p>

            <p>As you mentioned: Dream of the Endless. For that matter, in Endless Nights it looks like it&#39;s made canon that Despair is responsible for a huge portion of DC canon.<br><br>Or take Terry Pratchett&#39;s <em>Thief of Time</em>. There&#39;s a total and outright reality-warping. Or Carrot Ironfoundersson--much less flashily (usually), but it&#39;s observed by many.<br><br>One could also argue that Amy Pond in Series 5 of New Who could. Another candidate is Corwin of Amber, though only in the end and hypothetically anyone <em>could</em> have--they just didn&#39;t, and that counts for a lot.<br><br>Adam from <em>Good Omens</em> may count--you notice the number of Gaiman and Pratchett works here.<br><br>Alcatraz from the series of the same name by Brandon Sanderson is the <em>currently</em> unique-power-type reality warper, though there have been others in the past. (Basically all his family can warp reality in different ways--he just has the single most egregious and no one else has it.)<br><br>Remember that &#39;fic&#39; is short for &#39;fiction.&#39; It&#39;s not just fans writing in already-published worlds. Just as it can be handled well in original fiction, so it can be in fan fiction. Most people can&#39;t handle either well, but that&#39;s the 90% rule at work.</p>

            <p>There are multiple Endless working at cross-purposes (and it&#39;s by Neil Gaiman), Lobsang/Jeremy doesn&#39;t do anything godlike until near the end, Amy&#39;s the <i>key</i> to universes but doesn&#39;t control reality outright, Amber is a &quot;crawling with gods&quot; example, and <i>Good Omens</i> falls under the Gaiman clause.

            <p>Four ponies based off of celebrities? Woooow. Most interesting OCs I have seen in a while. I think my favorite is Roux...

Lots going on, with the unexpected mid-mission point of view change and the mini-Discords getting the crash dummy.

The biggest annoyance was the capitalization fail, but nothing terribly bad happened to the Poniverse itself.  It made the assassination kind of sudden for me.  Maybe it just wasn&#39;t a very action-filled fic?<br><br>Also, you&#39;ve got a little production error here.  When Ian is summoning the celebrity!ponies to the stage, you say Pony!Al Roker is a pegasus.

            <p>For those of you who may not know, on March 1 I issued a friendly challenge to the Board: read old PPC stories, write reviews, and earn points! I&#39;ve been bollocks at counting said points due to work and various other things keeping me busy (last weekend I was in Ohio to watch my brother fence in the NCAA championship—<i>so cool</i>) but up through the 31st, you can still earn them!<br><br>The game is happening in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2514;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">this thread on the secondary Board</a>, and you can read up on all the rules and stuff there.<br><br>Work may keep me busy again this weekend, but hopefully things will quiet down for a little while afterward, so points will be tallied and a winner determined as soon as my head stops spinning. Also, I will never ever run a PPC challenge again when I know my company is about to announce service changes. &gt;.<br>~Neshomeh, your friendly neighborhood customer support.</p>

            <p>All right, so I have found a fanfic that I mean to mission. It involves a Character Replacement, who needs to be killed, but is about to fall into despair, which is a death sentence to Puella Magi, since it means they will turn into horrific monsters, and this particular fic makes the replaced character turn into the Queen of Witches, Walpurgisnacht, who is pretty much unbeatable. It is possible to stop the falling-into-despair with a Grief Seed, which is dropped by a witch after she is defeated. <br><br>So, my agents will need to semi-purify the replacement to keep her from destroying everything, so: Is it possible for Medical or DoSAT to make artificial Grief Seeds, that don&#39;t require the death of a young girl and can be safely  disposed in the canon? And, if the consensus is that it shouldn&#39;t be possible, what would be a good alternative?</p>

            <p>... but you&#39;re talking about a Character Replacement, so I&#39;m guessing this fall is something the real character wouldn&#39;t do?  Maybe your agents could try a modified exorcism; beating the replacement over the head with canon materials to make it act more like the real character.  Then, once it won&#39;t drop into despair (or pulls out of despair), kill it.</p>

            <p>Basically, Canon!Homura was slipping towards despair because despite all her efforts to save Madoka, all that happened was that the consequences of Madoka going witchy got more apocalyptic and Madoka herself got more passive and insecure. She <i>was</i> getting dangerously close to the edge during her battle with Walpurgisnacht, but I suspect she would have shot her Soul Gem rather than become a witch; despite what the Suethor says, she wants to protect Madoka, and creating a time-traveling magical psycho-stalker would <i>not</i> be a good way to do that.</p>

            <p>It&#39;d be worse than Sakhmet Black and that one who possessed Arda put together. ._.  Could you find a pre-existing Grief Seed? Like, say, &quot;borrow&quot; one from someone canonical or grab one dropped by a familiar or something? Or if the fic mentioned one that didn&#39;t get brought up again, maybe an agent could nick it once the narrative forgot it existed?</p>

            <p>No, the fic is a one-shot. It&#39;s basically, what if Madoka DIDN&quot;T leave the shelter on the night of the storm? Well, according to the fic, Homura would start hating Madoka and turn into a witch to spite her (not even using the CANONCICALLY GIVEN REASON that she would realize that she&#39;s only been making everything worse) There&#39;s no familiar battles, and no witches other than Walpurgis. </p>

            <p>That is... astonishingly stupid. :/<br><br>Another idea: wouldn&#39;t the real Homura probably have some Grief Seeds with her? I bet Kyubei ate the ones Sayaka was refusing to use, but it seems unlike Homerun-chan not to have <i>some</i> in that Hammerspace buckler of hers. And I can&#39;t remember- did we ever find out what happened to Oktavia&#39;s Grief Seed? &#39;cause if it&#39;s still lying around, that seems like it also might be a possibility. *random ideas*</p>

            <p>Perhaps PPC agents are <i>why</i> Oktavia&#39;s Seed is MIA?

            <p>I have a first-printing &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; for AD&amp;D -- the edition with the Cthulhu, Nehwon, and Melnibonean mythoi (that TSR didn&#39;t exactly have the rights to use).  I&#39;ve <em>seen</em> powergamer groups decide to rack up plenty of experience points by chanting &quot;Hastur&quot; until he showed up.<br><br>But that&#39;s just one set of numbers vs another.  The reality (if that&#39;s the right word) <em>should</em> be far more impressive.  And from my admittedly limited reading, Cthulhu isn&#39;t an idiot -- if he starts actually taking damage from a given set of puny mortals, he&#39;s not hanging around to let them finish destroying his current extension into 3-D space.</p>

            <p>Er, the point about Kriemhild Gretchen and Walpurgisnacht is this: Walpurgisnacht is almost unkillable. In the end, the only thing that CAN defeat it is a major overwriting of reality that erases the witches themselves from time. Kriemhild Gretchen--well, let&#39;s say this. Witches, going by Sayaka, tend to be a bit stronger than their Puella Magi originals. Kriemhild Gretchen came from Madoka, who essentially made a wish to overwrite reality, transcend cause-and-effect, erase herself from existence, and become a goddess/one of the underlying forces of reality/the concept of Hope itself. And Walpurgisnacht KEEPS GETTING STRONGER. And she can manifest without a barrier, and when she first showed up on the radar in episode 11, everyone thought she was a freak supercell. Also, Homura can&#39;t turn into WPN because Homura&#39;s witch form is called Homulilly (revealed in the game.) And making WPN hibernate would break canon, so...  Yeah, the best bet is finding a Grief Seed or having a DoSAT replacement.</p>

            <p>Well, they use &#39;grief cubes&#39; that are dropped by demons. As I understand  when Madoka saves a Puella, then all the darkness in their Gem is sort of released into the universe. Eventually it will collect into a lump of grief that takes the form of the demons, who will eat despairing humans like the witches did. When demons die, then they drop a couple cubes, which can be used to recharge the Soul Gem. I imagine that if a Puella in the PPC turns their gem completely black, Madokami will appear, since, you know, she wished to be in every world. <br><br>Hmm... How does this sound: Once DoSAT gets ahold of a Grief Seed, they can create an artificial holder (a Grief Sphere?) that, when filled up, can be tossed into Madoka, where the despair will release itself into the general universe. No Incubators or battles needed.</p>

            <p>In the first set of timelines, it was in the Incubators&#39; interest to be deceptive and allow at least a significant portion of Puella Magi to fall into despair, since witches can snowball the amount of power available. Post-rewrite, it&#39;s in their interest to keep as many Puella Magi alive and fighting as possible, since now a despairing Puella is a straight-up loss. Consequently, Kyubei goes from fluffy Mephistopheles to an adorable, sociopathically rational ally.</p>

            <p>The way you handled the actions of the grill had me laughing several times while reading, and I never thought I&#39;d consider the Buster Sword from FFVII to be relatively reasonably sized!  <br><br>I also thought the Department of Finance was an inspired choice for Stan to go to. I have thought about having one of my agents (if/when I actually get around to requesting permission) having a bit of a feud with Finance over his expenses or something. The idea of an agent storming up there, ready to kick some ass over &#39;those damn forms&#39; and then seeing a Predator sat behind the desk... yeah, I&#39;ve got to do something with that. <br><br>There was just one bit where the wording seemed kind of clunky; &#39;Somehow, the sentient grill was not deterred by the fact that its blade had suddenly grown to a length of approximately three miles and three quarters of another one while also getting much thicker so that the blade did not instantly snap from its own length .&#39; - I think it would read smoother if the length was described as &#39;approximately three and three quarter miles&#39;. The rest of it read well, but I just sort of stumbled over that one sentence. <br><br>Having said that, I thought the mission was brilliant, and while I haven&#39;t read any of the other missions featuring Xanatus, Anneli and Cinderlla, I will certainly be doing so in the near future. And only partly out of morbid curiosity over what they could possibly have done to get assigned 3 trollfics in a row. </p>

            <p>Yeah, this mission was a crazy one. I got to do some crazy things with this one.<br><br>LOL yeah, that was inspired by a random IRC chat that I had while I was conceiving this sporking, so... Yeah. But now that you mention it, that would be hilarious.<br><br>Ah. Thank you. I&#39;ll keep an eye out for that kind of thing. Thank you for pointing that out!<br><br>Thanks! Be sure to check out Florestan and Eusabius&#39; RC too, as I also write that. And beware when you get to the mission before they get assigned three trollfics in a row: aside from being a more serious mission in tone, that mission also doubles as what I&#39;m fairly certain is the longest PPC mission ever written.</p>

            <p>I really liked how you managed to capture the insanity of the entire thing with things like the animated barbeque grill, golems smoking joints and the four-mile sword (a pity it didn&#39;t persist after the troll&#39;s passing, it would have made one heck of a trophy). <br><br>If there is one thing that I think didn&#39;t mesh really well with your story is the fact that Anneli managed to check her iPhone in Ferelden.

            <p>Yeah, this fic just had too many great opportunities to create some wonderfully surreal imagery. I think the only other time I had such great imagery to work with was in my failed collab with someone else that hasn&#39;t gone anywhere.<br><br>When she does check her iPhone in a fantasy continuum, it won&#39;t work nearly as well as it did here.

O.O I guess it could work... But Turkey&#39;s, like, 25 and Lili&#39;s, like, 14. *just a BIT scary* I like her better with Latvia, honestly, she&#39;s sweet enough to help him with his Eastern European Soap Opera-ness and they&#39;re about the same age.

Lecture = NOT the best time to watch funny Hetalia vids.<br><br>Ohhh, yes. *anti-lustined as well* And America being tsundere to ENGLAND.<br><br>Ah. Well... &gt;////&gt; I indulge in a bit of OOC RP as well. OOC to Hetalia canon, not to history. &gt;/////&gt; For example... my Iggy has a split personality. Most of the time, he is lovely, tsundere, Shakespeare-quoting, and as IC as I can make him. But if Really Bad Things happen to the people he loves... America, France, Sealand, or the Commonwealth nations- he goes into Jack the Ripper mode and starts killing people. *has complicated, historical fanon explaining this*<br><br>Hehehehe... Lovecraft is lovely. I&#39;ve written a few things inspired by his work... </p>

            <p>Ehehe, OOC is always fun~ When it&#39;s not annoying the crap out of people~<br>Somehow, I make my own RP OCs OOC... Try and make a <i>#MagnificentBastard</i> and end up with a giggly type who&#39;s into Floriography. Although floriography is awesome.<br>I mean, grass represents homosexual love. XD<br><br>It isn&#39;t really Hetalia, but imagining Germany&#39;s reaction to Dennis Egel... is hilarious. XD<br><br>Tsunderes in general... &gt;///<br>I tend to prefer OCs for RPing... people don&#39;t know when they&#39;re OOC~ But generally, my only Hetalia one (Wales) fits the history and stuff, so yay~<br>Jack the Ripper mode... XD<br><br>...I created a magical spell list, with spells based on that confusing, impossible-to-pronounce language. XD</p>

            <p>Hehehehe... Oh, yes. It depends on if it&#39;s OOC as in &#39;something the character might do&#39; (My Iggy quotes Shakespeare, my BFF&#39;s Prussia has a thing for Transformers) or something they&#39;d NEVER do (America passing up an opportunity to be the HERO.)<br><br>Ehh, it&#39;s more about them telling you who they&#39;re supposed to be. I had a character who was in the closet about everything that made him interesting- and I DON&#39;T just mean his sexuality. Once he finally admitted to me that yes, he was a HUGE comic book geek, yes, he WAS a huge geek in general, yes, his favorite bands were Scorpions and Guns n&#39; Roses, yes, he WAS bisexual, yes, he DID have a crush on his arch-rival... he became MUCH more interesting.<br><br>Nice! Didn&#39;t know that. *imagining Baby!America giving Iggy a bouquet of grass and dandelions and Iggy thinking France put him up to it*<br><br>Heh, ohhhh yes. Or Prussia&#39;s reaction to &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot;. <br><br>Welsh is LOVE. The Black Cauldron and the Dark is Rising books got me into it... ~</p>

            <p>Aha, I&#39;m reminded of those Facebook likes that say &#39;If I get 10000 likes I will name my first-born Megatron&#39; and the like.<br>...my username shows my love for a certain character... But &#39;Himochi&#39; is a nickname of his nickname... ^^&#39;<br><br>:D Ah, well, our RP has this whole giant storyline with family feuds and backstabbing and all sorts thrown in...<br>The one I was talking about is called Zíma. I tend to give the characters in her village-type-thing Czech surnames... as first names... ^^&#39;<br>She&#39;s slightly psychotic and quite a loner, but she has a soft side that she shows to barely anyone... And the can manipulate water and ice. Which is quite a common ability for her people.<br>Her whole backstory is confusing... one of her brothers, Wentrcek, is obsessed with taking over the family and becoming the leader... so he killed their parents, the old leaders, but the other brother, Vlček, became leader instead... So now Wentrcek is trying to kill Vlček.<br>And somehow, Zíma was cast out of the family... I haven&#39;t decided why yet, aha~ ^^&#39;<br>She&#39;s kind of obsessed with nature and daylight and stuff... because where she came from, there was always a storm going on, so you could never see the sky or feel the sun. And no plants grew there other than the stuff they grew themselves in specially built houses.<br>TL;DR - Confusing~ XD<br><br>:3 I would, but I&#39;m s&#39;posed to be writing more of my crack fic...

            <p>So am I. It happens to the best of us, friend. <br><br>Well... *rambling because it&#39;s 8 AM here and I stayed up too late* Lorcan was created to be a villain, and he was supposed to be a cool, dashing, #MagnificentDastard. Supposed being the operative word there. He&#39;d told me he was a bit of a Gary-Stu-ish, assassin-y, cool guy. <br>Reality couldn&#39;t be farther than the truth. <br>He was actually... well, kind of lame. Part of it was, that though he was ambitious and tried REALLY HARD to get what he wanted, he had the WORST LUCK OF ANYONE IN THE MULTIVERSE. Part of it was that he had TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE taste in women, and kept getting these horrible gold-diggers pregnant. He has the worst hair in the universe- no matter what style he tries to make it, it looks HORRIBLE- and a big tat on his left bicep that looks like it was drawn in the dark. <br>He&#39;s in the closet about everything that makes him interesting... He&#39;s an #ArmoredClosetGay (ought to be bi, but his taste in women is so bad that his only meaningful relationships are with men), he&#39;s a SERIOUS closet geek (Alex, his boyfriend, is the only one who knows JUST how geeky he can get... mostly because he&#39;s been in the guy&#39;s bedroom, it&#39;s full of pr0n and comic books... xD), and he&#39;s HIGHLY tsundere. He can be freakin&#39; adorable when he wants to be, but usually he&#39;s too scared. His life&#39;s ambition is to be a pirate, or, failing that, to FINALLY beat the &#39;Down the Rabbit Hole&#39; level in Modern Warfare 3. <br><br>TL;DR: He&#39;s a dork pretending to be cool and I love him to pieces. XD<br><br>...They might. Especially Luna, I can see her having a bag full of Nargles. <br><br>Ohhhhhh... that&#39;s so much prettier than ours. ;~; Ours is all about some battle in the War of 1812 no one cares about. :P And it&#39;s to the tune of an old English drinking song. XD You can tell Alfred chose it, can&#39;t you?<br><br>Patriotism RULES.<br><br>*noms* Yay! Sugar! </p>

Pirate!England... Pirate!Spain... Pirate!France... *drools* *anti-lustin&#39;d*<br><br>...I have just realised how I never pointed out... Zíma&#39;s character changed quite a bit after she got engaged... ^^&#39;<br>She got less psychotic and just sorta became... a bit weak, really. Oops.<br>But seriously, she&#39;s engaged to this guy called Sid, and the storyline that goes with him is really complicated...<br>From what I can tell...<br>There&#39;s this family called the Fisher family, and the youngest, Cloud (his real name is Edward but he goes by Cloud), had overly strong powers but couldn&#39;t control them in the slightest. One accidental fire later, his family are dead. Now, then there&#39;s this other family, whose names I don&#39;t know. One of them (who I know by Chief, but you never know) is obsessed with getting into the basement of the burnt house, because that&#39;s where all of the family&#39;s wealth and knowledge is stored. But, the only one who can unlock it all is Cloud. Cloud himself is going out with a guy called Set, who is... kind of a bit of a d!(k.<br>Chief used to be the master of a guy called Sid, until Chief was killed by Set, and Sid swore that he&#39;d get revenge, saying he would kill both Set and Cloud. Somehow - I haven&#39;t worked out how yet - Chief came back to life, but changed. He&#39;s now more sadistic and evil...<br>Some stuff that I missed happened, and Sid ended up having to protect Cloud with Set, and... yeah, that&#39;s about all I can remember~ ^^&#39;<br>TL;DR: Information you didn&#39;t ask for. XD<br><br>*grins* So somehow Doctor Who is now gonna cross over with Harry Potter and Hetalia in my mind... ^^<br><br>*laughs and tuts* Such an &#39;Alfred&#39; thing to do... haha~<br>And it is quite pretty... It goes on about how beautiful our land is... land of hills, land of bards, land of... sheep? XD<br><br>Of course it does! *is surrounded by Welshness: sheep, a rugby ball, a harp, some leeks, some daffodils, more sheep, a dragon...*<br><br>*noms cookie* COOKIE!</p>

            <p>Heh. I&#39;ve had some relationships In Real Life, too. <br>...You&#39;re like, the opposite of me, then. I&#39;m bi.  &gt;///&gt; (Though not as big of a pain about it as Captain Jack... I hope... I&#39;m kind of in the closet about it In Real Life.)<br>Pirates are win. Hehehe... I see, I see. RP is fun. I do a LOT of Hetalia RP... Sometimes people even think I *am* a guy, because I run England a bunch.<br>Ohhhh... I always play Iggy as, like, a mix of all of them. Like, he&#39;s tragic like Ten, angry like Nine, and madcap like Eleven... while still being brilliant, like all of them.<br>Awesome. :D I&#39;d love to be Welsh. :)</p>

            <p>...hurray for no relationships!<br>Cool... one of my best (and only) friends is bi... And she&#39;s awesome, haha~ *Not <i>Prussian</i> awesome, obviously, but... ^^*<br><br>Why yes they are. The only thing cooler than Pirates of the Caribbean and Pirate!England... is the Hetalia parody of PotC.<br>The whole storyline ended up going to pot, but I&#39;m glad about that... =w=<br><br>I do quite a bit of Hetalia RP too... mostly with my Wales, really, although I did an RP on Omegle where I was England... it was fun to RP someone I usually can&#39;t. ^^<br>...I didn&#39;t see Nine as <i>that</i> angry... He was awesome though.<br>Then again, my memories may be screwy because I watched The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances over and over and more or less forgot half of the other episodes.
