            <p>Ok, so I should really say hello and a littler bit about myself. I&#39;m an artist role player model maker jewellery student who turns his hand to anything that takes his interest. And my intrestest is easily taken. Think the kind of person who chases after shinies. Then draws them. And is then distracted by pigeons. And draws them. <br><br>Kinda rambling a bit. <br><br>Long story short, Hi!</p>

            <p>Welcome (somewhat belatedly) to the PPC! Since I&#39;m pretty sure that everyone else has said whatever needs to be said, I&#39;ll skip most of my spiel. Anyway, have an incredibly shiny hat! It&#39;s wonderfully distracting and has many small bits that make noises. It&#39;s great if you don&#39;t want people to pay attention to the rest of your body. You probably shouldn&#39;t wear it if you need to concentrate on something though.</p>

            <p>Actually it&#39;s from the battle tech universe. Ive been playing their mechshatever series since I was a kid, and one of the mechs, the best one in my opinion, was the Thor class clan battle mech.<br>Incidentally, this series has particle projection cannons, which shortens to PPC. Just a bit of trivia.<br><br>Fandoms... Ok, never been much into western comics, marvel or dc, but I read a lot of web comics and manga, probably favourites are freefall and girl genius for web comics, and orange marmalade and kenichi for manga. I read disc world. In fact I have every book I could get my hands on. I might be missing perhaps two, but it&#39;s possible I just can&#39;t find them. I love lord of the rings, and trudi caravan and Charlie bone and possibly my favourite written works are by Alastair Reynolds. I started the mortal engines series about age ten, and the original four books I once read in a day.  I love stories, and hunt them out like peanuts. You suddenly realise you&#39;re eating them by the handful, and it&#39;s kinda unhealthy. Also, finished every fiction book in my school library a couple years ago that I could stand to read and now I&#39;m considering trying to finish the sci if section of the local one. And now this post seems a little long.</p>

            <p>I prefer books being like potato chips. :D Mostly because I don&#39;t actually like peanuts.<br><br>I haven&#39;t finished reading Girl Genius... I got distracted years ago and now I can&#39;t get back in from the start because it&#39;s not quite amazing enough that I can just reread it whenever.<br><br>Discworld... oh lordie love Discworld. You will be in good company so long as you don&#39;t tell me about anything that&#39;s happened in books other than... Wintersmith, Soul Music, ummm... Guards! Guards, yeah I think that&#39;s it. And I have Feet of Clay and The Truth out from the library, so especially no spoilers from those.<br><br>Lord of the Rings. Very good company. Have you read any of the Silm.? I&#39;ve only got to about page 40 and also I lost my copy so I&#39;m stuck there. It&#39;s amazingly dense but the prose is <i>incredible</i>, though that&#39;s only to be expected seeing as Tolkien was a linguist and such.<br><br>Turn off your autocorrect, it can go hang if it misspells Discworld or sci-fi.<br><br>P.S.: <u>S</u>pelling, <u>p</u>unctuation, <u>a</u>nd <u>g</u>rammar are our friends. I think capitalization either falls under grammar or really needs to be added into the acronym.</p>

            <p>I prefer to think that certain books are potato chips - not particularly good for you, but salty and you end up eating a lot of them at once, but some books are like granola bars. They&#39;re better for you to snack on but occasionally the chewing isn&#39;t what you&#39;re up to that day. Like... House of Night, for example, I consider to be a book series that is a  bag of potato chips. They&#39;re fun to munch but I get a headache if I eat too many of them. And now I&#39;ve killed the metaphor.<br><br>I&#39;ve beaten my auto-correct into submission, mostly. It&#39;s doable! Of course, I used a blunt-force metaphor, which may not be everyone&#39;s weapon of choice.<br><br>I agree on Girl Genius - I would not start over completely, but I&#39;ll happily get caught up to several week&#39;s worth of updates in one fell swoop. Now, if only Order of the Stick would update more often, I&#39;d almost never lack for a way to kill five minutes.</p>

            <p>So, the mission Sergio Turbo and I are doing right now involves a lot of OC&#39;s and character replacements. At this time, I only have ideas with what to do with one of them. Is it OK if I recruit some of them anyways and then put them up for adoption here?<br><br>Second question: I have only seen a few episodes, out of order, of Sailor Moon. Can someone tell me what the effect of Sailor Saturn&#39;s attack, Death Reborn Revolution, is? I know it kills her, but I&#39;m not sure what the actual effect is.</p>

<li>I guess so, if they&#39;re not putrid enough to warrant execution. You&#39;ll have to talk to one of the older posters about that, I think.<br>2. According to the Sailor Moon Wiki, Death Reborn Revolution calls forth a large amount of ribbons, which wrap around Sailor Saturn, and slice up the unfortunate target of the attack, while apparently draining the target&#39;s power with &quot;negative energy&quot;. In addition, a tremendous amount of energy is released from the ground, enough to destroy the ruins of Mugen Gakuen, and reach the Tau Nebula. The attack is sufficiently powerful to destroy one of the primary antagonists of the series, the aspect of Chaos known as Pharaoh 90.<br>Link to Wiki page: <a href="http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Reborn_Revolution"><a href="http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Reborn_Revolution">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Reborn_Revolution</a></a><br>3.

            <p>...I almost died laughing when I read &#39;Aura&#39; - comes of playing games where auras are real enchantments, then reading it as a misspelling in /that/ context.

            <p>Um... hi! *meep* I&#39;m Constellation, or as many people prefer, Constel. &quot;Geek, writer, LARPer, fanatic&quot;, as I often say about myself, plus many other seasonal things (currently a film director). I&#39;ve known about PPC for quite a few years now, but it sure took me time to pluck up enough courage to actually show up here. Fandoms (as they seem to be good to list up everywhere in the Internet) are many, main three being Doctor Who (the newest), Lord of the Rings (the oldest), and Sherlock Holmes (the most influencing). Add almost any crime series/novel that exists. Addicted to Internet and chocolate, expect a lot of rambling.<br><br>TLDR: Name is Constel, brains were removed by daleks and are used by Sherlock in his experiments with orcs. Hi!</p>

            <p>Greetings, the starlit doctor!<br><br>I am a writer, who writes anything that stops by (I&#39;ve got really slow at it, though). Mainly fantasy, currently modern fantasy and postapocalyptica, plus occasional attempts of murder mysteries (ack!). When it comes to reading, I&#39;ll devour anything that catches my eye, be it science fiction or steampunk.<br><br>I am indeed a LARPer, and quite proud of it! LARP, aka Live Action Role-Playing, is a nice mix of traditional RPG/D&amp;D and improvisation theatre, at least that&#39;s how I usually explain it. There are many different types, from simplistic swordfight-centered games to highly political and detailed games (Vampire: The Masquerade is the most known example).<br><br>Fun stories? Too many to write &#39;em all up! :D Well... My current very favourite is from my latest game - we NPCs, some sort of underground-monsters, kidnapped a PC, dragged him to the beach, put him on a picnic table (&quot;Feast!&quot;) and started performing rituals. Other PCs came to look for us and got lost in the woods. While they were searching their way out, we danced around the table, made random loud noises, harassed said PC, included a lot of off-topic blabbering and dirty jokes (because when there are more than one LARPers, there will be dirty jokes). It doesn&#39;t of course sound now anywhere near as fun as it was then...<br>I&#39;ve also heard that next day there was a tiny article in the newspaper about &#39;satanists in the beach&#39;. Just heard, nothing confirmed.<br>Oh, and fake blood that smelled good, I thought it was some sort of jam so I attempted to eat it. Not jam, but custard and red gouache paint, as it appeared later.<br><br><br>A fan, yes! I happen to be a floor fan - the kind that sits on the floor and sends warm love to everyone around. Yes, that&#39;s good.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not quite yet familiar with all the quirks of the Doctor incarnations - most of my knowledge is from Tumblr anyway - but at the very moment, Nine. His attitude towards anything is just wonderful. And the ears. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get over his ears. They look like creatures separate from his head that just happen to hang out with him.</p>

            <p>Lord of the Rings fanning means you are in quite good company. Doctor Who means I shall give you a bowtie.

            <p>Oooh boy. Just keep me away from the implausible hobbit/dragon smex so I don&#39;t completely lose my sanity...<br><br>Ye gods, really? <a href="http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Say hullo to the wiki!</a> Bionicle&#39;s a sort of science fantasy in which robots (ish) have elemental powers and kick evil&#39;s ass and are awesome, and it starts out simple and then the last couple years was a tangled mess of plot shenanigans. If that doesn&#39;t make you decide it&#39;s not your cup of tea, start with:<br><br><a href="http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Mata_Nui_Online_Game#External_Links">Where it all began.</a> This link goes straight to the External Links section because the rest of the thing is a spoilerrific play-by-play of the game.<br><br>Once you&#39;ve got to the end of that and are WTFing all over the place, go watch <a href="http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Bohrok_Online_Animations">these fun animations</a>, and <a href="http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Bohrok-Kal_Online_Animations">these ones</a>, and read <a href="http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Wall_of_History_%28BIONICLE.com%29">these fun reports</a>. Especially read the reports, they explain a couple things you&#39;d only get otherwise if you read the books.<br><br>You&#39;ll still lose a few things even then because there are a couple of things the books tell you that the game, animations, and reports only vaguely allude to, but for the 2001-early2003 era at least I think what all I linked to is pretty much enough to fumble through. Oh! And take <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/matoran.php">this</a>, it&#39;s dangerous to try to read the Matoran alphabet alone. (It&#39;s on Omniglot, how cool is that?)<br><br>Now, if you&#39;ve dug through all that and you didn&#39;t decide it was terrible, there&#39;s another (MUCH longer because grindy) game called the MNOG II, it&#39;s also findable on BIOsector01 and unless you really like running around training for a few days I recommend just reading the walkthrough since it has the same plot information, and the first Bionicle movie is on Youtube. It&#39;s called BIONICLE: The Mask of Light, and it is shamelessly cheesy. The next two movies are also on Youtube, &quot;Legends of Metru Nui&quot; and &quot;Web of Shadows&quot;, they do a pretty good job of explaining the story at least I think so even though they only vaguely allude to everything mentioned in the 2004-2005 books. <br><br>Books. Argh. If you have disposable income and what you&#39;ve seen interests you, I think they&#39;re all findable on Amazon, as are trade paperback versions of the comics though I think a lot of those are available as legitimate PDFs you can look at by checking out the links to them on BIOsector01. The book series go in the order Chronicles, Adventures, Legends. Once you get into the 2006 and onwards storyline, that being what happens in Legends until the gigantically spoilerrific ending of Legends #11 and then it&#39;s mostly the 2009 movie &quot;The Legend Reborn&quot; and <i>then</i> the story &quot;Journey&#39;s End&quot; (aaaaugh the convolutednessss), you need the books to really understand the story... and the <a href="http://www.bioniclestory.com/">online serials</a>...<br><br><a href="http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Saga_Guides">Oh look, a saga guide.</a> I&#39;ll be over here giving up on trying to show it to you the way I got it and cursing its labyrinthine means of accessing the story for making it incredibly difficult to recruit anyone to the fandom, especially over the internet.</p>

            <p>(Terri&#39;s on holiday in, er, looks like some sort of computer game, not sure what that&#39;s about, so I&#39;ll have to do my own concrit for once)<br><br>To start off: your characters are definitely characterised. I couldn&#39;t quite tell who was talking without checking the tags, but it came pretty close. It&#39;s nice to see characters who aren&#39;t interchangeable, neh?<br><br>I have to address, though, the remarkable foresight they portrayed. It comes from reading the fic before writing the mission, of course, but: before that line about the Pevensies, they made a lot of comments about the events not matching either canon. Well, no - but it seemed to be intentional, as if the author was creating a sort of collision-universe (like, say, a pretty good fic I once read where the characters and locations from the Discworld were used to play out the plot of Star Wars - it didn&#39;t make the blindest bit of sense in either canon, but it wasn&#39;t meant to). Obviously she(?) /wasn&#39;t/, it was just very bad writing - but it did seem that way.<br><br>(Oh, and did you notice the brief Harry Potter crossover? Professor Cedric &gt; Cedric Digory &gt; Digory Kirke? Mini-Aragog and mini-Dragon protection fields erected over this aside as I&#39;m not sure on the spellings and have no way of checking - most of the internet is blocked here)<br><br>On the MST thing: it was a /funny/ MST, it has to be said. If you want to make your later missions less MST-y, my advice is to use less direct quotes. I can&#39;t access my missions to check (internet, blocked, etc) but I tended to paraphrase the action most of the time, only quoting when some particular turn of phrase warranted it. That way you can slot your agents directly in.<br><br>Hypothetical example: fic says, &#39;I leapt into the tree, my feet barely touching the ground&#39;. You could quote that directly and then write &#39;&quot;She didn&#39;t jump very high, then,&quot; said Agent One&#39;, or you could miss out the quote and write something like this:<br><br>The agents watched, bemused, as Marysuewen knelt down, leapt high in the air - then grabbed a branch only just above head-height, leaving her feet about an inch above the grass. &quot;Huh,&quot; said Agent One, glancing at the words. &quot;I guess that&#39;s what you get for not checking your idioms.&quot;<br><br>(I enjoy writing, so I pepper my reviews with bizarre examples. Does this surprise anyone?)<br><br>I do like the way you integrate PPC locations and tech into your story. The mention of the Canon Library got me smiling (as always), but I liked even more the fact that it didn&#39;t have to become A Big Thing: it&#39;s just like going to the shops, just one of those things you can do. In a different way, I liked the consistant use of the Fictionary: specifically the fact that you remembered it was there, rather than having your agents default to Just Knowing after half the mission.<br><br>So hey. Good job. Fun stuff.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>About the foresight ... I find it a difficult line to walk. It&#39;s about keeping it realistic versus just getting the charge made and getting it over with.<br>And occasionally (in other missions) I have had my agents erase a charge when it turned out later that something actually did make sense.<br>But now that I think about it, maybe in the future I could smooth some of it over, by sending the agents much more detailed Intelligence Reports and having them refer to those. &quot;Oh, the Intelligence Report mentioned that the fic had not even bothered to look up the names of some of the characters,&quot; Mittens said. &quot;This must be one of those cases.&quot;<br><br>I did in fact notice the HP crossover, but I didn&#39;t have any great ideas except to drag Cedric Digory in for a cameo, so I let it slide. So no minis there. Not like the Agents need another mini-Aragog anyway.<br><br>I&#39;ve thought long and hard about how many direct quotes to use. I think that there&#39;s even a bit of a school of thought among some Boarders, that direct quotes should be kept to an absolute minimum. And the Original Series certainly got by without using a lot.<br>So why I am so fond of them? Partly because my missions and way of making fun of the badness are very much influenced by the Nostalgia Critic and since that show is about movies and clips from the actual bad scenes are shown, it spills over into my form of missionwriting and the natural thing for me becomes to show the clip, rather than paraphrase it.<br>And I suppose I also simply have a twisted sense of justice. I want to the evidence out there for people to see for themselves, that no, I did not make it up and I did not exaggerate it.<br>But yeah, that is a balance as well and something I will have to mull over.<br><br>Oh dear, I hope it doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m making a lot of excuses, because I know how annoying that is. I&#39;m merely trying to explain how I think when I write and that there are still some things I am struggling with finding the balance in. I admit I&#39;m far from perfect, but I try to improve with every mission and I&#39;m grateful for your and Ellipsis Flood&#39;s comments.<br><br>(At least I&#39;ve gotten over my fixation that every single charge must be witnessed and written down (and later read). I did that at one point and it made for incredibly long missions.)</p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve been looking at some stuff involving Magical Girl Lyrical Nahona, particularly some of the more destructive attacks, and the Transformation Sequences, and two questions popped into my head. One, is it possible for a portal to redirect laser beams? (Ex. Opening a portal in front of the oncoming Death Ray, and redirect the blast to hit a marauding Magical Girl Sue) Two, can an Agent interrupt a Transformation Sequence? (Ex. Hitting a Sailor Earth-type Sue in the face with a pie while she&#39;s changing into her Magical Girl outfit)</p>

            <p>Wow, welcome to the wonderful world of Nanoha! Anyways, onto answers:<br><br>1) It probably depends on the kind of attack. Starlight breaker is probably fine, but Fate&#39;s giant Zanber attack that she uses to destroy the BoD&#39;s shields, which is essentially an enormous laser sword, probably could not.<br><br>2) Again, it depends on the Magical Girl. In the first season of Nanoha, the transformation takes a few seconds, and can be interrupted, but there&#39;s a strong barrier spell around her to protect. I have no idea how it works for Sailors, but go with Rule of Funny. </p>

            <p>1) is certainly possible. Hopwerever, the poeral should be actually bigger than the width of the beam, otherwise crazy stuff might happen.<br><br>2) depends on the series. For example, Nanoha has transformation sequences, but they are instantaneous to the outside viewer. Same thing for Madoka Magica. I don&#39;t know in Sailor Moon, though.</p>

            <p>Another newbie here, although I&#39;ve known about the PPC for...more than a year, at least. Two years? Two and a half? I have no idea. All I know is that seeing Cupcakes get the sporking it so richly deserved provoked me to a fit of PPC-joining nerdrage. I have a maternal spot for rough and tumble characters.<br><br>Anyway, I have a lot of fandoms, but I think I&#39;m the most educated about the Warriors series by Erin Hunter; My Little Ponies: Friendship is Magic by...ehm...Hasbro; Dragon Ball Z (just Z - I haven&#39;t watched the original yet, and GT sickens me); Naruto (just the original, I haven&#39;t caught up with Shippuden yet); World of Warcraft (shameless WoW nerd); Lord of the Rings; and (please do not hit/bomb/spit on/kick/set me on fire) Twilight.<br><br>I&#39;m decently versed in the Tamora Pierce universe as a whole (particularly the Trickster duet and the Beak Cooper trilogy) and the general works of Edgar Allen Poe. I also know my way quite well around Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and The Merchant of Venice - by Shakespeare, of course.<br><br>Too Long? Didn&#39;t Read?: I am a massive Warriors/Tamora Pierce/Edgar Allen Poe/Shakespeare/DBZ/Naruto/Lord of the Rings/World of Warcraft/Twilight (DON&#39;T KILL ME PLEASE) nerd.

            <p>Five newbies in a little over one week! That must be some kind of record. I used to read Warriors when I was younger, but I feel like each series got progressively worse. I don&#39;t really agree with you on Twilight, but I respect your opinion. Plus you like Poe and Shakespeare, so all is forgiven. Since you&#39;re a brony/ pegasister, I hereby present you with a unicorn hat complete with mane.</p>

            <p>No. No no no, Kitty. You haven&#39;t seen giant introduction posts until you&#39;ve seen <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=227126;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">mine</a>. 1413 words and counting. Now <i>that</i> was a massive teal deer of a post, considering I&#39;ve posted complete oneshots shorter than it. (One, and by a grand total of 12 words, but still.)<br><br>Anyway! Warriors. My little sister&#39;s into that, but I haven&#39;t bothered to stare at it until I can tell where to start. Ponies? Ponies are awesome. DBZ, heard of, heard of memes, never watched. Naruto, haven&#39;t quite gotten into that yet. WoW, I&#39;m on Starter Edition and am an Alliance Dwarf Hunternoob except the trolls and tauren are pretty cool but I have Opinions and they&#39;re all &quot;THRALL COME BACK&quot;. LORD OF THE RINGS YESSSSSSSSSSS. As for Twilight, well... like what you like, and what do you think of Luminosity/Radiance by Alicorn?<br><br>I have all of the Immortals quartet. I swear. Glod only knows where Wild Magic is, but I bought all of &#39;em. And I&#39;ve read the Circle books (first two quartets anyhow and the Empress book). Never managed to finish reading the Alanna books or PotS. I know only Poe things which are firmly engrained in the public consciousness (Nevermore!). I found Romeo and Juliet annoying as hell when I did it for high school just because they were a pair of idiots, but the story itself was fun. &#39;Fraid I haven&#39;t read any other Shakespeare-y stuff... wait no, his sonnets, they&#39;re on Wikipedia.<br><br>And again. <i>Your</i> post is a massive not teal deer. :P</p>

            <p>I fear babbling when I meet new people. -shruggles-<br><br>With Warriors, the very first book is &quot;Warriors #1: Into the Wild&quot;. It should have a bright orange tabby on the front and a forest as the background.<br><br>PONIES ARE THE BOMB. -loverage-<br><br>Son Gohan (Junior, I guess, or would it be Son Gohan II since Grandpa Gohan died before he was born?) was my very first anime crush. And my longest. Neji from Naruto comes in a close second for length of time.<br><br>Thrall absolutely needs to come back, because Garrosh fails at diplomacy - although his reaction to the events in the Horde questline for the Stonetalon Mountains made me happy.<br><br>Lord of the Rings fills me with warm, fuzzy feelings. Especially Haldir, Glorfindel, Erestor, and the El Twins. They need more love.<br><br>I haven&#39;t read Luminsoity/Radiance...or seen it...or done any other verb that matches the medium it is presented in.<br><br>I&#39;ve read the Trickster duet so many times I need to buy new books for it - the old ones are beginning to fall apart. I read three-fourths of the Immortals quartet, but someone lost/loaned out/threw away the fourth book, and then I donated the other three, so it&#39;s been a while. I read Magic Steps (or whatever), I think that&#39;s related. Main female protagonist was named something like Sandra??<br><br>I read &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; in second grade at Halloween. I have been mindlessly hooked ever since - &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; is my absolute favorite. And the inner romantic in me died reading your comment about Romeo and Juliet - but the rest of me agrees and is cackling maniacally. Macbeth is wonderful (aside from the titular character failing to have a spine around his wife...) and The Merchant of Venice might make you cry, if you sympathize with Shylock.<br><br>-pant wheeze cough-<br><br>My fingers are sore...writing this AND working on my book...Oi vey...</p>

Very much yes. Macku (a Matoran, littler and weaker but no less freaking AWESOME) throws herself in front of an attack that would have killed her not-boyfriend Hewkii (a Toa, awesome with awesomer powers). Jaller takes <i>another</i> hit for his best friend Takanuva that kills him <i>again</i>, this time for good and with no dramatic death speeches, but it also would have hit Jaller&#39;s formerly-canonical-girlfriend (see the retcon) Hahli so hehehe it&#39;s a twofer.<br><br>Also I took the running gag of Toa Lewa getting mind-controlled and having to be beaten up by Toa Onua to get his mind back, twisted it, and killed them both. Lewa beats up Onua badly enough that Onua&#39;s dying by the time Lewa finally gets sense smacked into him, and when not even Onua&#39;s Mask of Strength can keep him up any longer Lewa wallops baddies to protect Onua&#39;s body until he&#39;s overwhelmed too. And for some very odd reason I&#39;m thinking this whole thing happens at the base of and in the shade of the only tree in a field, what the heck is my imagination on.<br><br>So&#39;s mine.</p>

For &quot;Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies,&quot; we made the seven guys in our choir dress up in brightly-colored tutus and do twirls through the aisles in the audience.

            <p>Oh, fudge! I love being the newbie!<br><br>Staging Shakespeare in a time period other than what was originally intended...<br><br>If it&#39;s done as a parody, then it&#39;s bloody hilarious. Otherwise, either do it well, or don&#39;t waste your time. I saw a post-apocalyptic of Oedipus: Tyrant once, and it had great music, great potential, but AWFUL actors and actresses.

            <p>*The required permission request elements can be found under their respective titles in this thread.*<br><br>Now events on the board have settled down a little, I have decided to make a permission request. I outlined a pair of agents in a character thread several weeks ago (that has since dropped into the depths beyond the bottom of the front page). Firstly, many thanks for the replies to that one - they were gratefully received. I did post some answers to July&#39;s questions, but I certain other events on the board at that time (quite understandably) demanded rather more attention. I have, however, modified and refined my agents since then. I think I also have my answer thread saved somewhere if anybody wants to see it again.<br><br>I have been thinking about what really gets me about bad writing and technical errors is it. As such, both agents will, if allowed, belong to the Department of Technical Errors, with the reason for the pairing being for Eagrus to train Cyba in being a PPC agent while some of her sci-fi and science knowledge hopefully rubs off on him. Disliking bad spelling and technical errors is one of the (few) things they agree on. They also have regular - discussions - about the merits of magic vs tech, invariably with Eagrus supporting magic and Cyba on the side of tech.<br><br>My previous plans for Cyba having an accident with the disguise generator are being kept in the wings for now, for possible use later once I&#39;m in the swing of things and the PPC trusts me with an agent with implants. It is worth noting that even once she might learn how to use them, they can be a bit temperamental about working properly (it was a FAULTY disguise generator, after all), she does not have them on most missions anyway due to disguise, and she gets completely distracted by anything red after the accident (this red problem being unaffected by disguise).<br><br></p>

            <p>After reading your permission piece, I think you&#39;ll do pretty well on missions; I await with interest. :)<br><br>Now, regarding your queries...<br><br>1. Special minis don&#39;t generally happen when a continuum&#39;s name is misspelled. If you want to make them stand out, you can always add a special feature to them, or just make them noticeably bigger than regular minis. <br><br>2. Yes, you exorcise the main &#39;Sued character to get rid of a possession!Sue, the same way exorcisms are generally carried out. Good luck, champ! :p</p>

            <p>Your writing sample was <i>excellent</i>. Snarky, amusing, and sympathetic-to-Final-Bosses - not easy to do! Very, very good.

            <p>Coming out of my standard &#39;silent lurking&#39; because of my love of Sanderson.<br><br>1) Third Heightening is... really quite powerful. &#39;Wealthy Merchant&#39; might not even cut it for justification for it. The thing about powerful characters isn&#39;t straight up that powerful = bad, but it gets closer to Sue/Stu territory. I think last time this came up the concern was that you explicitly like having powerful characters for the sake of powerful characters, and that you avoid admitting how powerful a character is in order to get your shiny. This smells exactly the same. The &quot;she fell into a gaping plot hole while chasing a bird&quot; makes me especially skeptical.<br><br>If you feel <em>that</em> strongly about having a higher BioChromatic power level, I&#39;d go with Second Heightening, much closer to 200 than 600 Breaths (seriously, 600? It&#39;s a freaking lot).<br><br>2) Writing sample: to be harsh, it made my eyes bleed a little. It read like you were writing Wheel of Time fanfic for someone who doesn&#39;t read Wheel of Time. The result sounded like &quot;Wheel of Time for Dummies.&quot; If someone&#39;s reading WoT fic, they already know these basics. If some doesn&#39;t, it just comes across as clumsy. Other, less explanatory-details-oriented clumsy sentences include: &quot;She paid the scribe the twenty-seven crowns she had paid for Talavin.&quot; More importantly, however...<br><br><em>Grammar</em>. You <em>consistently</em> abuse the rules of punctuation, especially governing comma placement with dialogue. In fact, you do so in almost every line of speech. You also left out some periods at the ends of sentences. It means not only are you beyond careless with punctuation, but either your work is un-beta&#39;d or you choose <em>seriously</em> sub-par betas.<br><br>On the off-chance you take my criticism to heart and change it: I applaud your decision. However, it came after effectively publishing it. It doesn&#39;t count.<br><br>Periods at the ends of sentences? That&#39;s elementary school material. There is no excuse.</p>

            <p>Mainly on the basis of your sample.  I honestly only read about a page and a half of it, but that was more than enough.  There are spelling, punctuation, and grammar mistakes everywhere.  Some of them would have easily been caught by a spell-checker, which kinda says that you didn&#39;t even try to edit.<br><br>Of the mistakes that wouldn&#39;t be caught by a spell-checker, here are some of the highlights (emphasis mine in all cases):<br>-You used &#39;seen&#39; instead of &#39;seemed&#39;.<br>-You used &#39;right&#39; instead of &#39;write&#39;.<br>-&quot;The sun beat down harshly on the backs of the slaves being sold, which were bared to <b>better</b> allow prospective buyers to <b>better</b> view their purchases.&quot;<br>-There are several instances of tenses not agreeing. For instance: &quot;The auctioneer began to call out prices as the bidding <b>reach</b> twenty crowns&quot;<br>-&quot;As the woman turned away, her small <b>encourage</b> followed her&quot;<br>-You used &#39;women&#39; when you were clearly referring to a single woman.

            <p>Based on knowledge of other canons by Sanderson and previous threads, I have some concerns about Kiira&#39;s power levels and abilities, but I&#39;m not acquainted with the canon.

            <p>So here are my Agent ideas.<br><br>Ivan:<br>(Star Colonel) Ivan is a generic Clanner of the Battletech universe. He existed to act as an arch-enemy to a &#39;Modern girl in Battletech&#39; Sue. With the Sue killed by Agents, Ivan was recruited. As a clanner, Ivan is physically superior to average humans, but his honor code prevents him from exploiting it most of the time. His life in a Suefic has left him with a tendency to speak like a stereotypical archvillain, complete with maniacal laughter. Ivan tends to snub most people, but he respects the Flowers for their skill as leaders.<br><br>Susan: (Unit 3051-1337-SSN of the Line)<br>Susan is a Bolo, a giant artificially intelligent tank, from an abandoned crossover. The author decided to copy the plot of one canon book, and left Susan, heavily damaged, hurried under layers of sediment. She was to be found, but the crossover was abandoned. Susan somehow found her way to DoSAT, but her severe damage has left her at a fraction of her former fighting strength. She is shrunk down to a reasonable size, to allow her to travel HQ&#39;s corridors. Susan&#39;s programming is to defend Humanity, and as Sues cause damage to Canon humans, then she must hunt Sues. Due to &#39;Morality&#39; programming, she must prevent harm to humans unless there is no way to help without risking other humans.</p>

            <p>Sounds like a great thing to have around HQ - and fortunately I think most of my remaining agents are human. Out of interest, what would her programming dictate if, say, an Elven agent tried to assassinate a human Sue in front of her? On the one hand you&#39;ve got the &#39;this is a Mary-Sue, she hurts other humans by warping them&#39;, but on the other hand you&#39;ve got &#39;this is a non-human attacking a human in front of me&#39;.<br><br>As to Ivan... he sounds like an interesting ground to work from. Not much to him so far (in this summary, at least), but that&#39;s okay, characters can be built on the go. I do wonder about his perceptiveness, though -- he seriously thinks the <i>Flowers</i> are skilled <i>leaders</i>? Something seriously wrong there. :P<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve just made a pledge on Indiegogo for a project I think is genuinely awesome and deserves to be made real.<br>And I think to myself, &#39;Hey, the PPC is full of people who appreciate awesome; I should go tell them&#39;. Also, if we tilt our heads and squint, the project is kinda-sorta relevant for PPC interests.<br>I&#39;m not necessarily looking to get people to donate, although that of course would be nice. It&#39;s just as much about saying &#39;hey, this cool project is out there&#39; and then people can go &#39;neat!&#39; and go on doing what they were doing.<br><br>But then I suddenly realised that I don&#39;t know whether it is even permissible or not. I have seen links to petitions, but I can&#39;t recall ever seeing one to a Kickstarter or Indiegogo. (Then again, I am the supreme lord of scatterbrains. Quite possibly there was two last week and I simply overlooked them.)<br>Maybe I&#39;m overthinking this, but I thought I&#39;d go and ask before doing something stupid.<br><br>*looks back at post* I sure do use a lot of words today.<br><br>TLDR: Is there a policy on posting links to fundraising projects? Is there a total ban, a they-have-to-be-relevant-to-the-PPC-policy (which I think my link might just fall under) or are we allowed to post them if we feel like it?</p>

            <p>So uh this was originally going to be a massive post but then I realized it would be easier if I made it into a Google Docs anyone with the link could look at and comment on and just posted a much smaller thing explaining what and why.<br><br>TL;DR: Lielac is writing a Bionicle/Hero Factory crossover, and would like the help of Bionicle fans in particular and anyone who wants to help in general to decide how and when and why to kill everyone. Also other plot ideas. And yes, when she posts it she will credit everyone who helps her in this as being awesome, awesome people.<br><br>This story will be a continuation from the end of Bionicle canon, and as such casual spoilers in the comments (not in the comment titles, though, people!) are probably a thing that are going to happen while I pound it out. Also, right now I&#39;m focusing on the many ways to kill people, and this is probably going to get into some detail. <b>Trigger warning</b> for basically anything related to a war and the psychological reprecussions of friends watching friends die. If this story ends up only PG-13 I am going to be very surprised, though it&#39;s focused on Bionicle characters so the barely-safe-for-me is just going to be blood, guts, gore, and veins in their teeth instead of other reasons. Suicidal ideation might very well be mentioned as a character motivation for doing really stupid things that end up getting them killed, so... yeah.<br><br>Comments can be placed here or on the doc itself, though I think I&#39;d prefer comments as to plotty things being hammered out in comments on the doc.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfcUAwJPHNq3e5MHGsfGbWEvRY98kC76pp2w1eAVJgs/edit">Right, then, here&#39;s the link.</a><br><br>Oh! Because I totally forget things, the comments here can be for story ideas I forgot that aren&#39;t about killing all our favorite characters in ways that make us cry. Like, um, what Nuju and Nuparu are doing instead of dying. Or the whole giant plot of &quot;the Matoran go out into space and meet nasties&quot;, which is <i>why</i> they die out so violently and so should really get some love. Or suggestions for what I should read as examples of what (not) to do when I get into actually writing this. (I already have How Not To Write a Novel, for those of you who might suggest it.)</p>

            <p>Do you need permission of any sort to create a Spy to work in the Department of Intelligence and send in badfic reports?  While I don&#39;t have any Agent ideas now, I am considering creating one or two after a bit, so if somebody could answer, that&#39;d be great.</p>

            <p>DoI isn&#39;t owned by anyone, so you don&#39;t have to ask specifically to make a Spy, but to write stories with them, you need standard Permission.<br><br>That&#39;s assuming by &#39;badfic reports&#39; you mean the usual combination of an account of the Spy&#39;s adventure in the story, followed by a formal report giving details to any agent who might be assigned to it. If you <i>just</i> wanted to write the formal report (Title, Type of Badfic, whatever else we put on them - can&#39;t get at the Wiki to check), which would basically be like sharing it on the Board but attaching an agent&#39;s name to it, I don&#39;t see that you&#39;d need Permission for <i>that</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sudden idea!<br><br> What if, when she wrote <i>Twilight</i>, Meyer intended it as a parody of all the stuff that&#39;s wrong with our world, with the fairytales people tell kids every night? It would make her a hipster of sorts, but this whole thing could be a joke about how messed up everything is! Anyone else think this makes a lick of sense?</p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve read any of her author interviews, or just about anything else she&#39;s said, it&#39;s clear that she really is 100% sincere.  She honestly believes that Edward is the single most wonderful romantic interest in all of literature, and that everyone should wish that they were Bella.<br><br>The book&#39;s details are even well-documented.  It began from a dream she had, about a girl in a meadow talking to the most beautiful boy in the world, who sparkled.  He was telling her that they couldn&#39;t be together because he was dangerous.  Meyer was immediately captivated, and felt she had to write their story.<br><br>It&#39;s unfortunately very earnest, and that&#39;s the biggest problem with it.  Were it a parody, it would be far more accepted, because that implies a self-awareness and acknowledgement that this stuff is super screwed up.  Even if it had been written differently, the story of a girl deluded into thinking that a creepy monster stalker was her True Love could be an effective meta-horror story, and a very deep, cutting commentary on romanticism and naпvetй.  But it&#39;s presented as the most perfect happy romance <i>ever</i>, and that&#39;s the problem.</p>

            <p>I am rereading the series for the purposes of real-life MSTing it with my friends. Now that you mention it, things ARE pretty ridiculous - most notably the constant presence of vampires in town without anyone noticing. Sure, they take precautions, but at least A FEW people have to be suspicious by Eclipse. They were already muttering about the Cullens in New Moon, but suddenly Eclipse starts and POOF! No more suspicions, until Bella gets married at eighteen.<br><br>As I hail from a(n admittedly elitist) small town myself, I can tell you everyone would be actively discussing the Cullens immediately following the car accident in Twilight and asking some tough questions by the end of New Moon.<br><br>Also, if we&#39;re comparing Twilight to Beauty and the Beast - which I&#39;m going to, because pudding - I think Seth Clearwater is like a shape-shifter version of Chip. I like Seth~</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s break it down, then:<br><br>-Bella is, obviously enough, the Fairytale Princess. She&#39;s that character who bemoans her tragic state while at the same time getting everything she wants - and, big hint, ends up using The Power Of Love. Shades of Disney&#39;s Sleeping Beauty here, I suppose, or Little Mermaid, only less the &#39;I want to do more&#39; and more, um, &#39;My boyfriend is a carnivorous predator&#39;. To paraphrase Jay, there&#39;s never been a Disney film about /that/.<br><br>(I&#39;m not counting Beauty and the Beast. Because I don&#39;t want to)<br><br>-Edward is Prince Charming if he were a real member of the nobility. &#39;I am so luscious and I want to kill you and drink your blood&#39;. He (along with the werewolves) has that Love At First Sight (actually Sniff) thing going on, so yeah, Sparkleboy is definitely a parody. He also has shades of Peter Pan - Never Grows Up.<br><br>-Jacob is the Big Bad Wolf in his purest form - a character (wolf, in fact) who exists solely to get in the way of Twu Wuv. He&#39;s almost a thematic reversal of the Wolf, though, since rather than being unambiguously evil, he&#39;s, er, pretty much the most sympathetic character in there. If Edward is the Unattainable Noble, Jacob is the Down-to-earth Type. Edward lounges around in forests, Jacob&#39;ll help you build a motorbike.<br><br>And that is essentially how it would actually be in several Disney films. Beauty and the Beast actually works really well here - in that, bookish Belle is fascinated by the reclusive, standoffish noble Beast, while shunning the townsman Gaston. Okay, sure, Gaston is shown as a Very Bad Chap - but that&#39;s the Disney Filter in operation. He is less rich, he does not have a castle, therefore he must be bad. Jacob is poorer, lives in the woods, does not sparkle, and therefore must be Not The One.<br><br>As to the rest of the vamp!cast... well, Alice is both good and wicked fairy (think Sleeping Beauty - the good ones make prophecies, Maleficent is insane... Alice is both. Classical Seeress), Esme and Carlisle are fairly generic King and Queen characters (with which, shades of Aragorn in the Doctor-Ruler?), and the others... you&#39;ve got the Wicked (or at least Grumpy) Stepsister in Rosalie, and, er, I honestly can&#39;t remember enough about Emmett and Jasper to comment.<br><br><i>And</i>, you have to take The Host into account. It was written before Twilight, and it&#39;s actually not all that bad. Romance, yes (which puts it outside my usual genres), but reasonably realistic characters. Even if it is pro-Yeerk propaganda.<br><br>hS thinks too much</p>

            <p>... is that <i>we&#39;ve already lost</i>. It&#39;s not a story about Humanity&#39;s Resistance To The Invaders - or about Those Poor Subjugated Aliens - it&#39;s about <i>Earth under occupation</i>. Worse than occupation - humanity is, for all intents and purposes, extinct. Even counting controlled people who still retain some part of their minds, you&#39;re looking at way more than a 99% extinction rate.<br><br>It shares this with... not a lot, actually. <i>The Dalek Invasion of Earth</i> has that same &#39;So here&#39;s the aliens... oh, they&#39;re already in charge&#39; effect, but loses out to being from the 60s. More recently (and still in Doctor Who) you have Last of the Time Lords, which was equally scary (until the ending) with it&#39;s depiction of an Earth not embattled, but... conquered. Subjugated. Finished.<br><br>But both of those had a single point of failure that let it be wrapped up by the end. The Host doesn&#39;t. The only real hope it offers after the closing pages is... that the survivors might survive a bit better now.<br><br>It&#39;s a scary book.<br><br>So why did she move on to sparkly vampires?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, as of today, the 20th of August, I’ve been a part of the PPC for five years now.<br><br>That is a nice, even number, which is why I am officially quitting as of today.<br><br>For those of you wondering why I have chosen to quit, or are wanting to ask me to stay, I&#39;ve been feeling this way for months now, even after the events of last year and the mass of bullying &#39;ended&#39;.  This is because it never really did, it just went quiet until people thought it was forgotten about and could attack me for various reasons to satiate their various grudges.<br><br>I’ve become disliked by many people, repeatedly, and am often at the center of many attacks just because I made a good target. That, if anything, is an excellent reason to leave. To make it explicit: I haven’t felt safe here for nearly two years now.  <br><br>Beyond that, the PPC has a glaring lack of competent writers, and has many people who call themselves PPCers being disrespectful of writers- this is, given the intended fundamental nature of the PPC, a large problem.  There&#39;s a huge, constant stream of disrespect at people in and out of the community that&#39;s  constantly ongoing, and it only happens when the people who will call it out aren&#39;t around to slam down on it.<br><br>There are many people who don’t bother reading, and become disgruntled when they’re told they should read. This goes hand in hand with the above- a community centered around writing and reading becomes hypocritical when the community itself insults writers but cannot write, and will not read. <br><br>Other reasons are just the fact that the PPC&#39;s just decayed so much. We should never&#39;ve been in a position where we had people going &#39;homophobia is acceptable on the board because we can&#39;t tell someone that opinion is bad&#39;, or with someone spamming up the board to demand to know what was going on because they wouldn&#39;t bother to read.<br><br>Beyond that, &#39;creepy&#39; has seeped into the PPC. I will never associate myself willingly with people who apologize for rape, accept pedophilia, condone bestiality, much less practice or fantasize about any of those things.  Those things do <i>not</i> fall under &#39;Your Kink Is Not My Kink&#39;. This is one of the reasons I am leaving. <br><br>It&#39;s bunch of stuff that&#39;s not changing, and has only been getting worse.<br><br>While I love what the PPC was, and the underlying ideas of it, I hate the community and what it&#39;s become, and what it has been doing to me, and don&#39;t want to associate myself with it anymore.<br><br>To that end, I&#39;m officially retiring most of my agents; I am leaving Agent Library in Makari&#39;s good hands for a few more missions, and am leaving Building Maintenance to Huinesoron if he&#39;d like use of them. <br><br>The wiki is in good hands; Neshomeh&#39;s, and Doctorlit&#39;s. <br><br>Finally, I would like Cassie to take on the role of Permission Giver.<br><br>If anyone has anything to ask me, or anything they&#39;d like to say, they are welcome to do so; I will reply to things for the next day or so. <br><br>I think that&#39;s everything for now.<br><br><br>So, <a href="http://youtu.be/bG6b3V2MNxQ">so long, and thanks for all the fish.</a><br><br>-JulyFlame</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been... interesting, to say the least. Not gonna lie, I am not exactly distraught over you leaving. You made people I care for vary deeply feel uncomfortable, and bullied. On the other hand, you&#39;ve also been there for me, and people I care about, so some part of me will miss you. You&#39;re a good friend to those you call friends, usually, and for that I respect you, and am grateful. <br><br>For whatever it&#39;s worth, I never held a grudge against you. Any time we disagreed, I focused purely on the matter at hand, or at least tried to. Well, except for that last time, but I got over that relatively quickly, and never really did more than make the one rather unsubtle comment.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m starting to ramble just a bit, and I&#39;m sure this is not what you want to hear, from someone you probably don&#39;t want to hear from, so I&#39;m gonna end this here.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t like you. You snipe at people and say a lot of hurtful things, constantly, and harass people, even when they tell you to leave them alone. <br><br>You get into arguments with people and play innocent while you attack them; when you come into the channel in the middle of a civilized debate, you pick seemingly at random someone and start attacking them for &#39;fighting&#39; and being mean, and shout at them in private messages.  <br><br>You&#39;re a hypocritical jerk. <br><br>You&#39;re one of the reasons I don&#39;t feel safe here. </p>

            <p>I really don&#39;t know what to say. Nothing I can think of can even begin to do this goodbye justice.<br>For as long as I&#39;ve been here, it always seemed that you were the one that kept things running. You told people what they couldn&#39;t do and why they couldn&#39;t do it. You weren&#39;t afraid to tell people the cold, hard truth about their writing. I would love to be able to convince you to stay, but you seem to be set in your decision, as you always are. So goodbye July. Go out and share your talents with others. Become an editor, it seems like the perfect job for you. But always remember that if you ever decide to come back there will be people here to welcome you.</p>

            <p>She is waiting for her episode of Doctor Who to load and, as is reflex, she checks the Board for any new interesting posts. She sees the post by PitViper and grins because it has given her an opportunity to eat digital cake and play Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Balrog. She also finds it necessary to point out that almost everyone on the Board is older than her, as she is only fifteen. She then gets over it because it&#39;s not really that big a deal and she should quit whining. She offers PitViper a large colorful cake and then shoves it in her face, as is tradition.

            <p>In order to unite the scattered tribes of the PPC into a more perfect union - or just because I&#39;ve always been quite fascinated by the idea of large numbers of people working together on something like this - I propose a Mega-project. Not a mega-crossover (we&#39;ve had a bunch of those) but a project. Something we haven&#39;t done before. Something we can look at afterwards and say, &quot;You know what? <i>We made that</i>. We&#39;re pretty awesome when we work together.&quot;<br><br>I have a few proposals, arranged in rough order of preference. They mostly consist of everyone doing a little thing, and one person (me) doing a lot of background work to integrate it.<br><br>-<b>A PPC Community Choir</b>: My definite favourite. This would involve everyone who can recording themselves singing the same song (I&#39;m thinking the one written by Gary Barlow and Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Queen&#39;s diamond jubilee - I think it&#39;s called &#39;Sing&#39;, and it&#39;s a really nice song), at the same speed (ie, to a recording), and sending it in to me. I would then mix them all together and create a choir effect. If possible, this would involve some people also sending videos of themselves singing it, so a fair number of those could appear (likely multi-panel&#39;d, so not just one person at a time).<br><br>I think it would a) sound very impressive (the &#39;I can&#39;t sing!!1&#39; aspect would be drowned out - and I&#39;d only use your best bits, so you wouldn&#39;t even need to record it all), b) be easy for everyone else (it would take literally ten minutes), and c) ... just be awesome. But yes, I came up with alternatives.<br><br>-<b>The PPC Community Poster</b>: You know those mosaic things where a bunch of tiny pictures make up one huge image? I have a program that can make those. If everyone sent in a picture of themselves, I could make them come together into something bigger - probably a picture of the SO, this is the PPC after all, but something else if people prefer.<br><br>-<b>The PPC Community Choose-Your-Own-Adventure</b>: This would be very easy to do with a wiki (either as a subset of The Wiki or a standalone): create a start page, create two dead-link options leading off it. The next person chooses which one they want to follow, clicks, and (if the page doesn&#39;t exist) writes the next part of the story. It builds up a CYOA that never has to end (though it can), and which builds itself. The reason I don&#39;t particularly like this one is that &#39;let&#39;s write a story together&#39; is <i>not</i> something we&#39;ve never done before - and it doesn&#39;t immediately give the impression of a community working as one.<br><br>-<b>The PPC Community Spiderweb</b>: This is the one I could actually just about do by myself (if I had all forever). Make a chart which draws links between every agent of the PPC, and everyone they&#39;ve shared a page with. It could also, theoretically, be done with authors who&#39;ve written together, but that would be very sparse. Boarders who&#39;ve met or chatted is another option, but the former would be almost nonexistent, while the latter might as well be designated &#39;Everyone---Everyone else&#39;. I quite like this in principle, but a) it&#39;s story-related again, and b) not everyone in the Community writes missions, so it would be exclusive. On the other hand, I may have to make one for my own cast of reprobates already.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So... are any of them appealing to anyone? You can probably tell which I&#39;m driving for, but I know some people get distraught at the thought of their voice or miniscule portrait appearing on the Internets (they eat your soul, you know), so I came up with alternatives. And if they don&#39;t appeal - can you think of anything that does?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(Yes, in addition to the Spiderweb. This one will take you literally five minutes, so I figure you&#39;ll handle it)<br><br>The PPC Community Poster will be a tiled mosaic of the PPC Wiki logo, made up of the pictures you send in instead of pixels. For your part, all you (yes, you - even if you&#39;ve only been here five minutes, you&#39;re still a member of the PPC community!) have to do is send in your picture - and your name. These don&#39;t have to be sent together - separate emails, separate email addresses, or an anonymous email with a note here to say you&#39;ve sent, I don&#39;t care. I just want to be able to put a credits list in.<br><br>As to &#39;your picture&#39;, that can be any of the following (although it&#39;s vastly preferable to send in the first):<br><br>-A photograph of yourself.<br>-A photograph of yourself when you were unrecognisably younger.<br>-A digitally modified photo of yourself.<br>-A drawing (/painting/etc) of yourself.<br>-A doll-maker image of yourself (/Sims portrait/whatever - but try to make it look like you).<br>-A photo of something you think symbolises you.<br><br>It <i>cannot</i> be any of the following:<br><br>-A photo of someone else. The only exception to this is photos of animals - but I would prefer that they be ones you have taken yourself, not one you pulled off the first page of Google.<br>-Clipart. That&#39;s just lazy.<br>-Anything that would raise the raiting or discomfort level. Photos of you with no clothes on making a rude gesture with one hand while hugging Fidel Castro with the other are not appropriate (although the CIA might want to talk to you...).<br>-In a non-standard format which requires me to search the internet for something that reads .zqr files.<br><br>My email address is above, or can be reached simply as my username at hotmail dot com.<br><br>(And if you have something you&#39;d like to send in but you&#39;re not sure it fits, heck, send it anyway. Inclusion is more fun that rules-lawyering)<br><br>hS, hoping this works</p>

            <p>There is a Spiderweb by now, but why not to attempt others too? I personally can&#39;t quite pick a favourite, but currently rooting for Poster. I don&#39;t sing very well - some practice needed - and CYOA could get really messy. So yes, poster.<br>While sending in pictures could get &quot;don&#39;t give out information&quot; alarm for some people, we could make some turns in there. Maybe let people draw pictures of themselves (or Agents, if they have) and send those - paint-people aren&#39;t probably that easily recognizable as photo-people. Or a picture of something that they think symbolizes them (I&#39;m still attempting to make a PPC uniform, that means DMS flash patch).<br><br>Or a PPC live action film, where only problem (and a big problem) is getting participants in the same place. I sometimes imagine missions as really fancy cop shows... my brain has clearly seen too much TV crime.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t tried that one, but when I made an UNTIL uniform (out of the Champions universe) a couple Costume Cons ago I used fabric paint for both the division badge and the UNTIL logo on the combat vest.

            <p>While each option seems fun, there are a few flaws that io&#39;d like to point out:<br><br>1) For the first and second option, it would require sending in pictures and videos which, if you&#39;re like me and you&#39;ve had it drilled into your head not to share personal information/ pictures/ amorous messages with people on the internet, is something that many people would be reluctant to do.<br><br>2)Also for the first one, many people have voiced their concern about not being able to sing, which doesn&#39;t really matter as we&#39;re not auditioning for Broadway, but less people are going to want to share if their singing is not up to par, diminishing from the choir effect. Also, I don&#39;t have any means of recording myself.<br><br>3)The third option seems the most feasible in terms of everyone agreeing on it and participating, but a) how will we end it and b) how can we make sure that the quality of writing is up to snuff, especially if it has a lot of different options to sort through.<br><br>4) Though yo&#39;ve already started the spiderweb, I need to point out that doing it by agents would not include anyone who does not have permission and, as I said below, many people&#39;s agents do not interact with the agents of other authors.<br><br>All that being said, I think the CYOA would probably work out the best, as long as it&#39;s kept under control. Maybe have deadlines for the story to end, or a maximum amout of links per story line? Dunno, but I&#39;d really like to work on something like that.</p>

            <p>1/ I understand this exists, but since I am probably the most photographed person in the PPC (see, <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Other.htm">all the gatherings except Edmonton</a>), I can&#39;t say I understand <i>it</i>. Additionally, the only person who would know who was who would be me - and you can probably think of ways around that, too (eg, sending the vid/pic from one email and a note that you&#39;ve done so some time later from another).<br><br>2/ This is why I tried to present it as a fun thing, not omuguhserious. I can&#39;t sing either, you know. And I&#39;m working on the assumption that most people have a microphone or digital camera around somewhere. I may be wrong.<br><br>3/ Who says it has to end? Again, it&#39;s a community project. Anyone who wants can cap off a particular strand, but there doesn&#39;t <i>have</i> to be an end to the whole thing. If it gets nearly dead, the remaining editors could devote their time to ending each surviving thread, I suppose. As to writing quality - er, we&#39;re the PPC. We&#39;re supposed to be reasonably self-aware. If you don&#39;t think you can write well enough to do it justice (generic you, not you-you), don&#39;t write - or ask someone to beta you.<br><br>4/ I believe I noted the &#39;not everyone writes&#39; thing myself.

            <p>Caddy and I did have a discussion about that at some point during all our collaborations, since our agents are in two different Departments. We put in a scene of our agents trying to be sneaky and requesting assignments together. <br><br>As an aside, I don&#39;t know if I put the colors in wrong in my adding of stuff, or if it just translated wrong (though I&#39;m leaning towards, I messed something up), but there are a few people (Dr. Freedenberg, for sure) under the wrong color on the picture. And there are a few colors that didn&#39;t look the same on the chart I was looking at when I was picking colors, but look nearly identical on the spiderweb picture, like the magenta and hot pink, and the dark goldenrod 1 and yellow.</p>

            <p>... the only people who ever did. ;)<br><br>It is a bit of a fiddly process, and I&#39;ve been hunting down errors as I spot them (for instance, extra square brackets cause a program crash).

            <p>I&#39;ve just taken a look, and while it&#39;s good for your agents, I think there will be a bit of trouble connecting everyone else&#39;s agents. Many agents only interact with other characters by the same author, unless there&#39;s a co-write (which doesn&#39;t happen very often). The only common denominators I can think of would be if you included agents that didn&#39;t belong to anyone, like Makes-Things or Lux because eventually everyone interacts with them. Either that or include the Flowers, which would then lead to a ton of lines sprouting off that go nowhere.</p>

            <p>The point is to find the links in the community - which there are more of than you think. Note, for instance, that &#39;my&#39; agents include seven or eight different authors. I&#39;ve also cowritten with Neshomeh and kippur - and, counting the Quiddich league, I have points of contact with July and... Sara, maybe?<br><br>I&#39;ve also included at least one RP - the link from Morgan to Colt is solely from two of them, I think - and there&#39;s things like the Sue Invasion, which ties in a lot of the older agents.<br><br>Yes, some agents will stand by themselves (Sambar, for instance, hasn&#39;t interacted with anyone other than the Clover... um, ever).

            <p>All right, I&#39;ll probably jump on the CYOA bandwagon because everyone else is. But I think it would be awesome to have a Six Degrees of PPC Agent Separation-esque page in the works.</p>

            <p>I particularly like the Choir and Choose-Your-Own-Adventure ideas.<br><br>Maybe, with the choir we could do two or three songs, so everyone can get to do a song they actually recognize?  &gt;.&gt;</p>

            <p>That sounds fun! But I wonder, would t be possible to make two different offshoots of one prompt? Like, page A has options 1 and 2, and Boarders John and Jane fill those two options. Could Boarder  James write a second version of option 2? It might get complicated real quick, but it would also allow for a more complex story.</p>
