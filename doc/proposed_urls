Proposed URLs (feel free to add more)
=====================================
(get/post URLs: `get`ing gives you a form, `post`ing creates the
resource. Similar for get/put. )

get / -- Redirect to user's preferred forum view (cookie ?)

Forum views
-----------

get /subfora -- Subforum list
get /tags/all -- By tag, then thread-recent
get /subfora/[do we want slugs]/<tag id> -- Specific subforum
get /tags/<tag id> -- Thread-recent in the one tag
get /newest -- Classic mode
get /active -- Bump mode (?)
etc ......

Threads
-------

(Hm ... thread presentation style (linear/tree) should be separate
from forum viewing mode (tree-threads from a subforum would be a
thing))

get /threads/<id> -- View the thread (per preference)
get /threads/<id>/tree -- View the thread as a tree
get /threads/<id>/flat -- View the thread linearly
get /threads/<id>/reply -- Form for replying to the top-level of a
thread (alias for /posts/<top-level-post>/reply
post /threads/<id>/reply -- Add a reply to the thread
get /threads/<id>/edit -- Edit a thread (add tags, fudge timestamp etc.) 
put /threads/<id> -- Apply edits to a thread
get /threads/<id>/poof -- Form to poof the whole thread (including the
replies) [Mods only]
delete /threads/<id> -- Poof the thread


Posts
-----

get /posts/<id> -- View a post
get /posts/<id>/reply -- Form to reply to a post
post /posts/<id>/reply -- Add a reply to a post
get /posts/<id>/edit -- Form to edit a post
put /posts/<id> -- Edit a post
get /posts/<id>/poof -- Form to poof a post (only authenticated author or mod)
delete /posts/<id> -- Poof a post (not the replies ?)

Authentication and Login
------------------------

get /signup
get /users/new -- Form to add a new user account
post /users/new -- Create a new user account
get /login -- Form for logins
post /login -- Login as a user
get /users/<id> -- User's profile
get /users/<id>/posts -- Posts by user
get /users/<id>/edit -- Form to edit a profile (password change and
such) 
put /users/<id> -- Update user information
Optional: get/put /users/<id>/password -- Change user password

Hats
----

Put on mod hat; you can moderate. Put on PG hat; you look spiffy when
dealing with permission requests. Possibility: Permission Givers can
grant Permission hats, and the "Can wear Permission hat" flag grants
that account the right to post under the "PPC Stories" tag. Of course,
this is easily circumvented by not logging in, but Official Records
might come in handy.

get /hats -- See the hats you can put on
post /hats/<id> -- Put on a hat
post /hats/off -- Take off the hat you're wearing.
get/post /hats/<id>/grant -- Grant a user a hat (`get`'s the form,
`post` does it)

Administration
--------------

get /admin/bans -- Handle the various sorts of bans
get /admin/bans/new -- Ban something (such as an IP)
delete /admin/bans/<id> -- Remove a ban
Nice *optional* extra: post /admin/maintenance -- Temporarily bring
the site down
get/put /admin/settings -- Interface for changing Board settings

Miscellaneous 
-------------

get /coffee -- Return an HTTP 418 (worth looking up)
